STATISTICAL METHODS
==================

Sample Size and Power Analysis
-----------------------------
The qualitative reasoning analysis was conducted on a stratified sample of 15 transcripts 
selected to represent varying levels of scoring consistency from Experiment 3. For each 
transcript, reasoning outputs from 5 different LLM models were analyzed, yielding a total 
of 75 reasoning samples (15 transcripts × 5 models).

The sample size was determined based on the following considerations:
- Sufficient representation across consistency levels (5 high, 5 medium, 5 low consistency)
- Adequate power for detecting medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d ≥ 0.5)
- Practical constraints of manual qualitative coding

Statistical Tests Employed
--------------------------
1. **Independence Testing**: Chi-square tests of independence were used to examine 
   associations between LLM models and categorical reasoning characteristics (evidence 
   citation patterns, rubric alignment quality).

2. **Group Comparisons**: Kruskal-Wallis tests were employed for comparing ordinal 
   variables (reasoning depth, rubric alignment scores) across multiple LLM models, 
   followed by post-hoc Dunn's tests with Bonferroni correction for pairwise comparisons.

3. **Pairwise Comparisons**: Mann-Whitney U tests were used for pairwise comparisons 
   of continuous and ordinal variables, with rank-biserial correlation as the effect 
   size measure.

4. **Correlation Analysis**: Spearman's rank correlation was used to examine relationships 
   between reasoning quality measures and scoring consistency from Experiment 3, chosen 
   for its robustness to non-normal distributions and outliers.

5. **Inter-rater Reliability**: Cohen's Kappa was calculated to assess agreement between 
   different LLM models on categorical reasoning characteristics.

6. **Multivariate Analysis**: Random Forest classification was employed to identify 
   which reasoning features best distinguish between different LLM models, with 
   permutation importance used for robust feature ranking.

Multiple Comparisons Correction
------------------------------
Bonferroni correction was applied to control family-wise error rate for multiple 
pairwise comparisons. The adjusted significance level was α = 0.05/k, where k is 
the number of comparisons within each test family.

Effect Size Interpretation
-------------------------
Effect sizes were interpreted using conventional benchmarks:
- Cohen's Kappa: <0.20 (poor), 0.21-0.40 (fair), 0.41-0.60 (moderate), 
  0.61-0.80 (good), >0.80 (excellent)
- Cramér's V: <0.10 (small), 0.10-0.30 (medium), >0.30 (large)
- Rank-biserial correlation: <0.10 (small), 0.10-0.30 (medium), >0.30 (large)

Statistical Software
-------------------
All analyses were conducted using Python 3.9+ with the following packages:
- SciPy (v1.9+) for statistical tests
- scikit-posthocs for post-hoc analyses
- scikit-learn for multivariate analysis
- pandas and numpy for data manipulation

DISCUSSION
==========

Key Findings and Clinical Implications
-------------------------------------
This comprehensive statistical analysis of LLM reasoning patterns reveals several 
critical findings with important implications for clinical assessment applications:

1. **The Consistency-Reasoning Paradox**: Statistical analysis revealed an unexpected 
   inverse relationship between scoring consistency and reasoning quality. Models with 
   the highest consistency (lowest standard deviation) often provided the most 
   superficial reasoning, while models with moderate consistency demonstrated deeper 
   analytical capabilities.

2. **Evidence Citation Variability**: Significant differences in evidence citation 
   patterns across models raise concerns about the validity of assessments. Models 
   that fail to cite specific evidence from transcripts may be making judgments 
   based on general patterns rather than patient-specific communication.

3. **Rubric Alignment Heterogeneity**: The substantial variation in rubric alignment 
   quality suggests that not all models interpret assessment criteria consistently. 
   This finding has critical implications for standardized assessment applications.

Statistical Significance and Clinical Relevance
----------------------------------------------
While many statistical tests achieved significance, the clinical relevance of these 
findings extends beyond p-values:

- **Effect Sizes**: Large effect sizes (Cramér's V > 0.3, η² > 0.14) indicate that 
  the observed differences are not only statistically significant but also practically 
  meaningful for clinical applications.

- **Inter-Model Reliability**: The moderate to good inter-model agreement (κ > 0.4) 
  suggests that while models differ in their reasoning approaches, there is some 
  consistency in their categorical assessments.

- **Feature Importance**: The multivariate analysis identified key features that 
  distinguish high-quality reasoning, providing a framework for model selection 
  and evaluation.

Methodological Considerations
----------------------------
Several methodological factors should be considered when interpreting these results:

1. **Sample Size**: While the sample of 75 reasoning instances provides adequate 
   power for detecting medium to large effects, larger samples would increase 
   confidence in smaller effect sizes.

2. **Transcript Selection**: The stratified sampling approach based on consistency 
   levels ensures representation across the performance spectrum but may not fully 
   capture the diversity of real-world clinical interactions.

3. **Coding Reliability**: The qualitative coding scheme, while systematically 
   applied, introduces potential subjectivity. Future work should include 
   inter-rater reliability assessment with human coders.

Recommendations for Clinical Implementation
------------------------------------------
Based on these statistical findings, we recommend:

1. **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**: Clinical assessment tools should evaluate both 
   consistency and reasoning quality, not just one dimension.

2. **Evidence Citation Requirements**: Models used in clinical settings should be 
   required to cite specific evidence from patient interactions to ensure 
   validity and transparency.

3. **Rubric Alignment Verification**: Regular audits of rubric alignment should be 
   conducted to ensure consistent interpretation of assessment criteria.

4. **Ensemble Approaches**: Combining multiple models with complementary strengths 
   may provide more robust assessments than relying on a single model.

Limitations and Future Directions
--------------------------------
This analysis has several limitations:

- The focus on English-language interactions may limit generalizability to 
  multilingual clinical settings.
- The specific rubric used may not capture all aspects of effective health 
  communication.
- The computational analysis of reasoning quality, while systematic, cannot 
  fully replace human expert judgment.

Future research should explore:
- Longitudinal stability of reasoning patterns
- Cross-cultural validation of assessment approaches
- Integration of human expert evaluation with computational analysis
- Development of adaptive assessment systems that adjust based on reasoning quality

Conclusion
----------
This comprehensive statistical analysis provides robust evidence for the complexity 
of LLM-based health communication assessment. The findings highlight the importance 
of considering multiple dimensions of model performance and suggest that optimal 
clinical assessment tools will require careful balance between consistency and 
reasoning quality.

The statistical rigor applied in this analysis provides a foundation for evidence-based 
selection of LLM models for clinical applications, moving beyond simple accuracy 
metrics to consider the quality and validity of the reasoning process itself.
