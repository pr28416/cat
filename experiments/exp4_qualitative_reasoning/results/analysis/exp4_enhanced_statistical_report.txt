EXPERIMENT 4: ENHANCED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS REPORT
============================================================
Generated: 2025-07-05 23:16:29

STATISTICAL TESTS PERFORMED
------------------------------
1. Chi-square test for evidence citation independence
2. Kruskal-Wallis test for rubric alignment differences
3. Mann-Whitney U tests for reasoning depth comparisons
4. Spearman correlations for consistency-reasoning relationships
5. Random Forest classification for multivariate patterns
6. Cohen's Kappa for inter-model agreement

KEY STATISTICAL FINDINGS
------------------------------
Evidence Citation: χ² = 37.3016, p = 0.000000
Effect Size (Cramér's V): 0.7052 (Large)
Significant: Yes

Rubric Alignment: H = 33.3184, p = 0.000001
Effect Size (η²): 0.4188 (Large)
Significant: Yes

Reasoning Depth: H = 10.5917, p = 0.031557
Significant: Yes

Model Classification Accuracy: 0.613 ± 0.078
Top Features: sentence_count, word_count, alignment_score

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
------------------------------
1. Significant differences in evidence citation patterns suggest models vary in validity
2. Large effect sizes indicate practical significance for clinical applications
3. Consistency-reasoning paradox: most consistent models may have poorest reasoning
4. Feature importance analysis guides model selection criteria
