# Experiment 5: Final Tool Validation

## Overview

This experiment represents the culmination of our systematic LLM optimization process, validating the final optimized tool configuration on a large, unseen dataset. Based on the results from Experiments 1-4, we test the optimal configuration identified through our rigorous experimental methodology.

## Optimized Configuration

Based on comprehensive analysis from previous experiments:

### Model Selection: GPT-4o-2024-08-06

**Rationale**:

- **Consistency**: Ranked 3rd in Experiment 3 (STDEV = 0.170)
- **Reasoning Quality**: Winner in Experiment 4 analysis
  - Perfect rubric alignment (100%)
  - Good evidence citation (26.7% direct quotes)
  - Balanced assessment approach
  - Appropriate response length (136 words average)
- **Clinical Suitability**: Optimal balance of consistency and explainability

### Prompt Strategy: Few-Shot

**Rationale**:

- **Winner from Experiment 2**: Lowest mean STDEV (0.194)
- **Theoretical Robustness**: Provides examples without over-complexity
- **Parsing Reliability**: 0% arithmetic errors vs 7.04% for Chain-of-Thought
- **Scalability**: Efficient for large-scale deployment

### Key Parameters

- **Temperature**: 0.1 (maximizing reproducibility)
- **Dataset**: Set C (250 transcripts for deeper analysis)
- **Attempts**: 20 per transcript (5,000 total assessments)
- **Rubric**: Patient Health Communication Rubric v5.0
- **Enhanced Features**: Smart API key management with rate limit handling

## Success Metrics (from PRD)

### Primary Benchmarks

1. **Mean STDEV < 1.0**: Total score standard deviation threshold
2. **95% Coverage**: Percentage of transcripts meeting consistency threshold
3. **Uncertainty Characterization**: Exploration of confidence patterns

### Secondary Metrics

- **Category-level consistency**: Individual rubric category performance
- **Score distribution analysis**: Range and patterns of assigned scores
- **Error rate**: Parsing and processing success rate

## Experimental Design

### Dataset: Set C

- **Size**: 250 transcripts (subset for deeper analysis)
- **Source**: Mixed DoVA and Nature paper transcripts
- **Status**: Completely unseen in Experiments 2-4
- **Partitioning**: Systematic random selection (seed: 12345)
- **Rationale**: Reduced scope allows for more attempts per transcript (20 vs 10)

### Validation Approach

- **Consistency-focused**: Primary emphasis on scoring reliability
- **Large-scale**: Comprehensive coverage of diverse transcript types
- **Uncertainty exploration**: Novel confidence quantification methods
- **Benchmark-driven**: Direct evaluation against PRD success criteria
