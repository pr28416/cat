## Overall Structure

5 categories, each scored 1 (Poor) to 4 (Excellent). Total score range: 5-20.

## Categories & Scoring Criteria

### Criterion 1: Clarity of Language

- **1 (Poor)**: Frequently unclear or provides irrelevant information; responses are difficult to understand or follow.
  - _Example: When asked about dietary habits, responds with, "I like food, but sometimes I don't eat it," without clarifying frequency or types of meals._
- **2 (Fair)**: Occasionally unclear or includes minor irrelevant information; some evidence of misunderstanding.
  - _Example: Describes dietary habits as "I eat healthy stuff like green things most days," without specifying foods or portions._
- **3 (Good)**: Generally clear and relevant; minor ambiguities that do not significantly hinder understanding.
  - _Example: States, "I usually eat vegetables and lean proteins, but I occasionally have snacks."_
- **4 (Excellent)**: Consistently clear, concise, and focused; responses are entirely relevant and easy to understand.
  - _Example: Explains, "I follow a balanced diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains daily, with an occasional treat once or twice a week."_

### Criterion 2: Lexical Diversity

- **1 (Poor)**: Very limited vocabulary; repetitive or overly simplistic; lacks ability to express nuanced ideas.
  - _Example: Repeatedly uses "good" to describe feelings and symptoms without elaboration._
- **2 (Fair)**: Basic vocabulary with frequent repetition; struggles to convey complex or specific information.
  - _Example: States, "I feel tired sometimes and other times not," without specifying frequency or context._
- **3 (Good)**: Moderate vocabulary; some variation; appropriate for context but may lack precise terminology.
  - _Example: Describes fatigue as "I feel tired after work, especially if I didn't sleep well the night before."_
- **4 (Excellent)**: Rich and varied vocabulary; uses precise and contextually appropriate terms to effectively communicate.
  - _Example: Explains, "I experience chronic fatigue, particularly in the evenings, which I attribute to insufficient rest and prolonged screen exposure."_

### Criterion 3: Conciseness and Completeness

- **1 (Poor)**: Response lacks critical information, leaving the core issue unclear or requiring significant prompting to clarify.
  - _Example: "My stomach hurts." Does not provide additional context, such as duration, triggers, or associated symptoms._
- **2 (Fair)**: Response includes some relevant details but misses key components or is vague, requiring follow-up questions.
  - _Example: "I get stomach pain after eating spicy food." Does not address frequency, severity, or mitigating factors._
- **3 (Good)**: Provides relevant information with minor omissions or occasional inclusion of extraneous details, but overall meaning is clear.
  - _Example: "I often feel stomach pain after eating spicy food, lasting a couple of hours." May not specify severity or exact triggers._
- **4 (Excellent)**: Response is comprehensive, including all critical details, with no unnecessary elaboration.
  - _Example: "I experience sharp stomach pain after eating spicy food, especially chili peppers, usually within 30 minutes. The pain lasts 2-3 hours and improves with antacids."_

### Criterion 4: Engagement with Health Information

- **1 (Poor)**: Responses are brief, lack detail, and show no active effort to engage with the topic. Appears disinterested or uninvested.
  - _Example: Provides one-word answers like, "Yes" or "No," when asked about symptoms, or says, "I don't know."_
- **2 (Fair)**: Responds adequately to questions but rarely provides additional details or context.
  - _Example: When asked about exercise habits, says, "I walk sometimes." Does not elaborate on frequency or duration._
- **3 (Good)**: Provides relevant and reasonably detailed answers, demonstrating interest and understanding but rarely initiates clarifications or adds supplementary information.
  - _Example: Says, "I walk about 3-4 times a week for 30 minutes." Responds well to questions but does not ask any._
- **4 (Excellent)**: Offers detailed, thoughtful responses, initiates clarification or supplementary information, and asks relevant questions to deepen understanding.
  - _Example: Explains, "I walk 3-4 times a week for about 30 minutes, usually after work. Should I increase the duration or add strength training for better results?"_

### Criterion 5: Health Literacy Indicator

- **1 (Poor)**: Lacks understanding of basic health concepts, frequently misinterprets questions.
  - _Example: Misunderstands the term "cholesterol" as exclusively related to weight rather than blood lipid levels._
- **2 (Fair)**: Limited understanding, may require simplification of health terms or further questioning to clarify answers.
  - _Example: Says, "I think cholesterol is bad, but I'm not sure what foods have it."_
- **3 (Good)**: Basic understanding, uses relevant health-related terms and describes symptoms appropriately.
  - _Example: States, "I'm trying to avoid high-cholesterol foods like fried items and red meat."_
- **4 (Excellent)**: Strong understanding of medical terminology and health context, with clear articulation of symptoms and health history.
  - _Example: Explains, "I limit my intake of foods high in LDL cholesterol, such as processed meats and fried foods, and focus on incorporating HDL-boosting items like nuts and avocados."_
