# Patient Health Communication Rubric v5.0

**Name:** "Patient Health Communication Rubric v5.0"
**Full Rubric Details:**
Overall Structure: 5 categories, each scored 1 (Poor) to 4 (Excellent). Total score range: 5-20.
Categories & Scoring Criteria:

- **Criterion 1: Clarity of Language**
  - 1 (Poor): Frequently unclear or provides irrelevant information; responses are difficult to understand or follow. Example: When asked about dietary habits, responds with, "I like food, but sometimes I don't eat it," without clarifying frequency or types of meals.
  - 2 (Fair): Occasionally unclear or includes minor irrelevant information; some evidence of misunderstanding. Example: Describes dietary habits as "I eat healthy stuff like green things most days," without specifying foods or portions.
  - 3 (Good): Generally clear and relevant; minor ambiguities that do not significantly hinder understanding. Example: States, "I usually eat vegetables and lean proteins, but I occasionally have snacks."
  - 4 (Excellent): Consistently clear, concise, and focused; responses are entirely relevant and easy to understand. Example: Explains, "I follow a balanced diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains daily, with an occasional treat once or twice a week."
- **Criterion 2: Lexical Diversity**
  - 1 (Poor): Very limited vocabulary; repetitive or overly simplistic; lacks ability to express nuanced ideas. Example: Repeatedly uses "good" to describe feelings and symptoms without elaboration.
  - 2 (Fair): Basic vocabulary with frequent repetition; struggles to convey complex or specific information. Example: States, "I feel tired sometimes and other times not," without specifying frequency or context.
  - 3 (Good): Moderate vocabulary; some variation; appropriate for context but may lack precise terminology. Example: Describes fatigue as "I feel tired after work, especially if I didn't sleep well the night before."
  - 4 (Excellent): Rich and varied vocabulary; uses precise and contextually appropriate terms to effectively communicate. Example: Explains, "I experience chronic fatigue, particularly in the evenings, which I attribute to insufficient rest and prolonged screen exposure."
- **Criterion 3: Conciseness and Completeness**
  - 1 (Poor): Response lacks critical information, leaving the core issue unclear or requiring significant prompting to clarify. Example: "My stomach hurts." Does not provide additional context, such as duration, triggers, or associated symptoms.
  - 2 (Fair): Response includes some relevant details but misses key components or is vague, requiring follow-up questions. Example: "I get stomach pain after eating spicy food." Does not address frequency, severity, or mitigating factors.
  - 3 (Good): Provides relevant information with minor omissions or occasional inclusion of extraneous details, but overall meaning is clear. Example: "I often feel stomach pain after eating spicy food, lasting a couple of hours." May not specify severity or exact triggers.
  - 4 (Excellent): Response is comprehensive, including all critical details, with no unnecessary elaboration. Example: "I experience sharp stomach pain after eating spicy food, especially chili peppers, usually within 30 minutes. The pain lasts 2-3 hours and improves with antacids."
- **Criterion 4: Engagement with Health Information**
  - 1 (Poor): Responses are brief, lack detail, and show no active effort to engage with the topic. Appears disinterested or uninvested. Example: Provides one-word answers like, "Yes" or "No," when asked about symptoms, or says, "I don't know."
  - 2 (Fair): Responds adequately to questions but rarely provides additional details or context. Example: When asked about exercise habits, says, "I walk sometimes." Does not elaborate on frequency or duration.
  - 3 (Good): Provides relevant and reasonably detailed answers, demonstrating interest and understanding but rarely initiates clarifications or adds supplementary information. Example: Says, "I walk about 3-4 times a week for 30 minutes." Responds well to questions but does not ask any.
  - 4 (Excellent): Offers detailed, thoughtful responses, initiates clarification or supplementary information, and asks relevant questions to deepen understanding. Example: Explains, "I walk 3-4 times a week for about 30 minutes, usually after work. Should I increase the duration or add strength training for better results?"
- **Criterion 5: Health Literacy Indicator**
  - 1 (Poor): Lacks understanding of basic health concepts, frequently misinterprets questions. Example: Misunderstands the term "cholesterol" as exclusively related to weight rather than blood lipid levels.
  - 2 (Fair): Limited understanding, may require simplification of health terms or further questioning to clarify answers. Example: Says, "I think cholesterol is bad, but I'm not sure what foods have it."
  - 3 (Good): Basic understanding, uses relevant health-related terms and describes symptoms appropriately. Example: States, "I'm trying to avoid high-cholesterol foods like fried items and red meat."
  - 4 (Excellent): Strong understanding of medical terminology and health context, with clear articulation of symptoms and health history. Example: Explains, "I limit my intake of foods high in LDL cholesterol, such as processed meats and fried foods, and focus on incorporating HDL-boosting items like nuts and avocados."

**Statement of Finality:** This "Patient Health Communication Rubric v5.0" is considered final and will remain constant for all experiments detailed in this PRD to ensure comparability of results.
