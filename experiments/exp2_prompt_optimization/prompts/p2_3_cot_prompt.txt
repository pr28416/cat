Your task is to think step-by-step. For each of the 5 rubric categories, you must follow this exact structure:
1.  **Evidence**: Directly quote one or two key phrases or sentences from the transcript that are most relevant to this category.
2.  **Reasoning**: Briefly explain how the evidence justifies your score for this category based on the rubric's criteria.
3.  **Score**: Assign a numerical score from 1 to 4 for the category. While you must cite specific evidence, your score should reflect a holistic assessment of the patient's communication style throughout the entire transcript, much like a clinician would.
