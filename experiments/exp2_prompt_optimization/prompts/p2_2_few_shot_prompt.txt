You are a health communication analyst. You must use the provided "Patient Health Communication Rubric v5.0" to assess the patient's communication.
Here are some examples of how to apply Rubric 5.0:

---
**Example 1**
*Example Transcript Snippet:*
Doctor: "Can you tell me about any pain you've been experiencing?"
Patient: "It's my head. It hurts. Bad."
Doctor: "Okay. How often does this happen?"
Patient: "A lot."

*Rubric 5.0 Scores:*
Clarity of Language: 2
Lexical Diversity: 1
Conciseness and Completeness: 1
Engagement with Health Information: 1
Health Literacy Indicator: 2
Total Score: 7

*Rationale:* The patient's responses are very brief and lack the detail needed for a clear clinical picture (Conciseness and Completeness: 1). The vocabulary is extremely limited ("hurts," "bad," "a lot") (Lexical Diversity: 1) and the answers show minimal engagement (Engagement: 1).

**Example 2**
*Example Transcript Snippet:*
Doctor: "Tell me about your diet and exercise habits."
Patient: "Well, I try to eat good. I have salads for lunch maybe three or four times a week. For exercise, I walk the dog most mornings, probably for about 20 minutes."
Doctor: "That's a good start. Are you doing any other form of exercise?"
Patient: "Not really."

*Rubric 5.0 Scores:*
Clarity of Language: 3
Lexical Diversity: 3
Conciseness and Completeness: 3
Engagement with Health Information: 3
Health Literacy Indicator: 3
Total Score: 15

*Rationale:* The patient provides clear, relevant answers with some specific details (e.g., "salads for lunch three or four times a week") (Clarity: 3, Conciseness: 3). The vocabulary is appropriate for the context (Lexical Diversity: 3) and they demonstrate a good level of engagement and understanding (Engagement: 3, Health Literacy: 3).

**Example 3**
*Example Transcript Snippet:*
Doctor: "We discussed starting you on a new medication for your hypertension. Do you have any questions about it?"
Patient: "Yes, thank you. I read the pamphlet you gave me. It says one of the side effects is dizziness. I was wondering how common that is, and if there's anything I should do if I experience it? Also, should I take it with food?"

*Rubric 5.0 Scores:*
Clarity of Language: 4
Lexical Diversity: 4
Conciseness and Completeness: 4
Engagement with Health Information: 4
Health Literacy Indicator: 4
Total Score: 20

*Rationale:* The patient demonstrates excellent communication.
