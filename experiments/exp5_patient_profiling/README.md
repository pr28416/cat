# Experiment 5: Patient Communication Profiling

## Overview

This experiment explores the capability of LLMs to generate comprehensive patient communication profiles beyond numerical scores, providing actionable insights for healthcare providers.

## Approach

1. Design a structured profiling template for patient communication
2. Create prompts that generate detailed qualitative assessments in addition to numeric scores
3. Generate profiles from both real and synthetic transcripts
4. Evaluate the clinical utility and accuracy of the generated profiles

## Implementation
