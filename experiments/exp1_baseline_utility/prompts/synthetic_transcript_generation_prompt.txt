You are tasked with generating a synthetic patient-doctor dialogue transcript. The goal is to model the PATIENT's communication skills, which should be designed to achieve the following target scores when evaluated using the rubric below:

- Clarity of Language: {{Target_Clarity_of_Language}}
- Lexical Diversity: {{Target_Lexical_Diversity}}
- Conciseness and Completeness: {{Target_Conciseness_and_Completeness}}
- Engagement with Health Information: {{Target_Engagement_with_Health_Information}}
- Health Literacy Indicator: {{Target_Health_Literacy_Indicator}}
- **Target Total Score: {{TTS}}**

{{RubricV5Text}}

Guidelines for generating the PATIENT's {{QualityLevel}} quality communication:
- For a 'low' quality transcript, the patient should exhibit communication barriers, limited engagement, and poor information exchange.
- For a 'medium' quality transcript, the patient should show a mix of effective communication and areas for improvement, with moderate engagement.
- For a 'high' quality transcript, the patient should demonstrate excellent communication, strong engagement, and clear, empathetic responses.

**Style and Length Guidelines (Very Important):**

1.  **Length and Pacing**: Create a substantial transcript of **50-100 conversational turns**. A "turn" is a single block of speech from one person. Focus on a natural, rapid back-and-forth exchange rather than long monologues.

2.  **Realistic, Unscripted Feel**: The dialogue must feel like a real, unscripted human conversation. This means including:
    *   **Backchanneling**: The listener (especially the doctor) should use short, natural interjections like "Uh-huh," "Okay," "Right," and "I see" to show they are engaged.
    *   **Interruptions & Overlap**: It's okay for speakers to gently interrupt or finish each other's sentences.

3.  **Example of Desired Style**:
    ```
    DOCTOR: So a couple of things um, looks like your pressure's a little bit high.
    PATIENT: Yeah that might be from, you know I woke up this morning with the intentions of doing other things.
    DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
    PATIENT: And then it dawned on me that I had a doctor's appointment like around 7:30.
    DOCTOR: Uh-huh okay.
    ```

**Final Instructions:**

1.  **The DOCTOR's communication must always be a model of excellence**: clear, professional, empathetic, and patient-centered (effectively a "4 out of 4" on all rubric categories). The patient's communication is the only variable being manipulated.
2.  Generate ONLY the transcript itself. Do not include explanations, notes, or the rubric text in your final response.
3.  Start your response with "Transcript:" and ensure the dialogue follows.
4.  Format the dialogue with "DOCTOR:" and "PATIENT:" prefixes.
5.  Make the conversation natural and realistic, ensuring the **patient's** communication quality subtly reflects the target subscores.
6.  Do not explicitly mention the rubric categories or scores in the generated dialogue.
