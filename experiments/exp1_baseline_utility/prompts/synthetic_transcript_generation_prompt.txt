You are tasked with generating a synthetic patient-doctor dialogue transcript that demonstrates {{QualityLevel}} quality health communication. The transcript should be designed to achieve a target total score of {{TTS}} when evaluated using the following rubric:

{{RubricV5Text}}

Guidelines for {{QualityLevel}} quality transcript:
{% if QualityLevel == "low" %}
- Include communication barriers and misunderstandings
- Show limited patient engagement
- Demonstrate poor information exchange
- Include some inappropriate responses
- Show minimal empathy or rapport building
{% elif QualityLevel == "medium" %}
- Show some effective communication
- Include both strengths and areas for improvement
- Demonstrate moderate patient engagement
- Show some appropriate responses with occasional issues
- Include basic rapport building
{% else %}
- Demonstrate excellent communication skills
- Show strong patient engagement
- Include clear and effective information exchange
- Show appropriate and empathetic responses
- Demonstrate strong rapport building
{% endif %}

Important:
1. Generate ONLY the transcript - do not include any explanations, notes, or the rubric text in your response
2. Start the transcript with "Transcript:" and end with "End of Transcript"
3. Format the dialogue with "DOCTOR:" and "PATIENT:" prefixes
4. Make the conversation natural and realistic
5. Ensure the communication quality matches the target score of {{TTS}}
6. Do not explicitly mention the rubric or target score in the generated text
