DOCTOR: Yeah for sure. And are you and your girlfriend in an exclusive relationship?
PATIENT: Uh. I I think so yeah.
DOCTOR: OK, I ask because there's something called what you may be familiar with um it's called the kissing disease. In medical terminology, it's called mono, as caused by a virus called EBV, and so it could be that so we're covering all our bases.
PATIENT: Oh, I've heard of mono before.
DOCTOR: Yeah,
PATIENT: OK.
DOCTOR: It's it's likely it could be up there in terms of what you have, so I think those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions for me? Anything you wanted to add?
PATIENT: Um, no, I think that's you covered everything.
DOCTOR: OK alright so I will will go off a few, we'll try to cover our basis and get you tested for mono which I would have to do like a monospot test and we can do rapid strep test as well to see if he has something called strep throat. But yeah, we'll see what those results come back as. And we'll go from there. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, no, that sounds good.
DOCTOR: OK, thank you.
