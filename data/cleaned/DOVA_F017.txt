DOCTOR: PATIENT?  How you doing sir?  Pleased to meet you.  You normally see DOCTOR?
PATIENT: I haven't seen my regular doctor for probably about six or seven months.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh actually I was in the Emergency Room a couple weeks ago with um pain in my arms and my chest and uh now I notice that I'm having uh bouts of headaches along with continued limb pain and some chest pain and uh a lot of coughing.
DOCTOR: Okay what's the number one complaint, the arm pain?
PATIENT: Yeah the arm pain.
DOCTOR: And uh why haven't you seen the regular doctor?
PATIENT: I haven't been.
DOCTOR: They didn't schedule you or anything.
PATIENT: Something like that.
DOCTOR: Um.  Now you tell me you were in the ER and they wanted you to be admitted.
PATIENT: Yeah and I uh.  When I went there the problem had been going on for about three days but after I was in the Emergency I wasn't experiencing that same problem so I didn't feel like I could stay in the hospital for something that I didn't feel like it was a problem at the time.
DOCTOR: So who was your main doctor before?
PATIENT: I couldn't even tell you sir.  It just seems like every year I get a new doctor.  I get seen by them once or twice and then I get another new one.
DOCTOR: Have you been taking your medications?
PATIENT: The ones that I can get.  I have run out of clopidogrel.  I have no more prescriptions available for metoprolol and I'm down to my last, I have no more refills for my glipizide and only one refill remaining for my metformin and just keeping up with what I'm taking it's just impossible trying to do this online and order.  No names, just numbers.
DOCTOR: Are you getting any chest pain right now?
PATIENT: Not at this moment no.
DOCTOR: Um so you have left arm pain.  How long has the left arm pain been going on?
PATIENT: Oh totally for about a month, maybe six weeks.
DOCTOR: Uh is it worse when you use it?
PATIENT: It's just, it feels like it's under the skin, maybe in the veins and it has nothing to do with using the arm or not.
DOCTOR: Any rash?
PATIENT: None noticed.
DOCTOR: Have you injured your arm in any way?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Is it worse if you get up, if you're walking around, you're doing a flight of stairs or something?
PATIENT: It's not always in the arm.  Sometimes I just feel you know just short of breath, just general walking.  I'm in sales so I don't do a lot.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  How much activity, do you ever go up the stairs at all, like uh?
PATIENT: Not really.
DOCTOR: Okay um and you don't walk much?  Have you walked into?  How did you get here, did you walk from the parking lot?
PATIENT: From the parking lot yeah.
DOCTOR: So walking from the parking lot here, did you get short of breath?
PATIENT: I didn't park that far away, I was pretty close.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you do housework at all?
PATIENT: On occasion.
DOCTOR: Do you get short of breath with that?
PATIENT: I haven't done any housework lately.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I haven't done anything to exert myself, only just walking on the lot to find a car.
DOCTOR: Okay when you've had chest pain, can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: I want to say you know like a quick stabbing or pressure uh.  Like someone pushing on my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay how long does it last?
PATIENT: Seconds.
DOCTOR: Where is it worse, where is it?
PATIENT: It's usually in the left side.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When was the last time you took Plavix?
PATIENT: What's Plavix?
DOCTOR: I mean clopidogrel?
PATIENT: Uh two days ago, I ran out.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Now are you using the insulin?
PATIENT: Yes.  I'm up to 18 units per day.
DOCTOR: Simvastatin?
PATIENT: Simvastatin I don't know about that.
DOCTOR: It's a cholesterol medication.
PATIENT: I'm not sure if it's required, I'm not missing any of my meds.  Maybe my night medication, just because I'm so tired when I come from work, I just get home and pass out rather than taking more medicine.
DOCTOR: Are you still smoking or no?
PATIENT: No I haven't smoked in almost two years, that's why I'm complaining about the cough.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How long have you been coughing?
PATIENT: Uh only about three months.  That's actually one thing my wife thinks that we should find out what that is and it doesn't matter whether I'm at work or whether I'm at home, I get really severe coughing from time to time.
DOCTOR: Did you eat anything this morning?
PATIENT: Not yet, usually about 10 o'clock is when I have breakfast.
DOCTOR: Do you want to pick up these medications today or have them sent to you?
PATIENT: Uh the ones I run out, I especially need to pick up.
DOCTOR: Are you still taking the iron?
PATIENT: Yes I have taken it. I take it.
DOCTOR: How about the doxazosin?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Are you having much urinary trouble?
PATIENT: I'm still going frequently at night.
DOCTOR: And what were the ones that you need today?  I'm sorry, the Plavix or the clopidogrel.
PATIENT: And glipizide.  I probably got about two weeks left and metoprolol uh; I don't have any more prescriptions available for that.  I've probably got about a week's worth left.
DOCTOR: What have your sugars been running?
PATIENT: Last time I did take the time to check they were in the high 100s, like almost 200.
DOCTOR: Have you been getting low at all?
PATIENT: Yeah a few times it's gotten low.
DOCTOR: How long have you been taking the insulin?
PATIENT: Three months maybe.
DOCTOR: You started it when?
PATIENT: Last um, the doctor I saw last time.  She actually had me seen in the diabetes educator a couple times.  So there may be notes in there from her.
DOCTOR: Are you still smoking?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Have you tried hydrochlorothiazide in the past?
PATIENT: I can't remember what it is.
DOCTOR: It's a medication for blood pressure.
PATIENT: I've only taken lisinopril for blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you been checking your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  Alright.  I'm going to increase the lisinopril to 40 and start you on a medication; well I'll probably start you on another one, the hydrochlorothiazide.  Okay and I also want you to see the cardiologist again um.  I don't think that chest pain sounds terribly cardiogenic but um shortness of breath is a little more concerning.  You know you had a positive stress test in the past and you know sometimes we can do an angiogram.  Um have you ever had an angiogram before?  They go in through the groin to take a look at the heart vessels.
PATIENT: I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You want to sit up there.  Well you know, I think we want to make sure you know you're not having any major um, increased blockage in the heart.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Now I think last time they thought that was unlikely based on the stress test um but you may, they may need to do an angiogram.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay because of your diabetes and if there was a major blockage and you needed to undergo you know good severe disease then they may need to maybe either put a stent in or.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do a bypass.  I don't think right now you're not getting anything acute.  I don't think you're having a heart attack or anything like that but there could be a little bit of angina.  Um so I think you should be seen by them again.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You've only seen them once is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes just once.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Take some deep breaths.  Any sores on your legs, concerns about your feet or anything like that?
PATIENT: Not on the feet.  I banged my leg a few days ago and just seems to be taking a longer time than normal to heal.
DOCTOR: Okay if it doesn't look worse than that, if it starts, you know if it doesn't heal in a week or so then let us know okay.  [REDACTED] up alright.  Um any stomach pain when I press?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright uh I think we'll put you in the morning.  We can't determine, so we could, uh, we can't do labs up here so you just sit in here and I'll say to follow up with me and I know you saw DOCTOR once, but I think DOCTOR was your primary.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Alright you can sit in the chair.
(DOCTOR OUT:  44:12  DOCTOR IN:  59:06)
DOCTOR: Alright uh so you know you've been talking for three months.  I just need to ask you a little bit more about that.  I've got to write down the other stuff.  Is it a dry cough or?
PATIENT: Yeah mostly it's dry and eventually I get some phlegm up.
DOCTOR: You do okay.  So I want to do a chest x-ray today um and then um you know the medication you're on, the lisinopril.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That can cause a cough.  I mean and uh it can happen any time.
PATIENT: Okay cause I haven't been quit smoking for almost two years now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And almost immediately after I stopped smoking I started having the cough until recently at sometimes.
DOCTOR: Do have any runny nose or?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It could also be postnasal drip from allergies okay.  Where everything comes down.  You say your nose has been stuffy and draining?  Okay well we can try that too um there's medications for it okay.  So I'm going to give you this nasal, there's a nasal inhaler.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um it's called Flonase.
PATIENT: Yes I've taken that before.
DOCTOR: When have you taken it?
PATIENT: Uh years ago.
DOCTOR: Well I think it could help.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we'll get a chest x-ray today.  Uh you can get labs done while youâ€™re here, okay.  And then let me see your arms, the left arm.  Have you been taking anything for this?
PATIENT: No I try to avoid taking over-the-counter meds.
DOCTOR: I think you can try some Tylenol.  Where does the pain go.
PATIENT: Usually it's just going through the muscle and it feels like it's just under the skin.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Does it hurt when I press on that?
PATIENT: Not really.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh well you know usually these things are musculoskeletal and benign.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh I think you should try some Tylenol first and maybe do some ice to it and uh see what that; you could just do just over-the-counter Tylenol; it's cheaper if you buy it.
PATIENT: I'm a internal bleeder.
DOCTOR: Yeah Tylenol is safe.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: From that standpoint so you know don't take it more than like four times a day though.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um and then they did a chest x-ray in the ER when you were there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But uh they only did the one view with the portable machine.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I mean those aren't the best x-rays, especially for us so we'll get a real one and have you go down and get it after you, whichever line is shorter, you can get them both done today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: So you want some lab work and x-rays right?
DOCTOR: Yes and then I'll take care of the meds.  We're going to switch you on a different, I'm going to take you off that lisinopril and put you on something else.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: A similar medication that doesnâ€™t cause the cough in case that's what's doing it.  Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright um and I want you to come back like in three months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you can see me and I put a note in for the cardiologist to see you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so that should be scheduled, if not, if they don't get hold of you in a week or so give them a call.  Cause definitely I want you to see them.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause you know you may need an angiogram.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um okay.
PATIENT: Okay doc.
DOCTOR: Alright take care.
PATIENT: 63:05
Time is 10 o'clock a.m.
