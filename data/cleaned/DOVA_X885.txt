DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: How are you?
DOCTOR: Good.  How are you?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's raining out there [REDACTED].
PATIENT: A little.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah have a seat here; it rolls off the back huh.  So how are you doing today?
PATIENT: I'm here.
DOCTOR: You're here.  What can I do for you today?  Just checking in after all of your you know stuff that's been going on?  Do you have specific things you wanted to talk about today?
PATIENT: Oh I have a couple.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Let’s start with those?
PATIENT: There has been very infrequent times in which I would get a lightning bolt of a pain in my temple, my left temple.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it is so hard and so fast that it will cause me to do “aakk”.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then uh one or two times it'll come [REDACTED] start to dissipate.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So um.
DOCTOR: How, you said very infrequent, how many times are we talking here?
PATIENT: The last one was two weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Two weeks ago okay and then prior to that?
PATIENT: Uh probably, I don't know I wasn't really keeping track.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh within the month previously.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But it's unusual to get them.  They're so hard and they're so intense and they hurt a lot, the last time I had one I was in shower, it caused my wife to come running in because.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Of uh but, so I don't know if that means anything or not.
DOCTOR: How long do they typically last when you do get them?
PATIENT: Seconds.
DOCTOR: Seconds okay.
PATIENT: But you don’t forget them.
DOCTOR: Yeah and then when it does happen on the days when it does happen do they come and go and you just have the one or during that day if you have you could have a few?
PATIENT: During the day if I have one, I could have two, maybe once I had three but not more than three.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It dissipates within minutes?
PATIENT: Minutes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Give me one second; I got a couple more questions about that.
PATIENT: Oh okay [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Huh.  And now when was the first episode you remember having of this type of thing?
PATIENT: Of this type?  Uh late last fall 2011.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Very late.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay and do you have any other symptoms at the time, like visual changes um weakness, numbness um, losing balance, vomiting, nausea, any other symptoms?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  No nausea, no vomiting uh, I probably lose my balance a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Actually I just can't move [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's painful yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay um and so no visual changes?
PATIENT: Uh my eyes are squeezed shut.
DOCTOR: Are you sensitive to the light when it happens?  Does the light hurt your eyes or do you just close them from the pain?
PATIENT: No, I close them for the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.  Next.
PATIENT: Okay.  Well I'm doing really well.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
PATIENT: In Rehab.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  I see that.  [REDACTED] You are last there, it’s supposed to be 11.
PATIENT: Yeah but I do really well.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they'll tell you that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah I can see that in all of their notes, they say it.
PATIENT: Okay.  But the strain is, strengthening is that if I walk two blocks outside I'm out of breath.
DOCTOR: Hmm okay.
PATIENT: How do you explain that?  I can go on the treadmill for 20 minutes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: At a big incline and at a quick speed.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay and I'm outside and I walk two blocks and I'm out of breath.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Hmm.
PATIENT: So and here's another thing is that um even if I go up a flight of stairs in my house.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: A lot of times, not infrequently, but a lot of times when I get to the top I have to stop.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'm out of breath and my legs are burning.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And if I go up two flights.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And [REDACTED] to the top.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then, I’m always out of breath.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So that's really strange for not [REDACTED] in Rehab.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  One thing that about the stairs and I know you were telling me is how severe the shortness of breath is but.
PATIENT: It’s severe.
DOCTOR: The difference when you're doing rehab normally there's a little bit of a like work-up, like a warm-up type of.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I mean you get into it a little bit and you know even like people like myself if I walk up a flight of stairs and I've been sitting all day long you know I breathe just kind of heavily when you first do that and sometimes if you're kind of sitting at rest but then you go do some activity like walking up the stairs you'll be short of breath that seems a little bit out of proportion but I'm just trying to balance.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Cause you obviously, you have cardiac problems, um if that's what we think is going on, if it’s just your body's kind of catching up to you when you do that because you haven't kind of eased into it like you do with the rehab or you know what that is so, let me think on that a little bit.
PATIENT: Okay.  A thought process.
DOCTOR: Yeah and I mean the question is, you've had ever since your surgery and all that stuff, you've had all of these tests and everything looked.
PATIENT: Great.
DOCTOR: Great and so it's very reassuring and fantastic, frustrating when you're still having symptoms.
PATIENT: Well and it's frustrating one time [REDACTED].  When I was in Building 2.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I was [REDACTED] Amvets.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I try to walk in and started my [REDACTED] taking [REDACTED] and she said we're not talking.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I remember that, she thought that you weren't doing well and took you to the Emergency Room.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I remember that and then all of the tests you were sent to get in the hospital.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED] tests.
DOCTOR: Right all that stuff so, we'll think on it a little bit here okay.
PATIENT: Okay now um, did you see what they did with Agent Orange over the last few weeks?
DOCTOR: I saw that, I've been looking at it – some extra paperwork that showed up that was confusing but it turned out it's not going to be.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Not necessarily a mistake that you ended up getting your [REDACTED].  Well then there was some A&A Claim, that was a mistake.
PATIENT: Yeah, correct, correct.
DOCTOR: And that was.
PATIENT: The social worker straightened it out.
DOCTOR: Right the social worker took care of that.  What else is, I don't know anything else that's going on [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.  Uh I'm just worried about this.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay um originally, I was here in the hospital for a while who knew what the fast-track system was.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
PATIENT: Nobody else here has really seemed [REDACTED] I went up to the Director’s office.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I went to the [REDACTED] and that’s not very good.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah.
PATIENT: I went all over.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: If that was new what it was.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay, at that time, which was very recent, fast track consisted of three primary emphasis.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: With Agent Orange.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Parkinson's, ischemia and leukemia.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay um in the last two or three weeks.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I’ll pinpoint it later.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It jumped.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: From 3 to 8.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.
PATIENT: So does that mean I'm susceptible to [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: It used to be only 3 forever.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: And I got the original letter.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: From the idiots they have at the VA.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] and again they don't talk about the 3.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So I mean I think probably what they did because the three you said were what ischemia, Parkinson's and leukemia?
PATIENT: Leukemia.
DOCTOR: So these extra diseases that are on here like they [REDACTED] ischemia, [REDACTED] of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's and multiple myeloma, those are all sort of.
PATIENT: Deviations.
DOCTOR: Similar like, you know it may be a different title.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And a little bit of difference in the disease process but pretty similar and probably what's happened is that the medical knowledge about those conditions has expanded from what were maybe in the past but all of these have been clumped in the same thing but many now the knowledge is a little bit better so.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Okay.
DOCTOR: I think it's something just to be aware of but.
PATIENT: I want to be aware of it because after the lawsuit was won in 2010.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then this is [REDACTED] extra paper then.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it says if you look at the Vietnam veteran population.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The decisions we contracted.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And the mortality rate, the only people dying faster is a World War II Veterans and so we were picking up diseases by our 60s that we shouldn't be getting until late 70s and early 80s.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And so if I have a shorten lifespan.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then I’ll want to know about it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I'll have some things I need do.
DOCTOR: Yeah well, so knowledge is power and knowing, knowing those types of things are associated with Agent Orange is always a good thing.
PATIENT: So I should really be tested don't you think?
DOCTOR: I think.
PATIENT: So how do you test fr that?
DOCTOR: So the thing with those is, is that there's not specific, there's not like a test like for diabetes when you can check your sugars and then you know and so the thing for those types of things is good primary care medicine.  Getting your annual you know blood checks done.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: You know keeping an eye on you know symptoms like if you do have things you know come up and watching for any, most of our veterans need to lose weight and you know and are actively working on losing weight.  But worrisome things like unexplained, large amounts of unexplained weight loss, where someone hasn't been trying and the weight’s just falls off of them.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Those types of things are concerning you know, signs and symptoms of these types of diseases but what you have done is you get a blood check, you get your what we call your CBC which is your blood counts checked, you come in on a regular basis to be seen by providers, so that's really the best testing for those particular diseases.  There's not a lab test you know that we can draw the blood and check for, except for your regular blood cell count, which is what you already get done.  So I would say for those conditions you're doing what you need to do with just having your regular annual, bi-annual appointments.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Uh it makes sense uh, it doesn’t give me any comfort, though.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I run into too many people get where they all of a sudden go really bad, really fast.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh then DOCTOR [REDACTED] Saturday night.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Did you see this?  He says don't go riding a bike for the first few days.
DOCTOR: Okay, [REDACTED] okay.  Saturday night is when you started?
PATIENT: Yeah and then we decided that we would start off instead of twice a day let's just do it at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Today was the first day I took it in the morning and at night.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because in rehab there are three nurses and a doctor.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: And that's make you nervous or?
PATIENT: I just want to be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um now I think about the pills.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I think we're on the right pill.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  I think so, we can go through the medicines and get uh, I'll just take a quick, hold on a second for me.  Yeah I don't really see anything sort of questionable.
PATIENT: Oh that's good.
DOCTOR: I mean you know, extra, really.  So you know I think you're right in your assessment of your medicines.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think they are all good medicines for good things.
PATIENT: And um I'm more tired than I used to be in life.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Well you have had a lot of you know heart issues in you know this year, this sort of calendar year.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And some significant hospital stays and they find that you know just being in the hospital you need at a bare minimum of three days to almost a week for every one day you're in the hospital to fully recover.  So some of these big surgeries that you had and things like that, they say it can take a full year before you really feel like your energy is back to where you were before because it's so stressful on the body and such a drain on, you know on your system itself.  Let me just check this um, one thing and then um so I'm not, I'm not surprised.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That you tell me that you're a little bit, lower energy than you.
PATIENT: If you're not knocked up [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay and then what I was looking at to see if your thyroid function has been tested in the last you know year or so and it has been and it was normal in October and it's a, if by you know late summer you're still not feeling a little bit you know.
PATIENT: Spunkier?.
DOCTOR: Spunkier, we can recheck that again and make sure you know your thyroid's still doing okay and things like that but it was checked in a very appropriate time frame here and it was normal.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: You've had a lot of stress on your body this year in addition to this mental stress and everything and that can wear you down and make you feel a little bit.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Lower energy.
PATIENT: That's what the psychiatrist/psychologist is working on.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: My case is unusual in that my stress goes back to childhood.
DOCTOR: Yeah uh-huh.
PATIENT: And pent up for years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I think maybe it was a incorpiration during the war.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I father/son of the year, period.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I remember you saying that.
PATIENT: Oh.  Then I had two more questions.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, I have, I just want to make sure that the sock guy [REDACTED] toes and they were gonna cut it off and basically because I stubbed my toe and I @@.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I can take a look at it.  What was your other question besides looking at the toe?
PATIENT: Okay, I don't know if you can answer this.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But uh, I haven't had uh intercourse for two years.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now hopefully someday in time.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh I'm going to want to have intercourse okay.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now one medication that DOCTOR gave me [REDACTED] erection [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So once in a while [REDACTED] I have one but it goes away [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay and that's fine.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But um, in order to see if I can um uh, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I tried having sex with myself and it was terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And um.
DOCTOR: So not able to achieve an erection or maintaining?
PATIENT: I achieved a very weak erection.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then it bled on the head.
DOCTOR: Okay, hmm.
PATIENT: So um I don't know if that's just, Arnold Schwarzenegger once said on one of the nighttime talk shows.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh they asked him about muscles and making love and he said, yes, that’s a muscle, you exercise it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know so that's the question I have, I don't know if you have the answer.
DOCTOR: Was the blood on the skin or was it from the meatus, from the hole?
PATIENT: No it was on the skin.
DOCTOR: On the skin.
PATIENT: It wasn't from the hole.
DOCTOR: And are you circumcised or uncircumcised?
PATIENT: I'm circumcised.
DOCTOR: Circumcised okay, okay.  Um was there any pulling or tearing that you, you know friction?
PATIENT: Yeah there was friction because I was trying so hard.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah.
PATIENT: And uh it was [REDACTED] and that was like weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So you do you think its lack of desire, lack of drive or this drive but inability to maintain and erection?
PATIENT: I think right now its lack of desire.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And so therefore I only get a partial.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then I try to get it to work.
DOCTOR: And that's probably, part of the whole thing; I think there's a few things going on here.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Um one thing is the anti-depressants.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: The venlafaxine and those types of medicines.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Can make it difficult to achieve an erection.  They can affect sexual performance.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So there's probably a component of medication induced issues with erections and that can happen.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: There's probably a stress or anxiety component related to it meaning that you know you want it to work and then if things aren't going in the right direct then there's like more anxiety.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: And that kind of works against you as you're you know kind of get ramped up and then [REDACTED] works in the opposite direction as far as what you're trying to achieve.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And then finally there may be a component of cardiovascular problems that are leading to trouble with erections as well.  So we know you have significant heart disease.
PATIENT: Heart yeah okay.
DOCTOR: You know you have significant coronary artery disease and those blood vessels are the same as all the other blood vessels in your body so if you have issues you know with your heart then you can have issues with getting and sustaining an erection as well and the best way to manage that is to treat, you know like we're doing, to maintain your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Under control, get your cholesterol well controlled, diet and exercise, which are all things we're already working on.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And you're going in the right direction with that so I think probably in the long term, as you continue with your exercise and increasing you know your capacity and um you know continue with the statins and the medicines, in the long term I think probably.
PATIENT: It'll help the problems.
DOCTOR: Yeah it may work, it may work itself out and if it doesn't the most likely culprit is most likely like the venlafaxine medicine um and at that time if there's a problem at that time some of the other medicines may have a lesser affect on libido and ability to sustain an erection so at that time that conversation could be had.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If everything else is kind of improved.
PATIENT: Okay I [REDACTED] desire at all.
DOCTOR: No, right, right.
PATIENT: But uh.
DOCTOR: So I.
PATIENT: It just happened a few weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I thought okay, let’s just see.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: Yeah and it sounds to me like the bleeding was more of a friction issue and so you may want to try like a lubricant or a lotion or something like that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: To help kind of prevent the friction going there.
PATIENT: I don’t really have an overwhelming desire to do it.
DOCTOR: Right so I think there are a few things probably going on all at once.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you know kind of working itself you know in the wrong direction.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Before you're there but I think there’s progress to be made by doing the things you're doing already to help improve your heart function and your cardiovascular function and things like that okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Sounds reasonable, sound fine.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So let me take a look at your toe, why don't you hop up here for me.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um your blood pressure's great today, your pulse is great.
PATIENT: It always is.
DOCTOR: And your weight is looking good.  Let's see where you have over here, so let's see, you were.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm just trying to look and see where your last were with your weight, so in November it looks like you were about 170.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Does that sound right to you?
PATIENT: Yeah 167-170.
DOCTOR: Okay and now you're like 187 is what we're getting here today and the last [REDACTED] you're down from 190 a few weeks ago.
PATIENT: I'm trying to get back[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You're coming back in the right direction that can only help [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah when I get out of the shower and I have an electronic scale [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm uh 179.4.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: To 181. something.
DOCTOR: Okay so on your home scale you’re in that range.
PATIENT: It's a good scale.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So this is just something we'll keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you're gonna watch your weight and just keeping working with.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You know the rehab will be finishing soon.
PATIENT: Yeah and they have been.
DOCTOR: Yeah keep working on it.
PATIENT: Yeah, as a matter of fact, [REDACTED] has a fantastic park district.
DOCTOR: Oh great.
PATIENT: They always come inside.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: In fact, I can ride my bicycle on beautiful trails, over there where there’s no traffic.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If I get tired there are benches.
DOCTOR: Well great.
PATIENT: I can sit down.
DOCTOR: Great.
PATIENT: Like on the benches and they'll maybe have a big pond and paddle boats [REDACTED] they have [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh oh wow.  Well that sounds like a great place.
PATIENT: It is.
DOCTOR: Okay so.
PATIENT: And I was part of their ceremony for Veterans Day.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Is this the toenail that you're talking about?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Did you bang your foot at all?
PATIENT: I don't know I can't remember.  I don't have much feeling down there.  So I just.
DOCTOR: Your left, your sensation is down because of; do you have diabetes I can't remember?
PATIENT: No I do not.
DOCTOR: Okay I didn't think so.
PATIENT: I [REDACTED] where they took the veins out.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  How long has it been there you think?
PATIENT: Um, two weeks.
DOCTOR: Two weeks okay.  So it looks.
PATIENT: It doesn’t bother me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It looks like you bruised it.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Like you know someone stepped on it or.
PATIENT: I just, saw this other guy.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And it was, he had a fungus; they're going to cut it off.
DOCTOR: Right, so I mean you may have a little bit of fungus in this toenail.  See how that toenail is a little bit like ridged.
PATIENT: Yeah, you know then I worked for PanAm Airlines.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Put in you know, a carriage came down on that toe.
DOCTOR: Came down on this toe? So this you know the other thing with the toes that we worry about?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: In general, you know lots of things, this looks like it got bruised.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If it's still there in a month and it hasn't changed.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And it's still there, we can look at it some more but I think someone just stepped on your toe or you knocked it in the doorway.
PATIENT: Yeah or something.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: I'm wearing shoes and socks lately.
DOCTOR: So [REDACTED] things happen.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And I think that's what it is.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let me listen to your heart and lungs while you're here.
PATIENT: Okay.  I did not take any chances, okay.
DOCTOR: Right exactly.
PATIENT: I’ve been through all this.
DOCTOR: You’ve been through enough.
PATIENT: I told you my son's getting married.
DOCTOR: Yes that's coming up uh in June right?
PATIENT: Yeah the third weekend in June.
DOCTOR: Third weekend in June alright, how's that planning going?
PATIENT: Uh his fiancée allows nobody[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh yeah they're doing that's right you told me, good [REDACTED], you raised a good one there.
PATIENT: And then my daughter's going to get married.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Not too far after that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: A boyfriend from Brazil.
DOCTOR: Oh wow.
PATIENT: But [REDACTED] he works for Microsoft.
DOCTOR: Alright wow.
PATIENT: And he's really a cool guy, a real stand-up guy.
DOCTOR: Alright that sounds cool.  You get to go to Brazil for a reception or anything?
PATIENT: Uh no they haven't decided their plans yet.  Right now they're moving into a new townhouse together.
DOCTOR: Well okay.  Deep breath for me.  Okay good.  Let me just go up under your sweatshirt.  Okay you can breathe normally now.  Great.  Any belly pain or anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay [REDACTED]Any belly pain or anything?  This little mole, has it been like that for a long time?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Or is it new okay.  It's been there a long time?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Okay and do you wear sunscreen when you go out in the summertime and things like that?
PATIENT: Yeah I wear my sunglasses.
DOCTOR: You wear your sunglasses, no sunscreen on your face?
PATIENT: Not usually.
DOCTOR: Not usually okay.  You're a fair-skinned guy so I'm just looking and you look like you've had some sun exposure in your life you know.
PATIENT: Well I lived in in California.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I just took my convertible today.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Out of uh.
DOCTOR: Storage?
PATIENT: Storage yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, you can hop on down.
PATIENT: So I just want to feel [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I put the top down.
DOCTOR: Yeah, alright.
PATIENT: I know I'm not supposed to do that but it feels so good.
DOCTOR: Feels good, feels good.  You could get some lotion that has a little bit of sunscreen in it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So that when you use the lotion you automatically get some sunscreen [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It’s so greasy.
DOCTOR: Alright and another thing to check.
PATIENT: You don't think about why it’s hard it is for me to walk across the parking lot and breathe.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I've got to quick talk to my supervisor.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll see if they already talked about it.
PATIENT: Yeah let's do.
DOCTOR: You're just doing so well in the Cardiac Rehab that I, I have such a hard time.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Trying to pin it on the heart disease you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You're doing so well with that, that.
PATIENT: I did very well.
DOCTOR: Now does it tend to happen if you go up to the park district and you're walking around the park district and you know there's no cars and no traffic and people, there's not a lot of people around, do you still get short of breath when you start walking there?
PATIENT: I haven't started that yet.
DOCTOR: Haven't done that yet.
PATIENT: Cause [REDACTED] a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And sometime this week I’ll go [REDACTED] coming down [REDACTED] cause it doesn't cost me anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um, let's see.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  If you want to do some shopping, it's right across from Oakbrook.
DOCTOR: Yeah I've heard.  I mean I've heard good things about it.  Uh just a quick check here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Health maintenance type of stuff, sort of you know tune-up stuff to make sure everything's all good to go for you.  And you had a pneumonia vaccine in October so you're up-to-date for that.  You had your flu shot in October so that's good.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Your tetanus um do you spend any time with young kids, do you have any interaction with grandchildren or little kids a lot?
PATIENT: Uh not yet, I’d like them to be close.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So your tetanus shot, for the tetanus part is up-to-date.  You had it in 2009.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And it is normally a ten year type of shot.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So it's up-to-date technically speaking but the new tetanus shots also protect against whooping cough which tends to be, it's called pertussis another name for it.  Little kids get that, older adults can pass it to little kids so if you have a lot of contact you know kind of younger people, I'd recommend you to get the TDAP, otherwise we can wait.
PATIENT: Yeah well my son told me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know, uh [REDACTED] he and his fiancée are around her parents, they offered to do it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Pay for the honeymoon.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: This afternoon, he said, dad I'd would rather, they're not young anymore, he said dad I'd rather you babysit for us.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Yeah that's good.
PATIENT: You know it looks like [REDACTED] in the family and you don't get [REDACTED] and I do not mind doing that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you don’t mind babysitting.
PATIENT: I don't mind babysitting or changing diapers.
DOCTOR: Excellent.
PATIENT: If it means they can keep going to work.
DOCTOR: So we can defer the tetanus for now but we can keep it in our discussions [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah keep it in, by all means.
DOCTOR: As time goes on.
PATIENT: You know because.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: If they do, [REDACTED] decide.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And you know [REDACTED] I'd want to do this, I want to make sure the baby's safe.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Sounds good.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay, good.
DOCTOR: We'll just keep alerting me to it. We’ll just keep talking about it as it comes up.  We'll just defer it for right now and then it looks like, it sounds like you had a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: Yes I did.
DOCTOR: In 2010, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Does that sound right and.
PATIENT: I had some large ones, so they said I had to get them more often.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now that's brings up the one problem that I forgot.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That after a bowel movement.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Um it seems that for the rest of the day I’m always having to wipe.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Sounds like it's, are your stools hard?
PATIENT: They could be hard or soft.
DOCTOR: Hard or soft okay.  Um you could try something like personal wipes to have a little bit more moisture that might help.  If you do have a bowel movement and it’s a little stickier, or just kind of bulk up your diet with some fiber might help too.
PATIENT: Okay.  I eat fiber every day.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.
PATIENT: So and the one thing I found that helps, [REDACTED] cheese.
DOCTOR: That can be constipating.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If it's you know, that can be constipating. If it helps, you can try it, it's just.
PATIENT: It does help.
DOCTOR: You've got to watch your cholesterol though.
PATIENT: Yeah I know.
DOCTOR: Too there.  I was looking at your colonoscopy and it looks like they did find one and um.
PATIENT: Removed it.
DOCTOR: Um that was renewed so [REDACTED] screening.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I wanted to watch, because they had the screen [REDACTED] neat to watch it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay.  So it looks like you had one that was a little bit bigger so normally they want you to follow-up in like five years.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I can double check but it will probably be five years from that so you know [REDACTED]@ you'll be due for that okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So the last thing, which they recommend to all Veterans between 18 and you know 125 is to get a onetime HIV check, just a screen um to just as a health care preventative measure.  So we can do that the next time you get blood drawn if you're okay with that.
PATIENT: I'm okay with that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know I how I would've picked it up.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I'm okay with that.
DOCTOR: Okay so next time we need verbal consent for.
PATIENT: You'll get it.
DOCTOR: If it's okay so the next time you get labs drawn on the order that it's okay and they'll take care of it.
PATIENT: Done.
DOCTOR: Okay alright let me just run and talk to my supervisor to make sure I'm not missing anything from their standpoint and then you'll be on your way okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] if you and the doctor had been only suspicious uh I wouldn't be alive today.
DOCTOR: Well.
PATIENT: Because they did a quadruple bypass.
DOCTOR: Yeah well I'm glad everything worked out and I have to tell you I think you told me this before, we were so not suspicious but we just thought you kept having questions and we were like well let's his question, we don't think [REDACTED] remember we told you all the time.
PATIENT: Yeah right.
DOCTOR: Even if it’s positive this might not be real.
PATIENT: It was positive.
DOCTOR: It was positive, we didn't want to get you worried but I'm just you know.
PATIENT: I'm glad you guys did what you did.
DOCTOR: So thankfully it all worked out and they went in, you're on the upswing now okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I'm going to be right back.
PATIENT: Okay as far as my brain goes will it be okay?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: As far as oxygen and stuff like that because there are things I want to do with it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Things you want to do with your brain?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: There's a lot of things you need to do with your brain, I'll ask him about it.  It sounds kind of like cluster headaches the way that you describe them.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So let me see if there's anything.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know to do about it.
PATIENT: Cause I'm going to be processing a really cool, intelligent kind of thing [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I'm not going to promise not to [REDACTED] it's going to be more than that.
DOCTOR: More than that, search robots or something.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Artificial intelligence, alright I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  55:16  DOCTOR IN:  63:06)
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I think we're done.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We talked about the headaches and the shortness of breath.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think these are all things that are sort of going to get better as time goes by.
PATIENT: Dissipate, okay.
DOCTOR: So, for the headaches,
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So who knows, sometimes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We get these little things and they happen and they are severe.  What I want to know from you is what to keep an eye out for is if they start getting significantly closer together where you're having them, now you're having them instead once a month or once every two weeks you're having the every day okay.  That's something I want to know about if you're noticing when it happens you know weakness or neurological changes otherwise you're feeling like your speech is slurred or anything like that you know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Those are important things I want to know about.  So they just come on and then you know dissipate and go away completely and you know they're pretty infrequent, few and far between, nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay so.  If any of those things change obviously let me know but we're not.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR:
DOCTOR: not too concerned about it. The shortness of breath…
I think it's probably related to a combination of you know you do these activities, in your life and you’re not warmed up for them you know as well as in rehab so you may be a little bit more short of breath in this setting and that setting than in the rehab setting.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The good news for us is like you said a hundred times within the last two months your cardiac stuff has been golden and you know your tests have all been great.  You're doing fantastically in the rehab above and beyond.  All of those things are looking great so it doesn't you know concern us for a heart, a heart problem.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: …shortness of breath. I do want to ask you, did you ever smoke?  So you quit in 1966 so you really don't have much of a smoking history.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Whatsoever.  So how much did you smoke before 1966?
PATIENT: I had just started it.
DOCTOR: Just like two packs or?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: A pack, less than a pack?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that was because it was the thing to do.
DOCTOR: Yeah in the military and then.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So that's the only thing I wanted to make sure you didn't have a significant smoking history.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: In the past.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No, you do not.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So that is nothing I'll look into.
PATIENT: It's like since 1966; it was when I was in the Marine Corps.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh I had uh I had passed out.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: At the Mess Hall.  You'd get a certain amount of Mess Hall and then they have you rifle range[REDACTED] and so I was in the hospital for two weeks, they couldn't figure out what the hell happened.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Hmm.
PATIENT: But they came to me and said look your family has a history of sarcoidosis.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Stop smoking.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I stopped instantly.
DOCTOR: Instantly yeah.
PATIENT: I saw too many members of my family die.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh yeah.
PATIENT: So I stopped.
DOCTOR: Stopped yeah.
PATIENT: That's why I can say 1966.
DOCTOR: 1966 okay.  Excellent okay.  So I think this is a watchful waiting type of thing as well.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I think with everything going on, again if things are progressing and you know they get worse when you think they should be getting better, then.
PATIENT: We’ll check.
DOCTOR: We'll dig into things more.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But I think right now you have reasons to have some you know, you're not in the condition that you know you were in a year ago this time.  So let’s give it a little t-shirt time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know, sometimes, the best medicine. We'll keep an eye on things.  You let me know if things drastically change and we'll just kind of go from there okay.
PATIENT: My body will tell me.  I'll call you.
DOCTOR: Right, exactly.  So my other question is, from my standpoint and then if you know if assuming all things the same and nothing else is going on and we don't need to see you again and in my opinion really six months is okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I think six months, are you going to be here in six months?
DOCTOR: I will be here in six months.
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: I will be here in six months.
PATIENT: Yeah six months is fine.
DOCTOR: Six months, obviously call if anything is going on.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um and so we'll go from there okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll keep chatting about uh if about these things change, okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  And you'll get labs checked at that time okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So we'll just have the annual labs done at that time okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Good to see you.
PATIENT: I thank you for everything.
DOCTOR: You're welcome.  You're welcome.
PATIENT: And so my [REDACTED] are doing well.
DOCTOR: I was just going to say I read that you're doing the recreational therapy and taking the guitar lessons and that has to be awesome.
PATIENT: Well DOCTOR said you need to [REDACTED]you brain back and functioning.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And by doing this and exercising [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It'll help.
DOCTOR: It'll help and it keeps your mind off of things too.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: If you feel a little bit stress, that's a great idea.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So we'll just have you just check out here on your way out and [REDACTED] here.
PATIENT: Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, here you go.  See you soon.
PATIENT: Okay and thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're welcome take care.  [REDACTED].
