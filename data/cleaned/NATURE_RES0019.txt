DOCTOR: OK, how about any heart conditions?
PATIENT: Um, my father passed away at 75 from a heart attack.
DOCTOR: OK, and uh, how about any cancers in the family?
PATIENT: None that I know of.
DOCTOR: OK. So I think that was, uh, all of the questions that I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that you thought I was missing or that you wanted to tell me about?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. But, uh, what do you think I have?
DOCTOR: So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count. But um, for now we will get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions?
PATIENT: OK yeah that sounds great. Do you think I could also have you know, meningitis or something? 'Cause I was reading online on Google and that's the first thing that came up.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, you're you're absolutely right, so, um sorry, I we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics.
PATIENT: OK, alright that sounds good, thank you.
