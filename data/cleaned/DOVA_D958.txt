PATIENT: I got to be able to have a little blood pressure.  It's just like in a car, when the oil pressure is high the car runs good.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: When my blood pressure's high I run good.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  See, the thing about your blood pressure going high is something getting to 300 that's um an impending stroke.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: You should never feel your blood pressure, even if it's high you shouldn't feel it, that's you know, that's concerning cause it's a risk for stroke.
PATIENT: No I can feel it when it's high.
DOCTOR: That's what I'm saying cause that means it's getting way too high and its way too late.  It shouldn't be like that.
PATIENT: Oh well, where it's at now, it's not bad.  I would say fair to midland right there.  It goes down though.
DOCTOR: How low does it go?
PATIENT: It goes down pretty low after I'm up out of my car for a couple days.

PATIENT: My car is a testimony to that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: My car is 15 years old and never been in an accident.  Young kid who lives out in the western suburbs drove all the way over by where my house is just to run into me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: On my side of the street, he ran head on into me.

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh but the thing is.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The insurance company wouldn't pay to fix my car.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because they said it was too old.  They gave me lot value for the car which is not what the car was worth.  That car was offered 20 grand for the damn thing and all they gave me for the car was $1800 to fix it and it was $3000 worth of damage.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They only gave me $1800.  I was offered 20 grand for that car, that's $20,000 and I refused it you see.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because I liked that car.  It's a 96 Oldsmobile.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's the last one of its kind made.
DOCTOR: Oh really hmm.
PATIENT: So it was worth a lot of money.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It was worth more than 20 grand seeing that it was the last one made.  The kid wanted to buy it, he offered me 20 for it, I told him to go home and get some more money.  He asked me how much I wanted for it and I said well seeing that it's the last one made you got a million dollars I'd sell it to you.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But some other jerk had to hit it, now it was in an accident; I got to get a bumper, a new dash, steering wheel.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh the grill in front.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: A fender and a hood.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And all that, plus its gotta be painted and the guy I took it to talking about $3000 I said yeah could you do it for what the insurance company paid me and then he laughed at me, no.  I, oh,  well.
DOCTOR: Alright how low does your blood pressure get at home?
PATIENT: Uh I'd say it gets around 180, around 180, 185, something like that.  That's kind of low.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But when it gets really low, I don't know what it is, I just don't feel like moving at all.  I just sit there and fall asleep you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But that doesn't bother me falling asleep because I only get like three or four hours of sleep at night.  I got.
DOCTOR: Alright so let's talk about your blood pressure again.

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I hum and it goes away, blood pressure goes down, the head don't hurt.
DOCTOR: What causes your blood pressure to be that high, what's going on?
PATIENT: It's something that, whenever something strikes me and pisses me off real bad.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then my blood pressure goes high.
DOCTOR: What pisses you off that bad?
PATIENT: My blood pressure goes high when I'm babysitting and I baby-sit seven days a week.

DOCTOR: I understand that.
PATIENT: A lot of pain killers that they give me in the hospital do not work uh when they find one that does work they tell me oh no we can't give you that one no more.  Now the only one that worked when I was in the hospital before was Demerol.  Nothing else they give me uh the codeine uh Tylenol with codeine and everything.  That was like eating an M & M.
DOCTOR: Hmm.

DOCTOR: Uh it's 200/100.  It's still pretty high.

PATIENT: You see that.  Usually I can see the bone here real sharp and on my feet I could see the veins and stuff when I'm not swelling up and the leg is a lot skinnier here but I know that I'm swelling.  I can feel it in my feet.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know the feet feel swollen.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh so I know I got swellness in my legs.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Probably all the way up to the hip I don't know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: Hmm.  What about, do you see a naturopath?  There are natural doctors that.
PATIENT: A what?
DOCTOR: A naturopath.  They're called naturopaths; they're doctors who do natural medications.
PATIENT: That's what I like natural medications.
DOCTOR: We don't have them in this hospital.
PATIENT: You don't have them in this hospital.
DOCTOR: Yeah but you know they exist and you could look them up and see them so they can kind of help you with your medications and everything.
PATIENT: Uh yeah I could.  Do you have uh?
DOCTOR: I don't have any.
PATIENT: You don't have any huh.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Cause I mean if you had one uh I'd call them and find out or get an appointment with him or something.
DOCTOR: I don't have one.
PATIENT: Because uh I wish they had them here in the hospital you know.  There's one old doctor in here that I can't remember his name but uh.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He is the one that I uh checked on a lot of the drugs that they were giving me already.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I told him what I was feeling from them and he said well they all have side effects and that and he told me about the uh the one for the cholesterol and I said well I definitely don't want a fractured hip so that one's out and I tell him I says when I get uh higher blood pressure from taking this one pill and he said that pill yeah okay and he told me about that one, then I asked him about the Plavix.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And he said well actually all Plavix is like baby aspirin.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He says same thing as baby aspirin but it doesn't have aspirin in it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: No aspirin in it I said well that sounds good.  Aspirin that's not aspirin well and he says yeah and I couldn't find, everything I read didn't say nothing about Plavix being bad so I kept taking that.  Now I hear a report on it saying that it doesn't do nothing.
DOCTOR: The Plavix?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: That's what somebody wrote a report on so it got into the news and everything, it was on the news and I asked that same doctor about it and he says well somebody's blowing smoke he said because.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He says well some people, he says for some people it doesn't, I don't know.  Does Plavix work the same for everybody or not?
DOCTOR: It should.
PATIENT: Uh but he said for some people it don't.  I said for me I think it works actually I think it keeps the platelets from sticking together because I don't have any more pain in my chest.  I used to get pain in my chest uh before when I didn't take the Plavix so I keep it, I been taking it ever since I had this done you know and until I can find something to take its place natural then I'll keep taking Plavix.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But right now I haven't found anything so.  I'll keep looking in my books and different health food stores.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: I'll find something that'll take the place of it.
DOCTOR: Of Plavix?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Well you take it easy.
DOCTOR: You too.
PATIENT: And I thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Thank you take care.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: See you next time; you can leave the door open.
PATIENT: You're a very nice doctor you listen, most of them don't.  The dudes they don't want to listen.  They think they know everything.  The guys you know, come fresh out of school, they know everything.  They don't.  Even the old doctors don't know everything.
DOCTOR: Nobody knows everything.
PATIENT: When I went in because uh my daughters called and I didn't want to go, they forced me to go in there, I went in there, this old doctor.  I don't know, had to be in his 50s, started telling me well you got to stop drinking and smoking.  I haven't smoked a cigarette since I was 25 years old.  I haven't gotten drunk since I was probably about 30.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I'm 70 now so because he was so serious about it in the hospital talking this shit I said to him I said okay doc I'll quit all of it.  I'll quit cold turkey right now cause I wasn't doing it in the first place.
