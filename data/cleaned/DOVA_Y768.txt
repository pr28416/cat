PATIENT: Oh it may be six months maybe.
DOCTOR: Maybe the same time as this cough?
PATIENT: No the cough was going on before that.
DOCTOR: That medicine's new?
PATIENT: Well I been on it.
DOCTOR: Well actually it looks like it was started in February of 09.
PATIENT: Okay has it been that long?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So it would have been about a year ago, about the same time as the cough.
PATIENT: No I can't remember hmm.
DOCTOR: Yeah time flies when you're having fun.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You been having fun?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: A little bit of fun, not too much?
PATIENT: I haven't been too dull though.
DOCTOR: That's right.  Uh what about, did you ever notice any like sinus drainage or like in the back of your throat when you wake up in the morning, do you ever feel?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Anything like there's something back there you got to clear.
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Nothing like that okay.
PATIENT: Well sometimes I do.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um what about do you ever get heartburn or reflux?
PATIENT: Not any more, now I was getting that, you know, I haven't gotten that now in a while, in years.
DOCTOR: Do you take medicine for it?
PATIENT: I was.  What was it, omeprazole.
DOCTOR: Omeprazole yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah as such it went away and I stopped taking it.
DOCTOR: What pills are you taking, just those two for blood pressure?
PATIENT: I take the blood pressure pills.  I take stool softeners.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I take metformin.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I take that you know the prostate thing at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And that should be about it.
PATIENT: Yeah should be about it.  I came in here back in February.  I came to the Emergency Room.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they did some blood work on me for, for I think checking for kidneys or something because of the prostate pill that I was taking.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: How does that look?
DOCTOR: In January?
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Your liver function tests were normal.  Yeah it looks like all they checked was your liver function.
PATIENT: I think so.  Yeah and I wanted to see about my blood count.  I haven't had nothing did on that in a while.
DOCTOR: Yeah we should check some labs today, check some urine today.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um and then the thing with the chronic cough like that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um have you had a chest x-ray recently?
PATIENT: No, except when I had the surgery back in last August.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think it was last August I had one.
DOCTOR: Um have you ever been exposed to TB, tuberculosis that you know of?  Worked in a hospital or been in jail?
PATIENT: Yeah, now a guy that I knew, sometime an old fellow I knew he had it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I came in.
DOCTOR: You didn't live with him or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright.
PATIENT: But I came here right after I'd heard and had a TB test about a year ago.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know it doesn't sound like TB.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So with a chronic cough the three most common things are could be a little bit of heartburn or reflux can irritate your vocal cords and sometimes you don't even notice it.  You don't even get the heartburn but enough acid gets up there to irritate it.  Um another thing can be the postnasal drip like the back of your sinuses can drip down into the back of your throat.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Irritate the vocal cords.  So it sounds like maybe a little bit of each of those could be contributing but also what might be most likely it's this medicine lisinopril.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's it's most common side effect is a cough and it sounds like the cough started around the same time you started that medication so I think it would be worthwhile to stop the lisinopril, see how you do um.  Your pressure today is pretty good.  Your pressure, you know we may not even need that lisinopril on there cause for the most part.  Like I don't think we need to replace lisinopril with another blood pressure medicine.  I think at this time we could just stop that and continue the water pill.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And if your pressure gets too high then we'll add a blood pressure medicine next time.  Can you take your shirt off and I'll get a good listen to your lungs.  And you haven't noticed like any chronic fever or weight loss or anything like that have you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Could you take your other shirt off for me please?  Big deep breath.  Take a breath. Listen to your  heart.  Open your mouth, say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Stick your tongue out a little bit.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Real wide ah.  Okay relax and then open wide ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Again.  No pain here right?  Yeah I think we'll try first stopping that uh, stopping that medicine, the lisinopril.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And that should take care of your cough.  If that doesn't work I think the next step would be maybe restarting that pill for your stomach because you could be having heartburn that is just enough to get up.  For instance since it's worse in the morning when you lay flat, the stomach contents can kind of travel up your esophagus and then irritate the vocal cords.  It might not be enough for you to feel it, feel the burning but it may be enough to cause that cough.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Well start first with that lisinopril.
PATIENT: Okay.  And also I need my refills.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  I'll refill them.
PATIENT: Yeah cause the nurse was checking and she said something about some of them needed to be renewed.
DOCTOR: Sure.  I'll be right back.  I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Hmm.
(DOCTOR OUT:  15:35  DOCTOR IN:  18:56)
DOCTOR: Alright so um, had a little bit different strategy.  It could be, it could definitely be the lisinopril but because it sounds like it's a little worse in the morning, that kind of leans more toward it being that reflux irritating it.  So I was going to talk it over with DOCTOR and we thought first we would try the omeprazole, that pill for your stomach, try it twice in the day and one in the night.  Um the best way to take that is on an empty stomach and then don't eat for about 30-60 minutes because that gives it time to absorb and it decreases the acid production.  Uh take that morning and night.  We're also gonna get a chest x-ray since it's been going on for a year.  Um and then we'll see you back here in about a month um, about four weeks, see if it's better.  If it's better then good, if not then we'll try stopping the lisinopril and switching that to a different medication.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because of your diabetes you should be on a medicine either in the class of medicines like lisinopril is in or another class which is very similar, helps protect your kidneys, especially in diabetic patients.  So um sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh and then have you get some blood work today too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you can head to the Pharmacy, Radiology and less than a month they'll schedule you your follow-up with me in four weeks.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And then oh head to the Lab too, cause that's gonna check your diabetes measures and uh some other blood work as well too.
PATIENT: Okay.  So I go to the Lab.
DOCTOR: Lab, Pharmacy and Radiology.
PATIENT: Oh that on the third floor, this floor?
DOCTOR: Um actually Outpatient is on this floor, it's all on this floor.
PATIENT: The Radiology?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Where's that?
DOCTOR: It's right next to the Lab.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: You now what I mean, you're looking at the Lab its right there.
PATIENT: Oh okay.  Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: I'll see you in about a month.
PATIENT: Okay.  So I go to the Pharmacy and then [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Oh okay.  And you renewed the other ones [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Alright thank you.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: 21:51
