DOCTOR: OK, so meeting all milestones and?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: OK. And in regards to, uhm, birth history, were there any complications throughout pregnancy or, or at birth?

PATIENT: No, just been at home.
DOCTOR: OK, uhm, and has anybody in the, else in the family have cystic fibrosis?
PATIENT: No, no, no, no one else does. But we got tested and we were both found, my, my husband and I were found out have the gene for it. We were carriers.
DOCTOR: OK, uhm, I see. And any, any heart conditions or, or other lung conditions that run in the family?
PATIENT: No, nothing else.
DOCTOR: OK. And were there any other symptoms that, or anything else that you wanted to tell me that maybe I forgot to ask about?
PATIENT: Uhm, no, I was just, uh, I'm just worried about him, uhm about his fever specifically, it's been high and I know that usually when he has these hospitalizations, he presents pretty similarly. So just wondering if he would need to be hospitalized again and if he needs antibiotics.
DOCTOR: Yeah, for sure it's, it's been uhm, so it's been three or four days, but with a fever this high and his symptoms, with uh, having obstruction, discharge, uhm, changes to smell or loss of smell it does sound like it could be bacterial and so I think it would be reasonable to possibly to start antibiotics in this case, but we'll go through, through a physical exam, check some vitals and go from there.
PATIENT: Ok, Ok, sounds good, thank you.
