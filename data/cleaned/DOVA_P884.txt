DOCTOR: So I see you saw the eye doctors today.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh so far.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah what do you think is [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes.  The reason [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
PATIENT: I say that's the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You’re still having the diarrhea?  You can have a seat.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: How often are you having it?
PATIENT: Quite often.
DOCTOR: What’s “quite often?”
PATIENT: It’s like all day long, non-stop.  It's like.
DOCTOR: How many episodes a day?
PATIENT: Something like, usually one before I go to work, probably once or twice, get to work, I have to use it twice, when I get home usually and when I go to bed I have to use it.  The other morning like 3 or 4 I have to go to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] times?
PATIENT: It’s like constantly. It’s like I’m never [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Is it watery?
PATIENT: Yeah.  It's watery and uh real hard.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Like I'm never, I never feel the relief like I can't just go once and I'm done.  It's like more in there.  I expect, they had checked my colon.
DOCTOR: Yeah it was all normal.
PATIENT: Well I think it's in my intestines.
DOCTOR: Well it's the same thing, colon is the intestines.  They look at your entire intestines with a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: They got these, so I think I got [REDACTED] that's all or a tapeworm or something. Something ain't right.
DOCTOR: Are you losing any weight or gaining weight?
PATIENT: No.  Still the same size.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Well when I use it there is so much that come out at once.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's a lot.
DOCTOR: I know it's hard, absolutely.  Do you feel anxious at all?  Do you feel like you're stressed out or anything like that or?  No, okay.  Your blood pressure looks good today.  You're taking your two medicines correct.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Perfect and at home it's been looking okay?
PATIENT: I really haven't been checking.
DOCTOR: That's okay it looks good today, that's fine and are you taking the psyllium powder?
PATIENT: Yeah, not that often but I take it.
DOCTOR: Try to take it as often as you can, daily or something like that.  I don't know if it'll help but.
PATIENT: No it ain't no help.
DOCTOR: Try that.
PATIENT: I had surgery on my groin.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you have a…
PATIENT: Yeah I have another one, it's like not in the groin area.  It's like up under my scrotum.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, when did you first notice that?
PATIENT: About a month ago.
DOCTOR: Okay and has it gotten bigger?
PATIENT: It was, it went down now but.
DOCTOR: It's okay.
PATIENT: It keeps coming and going though.
DOCTOR: Um do you want to go see surgery again?  Do you want to get it drained or just going down, what do you want to do?
PATIENT: Uh I could get it looked at, see if they could drain.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What did they do for it or does it just go down?  Did you do anything?
PATIENT: Keeping it clean.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any burning when you urinate? Any penile discharge?
PATIENT: No.  It gets really hard, like a knot.
DOCTOR: Yeah and does it ever have any pus come out of it or anything like that?
PATIENT: No.  Well I mean, do you know where that come from?  Why I keep getting them?
DOCTOR: Well some people just have a certain bacteria and they are prone to get what's called furuncle they're little abscesses and they tend to be in areas that are more moist, so the groin area.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] sometimes in the armpits and they tend to do that.  So you know keeping it clean and that'll go a long way and help out and know some people are prone to get it because they have what's called [REDACTED] a certain bacteria in their body; from one source or another, who knows and then for some reason some people are more prone to develop these little abscesses, they just have to keep getting drained.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's annoying.  When was the last time that you saw the surgeons?
PATIENT: Um it's been a while.
DOCTOR: It's been a while.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well when was the last time you got it drained?
PATIENT: Hmm February.
DOCTOR: February.
PATIENT: February, March.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay very good.  I'm gonna take a listen to you.  [REDACTED].  Did you get your flu shot this year?
PATIENT: Uh yeah I got it at my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect.  Do you need any refills on your blood pressure medicine?
PATIENT: Uh yeah you can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Want to get it mailed to you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Take some deep breaths.  One more, good.  Breathe normally.  No belly pain or anything like that?
PATIENT: Just be feeling light.
DOCTOR: Does it feel full, like fluid or?
PATIENT: I just feel like almost it's uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm not sure I be feeling like that but then it puffed out again.
DOCTOR: Do you feel fuller, is it painful?
PATIENT: No I ain't full.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's still, like maybe it's like my stomach gets to growling [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Any swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: No.  That's a little, like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Just a little [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I think.
DOCTOR: Let me go check a couple of things and I'll be back okay.
PATIENT: You want to take a look at the uh?
DOCTOR: Yeah I [REDACTED] take a look at it.  Go ahead [REDACTED]@.  Has it gotten bigger do you think?
PATIENT: It was hard, it’s still big like, but not as high as it was. It’s right here.
DOCTOR: Right there?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You don't have any other ones that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well I usually get them like in here.
DOCTOR: Up in the groin.  Yeah right in here, right.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: You don't have anything there.
PATIENT: Just this thing here.
DOCTOR: There’s no lesion on your penis? You never had a lesion or anything like that.
PATIENT: I got little bumps on the tip like that.
DOCTOR: Let me see.  Have you always had that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is that, that's not new.
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah if it’s going back down [REDACTED] Surgery to go look at it or um just wait for it to go down, whatever you want.  Uh that area is a little bit harder to drain if it's that small.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You know what I mean.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It's a little bit harder if it's that small but um it's something I can refer you [REDACTED], no problem.  Or we can wait and see if it goes down [REDACTED] about it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: What do you want to do?
PATIENT: I can wait.
DOCTOR: Yeah so [REDACTED] it seems pretty superficial.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: They just have to be careful when they drain it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And if it's going down, maybe not mess with it right now.  It's a pretty invasive procedure and that's a pretty [REDACTED] area.  I'll be right back.
(DOCTOR OUT:  19:44  DOCTOR IN:  27:20)
DOCTOR: Alright sir.  So in terms of constant diarrhea I'm not quite sure what else you can do from the General Medicine Clinic other than reinforce the fiber, things that we’ve told you before so I know you’re going back to the GI doctors too so um.  [REDACTED] back to the Surgery Clinic and maybe have them take a look at it and see if it does get bigger, to have it at least looked at you know and they can compare it and then uh for your blood pressure, let's see.  One of the numbers is a little bit high today and I was wondering if we should go up on one of your medicines.  Yeah, cause even the lower number has been a little bit on the higher side and so the metoprolol you take 25 mg twice a day?
PATIENT: Yeah half pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah why don't go to a whole pill?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and then if it makes you dizzy then drop back to a half a pill and then come back in.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay I need to put it into the system for you and you have two refills of the hydrochlorothiazide so I'll go ahead and refill it as well.  And then, other than that I think that's everything.  You got your flu shot and everything.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I'll have you go back up there and make an appointment with the General Surgery Clinic, the door to where you check in.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And then you'll go there.  The next time I see you um, which will probably be in three or four months or so, go ahead and go to the Lab before you come in and get a cholesterol panel done.
PATIENT: Cholesterol panel?
DOCTOR: Yeah it's a cholesterol level, you just do it once a year.  You had it in November of last year and did you eat lunch or breakfast today?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Well we can do then today if you want; if you don't want to we'll have you do it when you come back, whichever one you would prefer.
PATIENT: Uh I'll get it cause I'm here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll put in to do that do that today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: So where do I go to get those done?
DOCTOR: Right across the hall here.  Right across the hall, go to the Lab.
PATIENT: Oh the Lab okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] you have a nice day.
PATIENT: Alright thanks.
PATIENT: 29:48.
