DOCTOR: Hello.
PATIENT: Hi, good to see you.
DOCTOR: Nice to see you, come on back here.
PATIENT: How are you?
DOCTOR: Doing okay?
PATIENT: Okay, how are you?
DOCTOR: Good, yeah good to see you again.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah that's too long yeah.
DOCTOR: You doing fine on the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh great.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Why is that?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Oh do you take his vitals?
SECOND PERSON E376
Oh no I watch them.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
SECOND PERSON E376
They gave us.  They were [REDACTED] I think it was like in the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right, right.  Um tell me about the arm.
PATIENT: Well we got that, it's like static, [REDACTED] from switching over in my arms but it seems like to me I feel like it bothers me here, it usually feels swollen to me, maybe I’m just imagining it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But it seems like it’s swollen in here, but suddenly here is especially where it hurts me.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Does it come; do you get pain in your neck at all?  No.
So it's just [REDACTED] the arm.
PATIENT: But once I turn my head it'll go away.
DOCTOR: Oh I remember that from last time.
PATIENT: Remember.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh.
PATIENT: And they cancelled my appointment and I've been trying to call them to see if they'd give me another appointment and they never return my calls.
DOCTOR: Appointment with who?
PATIENT: Well for my arms.
DOCTOR: With the physical therapist, is that what it was?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I remember.  I do, I know it was something with your arm and now I remember you saying when you bend that way is what makes it better.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] canceled. I don't know why.  Alright well we'll re-set it up.  I'm sorry; I don't know why that happens.
PATIENT: I called them twice and twice they never answered me.  Never gave me a return call.  Try to find out cause I thought maybe that's what you wanted to know.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's the one thing.  What we do is uh help us decide where the um you know where the nerve is obstructed so.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You're having and I think we talked about it last time, but you're having this sensation like electrical sensation down there.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Right and um you know we know that you have like problems with the back.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But usually most of the time the problems that we know about are down here, not as much up here.
PATIENT: No right.
DOCTOR: Um and you know you're symptoms are limited, kind of like here to here.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I don't know exactly where the problem is, so I wanted to do that test to see and I'm not sure why.  Of course they don't give any information, it just says will reschedule.
PATIENT: I tried to explain it to them that I'm seeing you today.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I'm sure you want to know the results.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I thought I was coming here for nothing you know.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Then I couldn’t get the results.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.  So you probably coming here for nothing but definitely it's not your fault.  I'm glad you tried um you know, just it's unfortunately sometimes the way the system works.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And I don't know if they've ever a perfect way to fix it but I'll try to reschedule it again.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll see if we can get you done um cause it's hard for me to know exactly what's the best way to treat it.  You know take this off, let me examine it again okay.  Otherwise things are good?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Just my back in the morning you know.  I get up and there's a lot of pain when I walk but after I walk for a while it'll go away.
DOCTOR: Once you're up yeah.
PATIENT: Do you want me to sit? [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No, no. That’s good. Okay so the pain is, it starts down here and shoots up right?
PATIENT: Down in here and then here.  Right here, for some reason it bothers me.
DOCTOR: That's what you were saying you feel like it can get a little swollen or so.
PATIENT: If feels that way yeah.
DOCTOR: Does it hurt when I push on it?
PATIENT: No it didn't, it does sometimes but.
DOCTOR: But not right now.
PATIENT: No I can feel it there.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Is it like tender?
PATIENT: No it's just, [REDACTED]. But just right in here is where it bothers me.  Right now it's not [REDACTED] there.
DOCTOR: Right in there huh.
PATIENT: Right there.
DOCTOR: Now it's only this arm right, it's not the left arm.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: It's not in your legs.
PATIENT: Just the one arm.  I fell down about three months ago and it didn't bother me and then all of a sudden about two or three weeks later is when all this started.  I don't know if that's what did it.
DOCTOR: How'd you fall?
PATIENT: I fell down two flights of stairs [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Wow how'd you do that?
PATIENT: I fell right on here.  I hit the wall you know with my arm but it didn't bother me.
DOCTOR: Was it hurting you before then?  Before you fell?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So after you fell was when that started?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh that's a new piece of information okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So how did you, what made you fall?
PATIENT: Well I was coming out of the washroom and I have two steps coming out and down and one going up and I forgot about them steps and I you know, without knowing [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I fell up against the wall.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you kind of bumped that shoulder and that arm into the wall.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And since then is when you've been having the pain?
PATIENT: Well maybe a week after that.  It didn't bother me at so I didn't do nothing till it bothered me.
DOCTOR: Okay hmm, that's interesting.  Um I don't know that it helped me figure out what it is but it's interesting and that's probably something to do with that.  Um squeeze my fingers good.  Now pull me towards you good.  Push me away.  So I'm just checking you know for strength [REDACTED] for the triceps, pushing with the triceps, squeezing to make sure that you have [REDACTED].  Your strength is really good, it's the same on both sides and that's kind of the easiest way to tell.  You know you want to compare from side to side, especially since this arm isn’t bothering him.  Um okay and uh something that was going well [REDACTED] making sure I wasn’t causing pain with pronation, supination, nothing we can do to make it worse when we do that huh.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: When I let you pull and then push that didn’t seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And usually when it starts is when I'm sitting [REDACTED] like this here.  As soon as I take it off [REDACTED] it'll go away.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And if I leave my arm long enough it'll start, that'll start.
DOCTOR: No swelling?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No swelling in your face or neck or anything like that basically?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um no headaches?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay um when you turn the neck away, it gets better.
PATIENT: It is better.
DOCTOR: See one thing I’m thinking is is I don't know if you've gotten to this in gross anatomy is radial plexus. [REDACTED] Radial plexus is basically a collection of nerves that comes down the spinal cord [REDACTED] down the arm.  I'm gonna, this is for both of you [REDACTED].  But basically the nerves will come out and they come down the arms and they go to different places um to your biceps, to your triceps to the muscles here to your hand and it's what allows you to move all this stuff as well as feel sensation there okay.  If when you fell, if you kind of pulled this area you can pull muscles there but you can also actually kind of strain the nerves in that area.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And that can cause a problem um.  I don't know if that's part of what's going on.  Um it would maybe explain why when you move your neck you can get it in a position that it feels better.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um but again the best way would maybe be to do the needle test so that's you know um but this isn't getting any better on its own.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Is it getting worse or it's just the same?
PATIENT: Well it's the same but it bothers me at night you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And it wakes me up.
DOCTOR: Yeah um and you're taking Tylenol which is what you normally take right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Does that help this pain at all?
PATIENT: Yes it does.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright well I guess if it helps.  Does it at least, does it make it more tolerable and help you sleep a little bit better?
PATIENT: Uh yeah if I take the Tylenol but I always take one before I go to bed.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I don't want to take another when I get up you know.
DOCTOR: So really you're only taking right now is the one before you go to bed?
PATIENT: I take two.
DOCTOR: Two before you go to bed.
PATIENT: In the morning on account of my back I'll take one and then one before I go to bed.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  Um I guess um if you think that that's working for now, I'd say we could stick with that until we get the test and see if that helps us figure it out.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: The other thing we could do is we could either try a little bit more Tylenol, which would be okay, you're not taking that much.  We could even go up to.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: We could give you three before you go to bed, would be okay, instead of those two pills if you want or we could even try some Tylenol with codeine if you thought you wanted to try that which would be a little bit stronger mixed with Tylenol with codeine which is kind of a lighter narcotic agent.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And maybe give you a little bit more pain relief until we have a better idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Would you want to try that?
PATIENT: Yes I'll try it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright um but during the day you're able to do everything you need to do?
PATIENT: Yeah that's normal.
DOCTOR: Um okay.  But you don't feel weak or anything, it's really just the.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Pain okay.  How about um just, as far as sleeping, if you maybe are able to put the pillows a certain way to keep your head in that position would that help?
PATIENT: Hmm yeah if I sleep on this side it'll pull my head this way but [REDACTED] I'm leaning on this.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we've never really done an x-ray right?
PATIENT: No not of my arm [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON E376
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um and you have no pain in the shoulder here right?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So lift your arm, no pain doing that?
PATIENT: You know when it bothers me when I'm combing my hair or I'm shaving, that's when it really starts when I'm doing that yeah.  When I comb my hair or shave then it really starts.
DOCTOR: It does seem that one of the nerves that comes in here is being pinched somewhere, whether it's at the shoulder or somewhere at the bicep or in the neck, I'm not totally sure where.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You know cause it seems like certain motions now.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Put your neck like this, put your arm up, something that is pushing it is pinching the nerve um.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um so imaging would help us figure out which nerve it is and then the next step would be what can we do about it so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um to be honest with you I don't know if there's gonna be a perfect answer for this.  I don't know, even once we get the results if I'm gonna be able to say okay now that I know, I know how to fix it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And I might not be able to but at least it might give us an idea.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So let me talk to DOCTOR.  Everything else is good.  We're good with refills and everything?
PATIENT: Well I need lisinopril.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The other ones I got for a couple more weeks.
DOCTOR: Whatever you need is okay.  I'll just have them mailed to you when it runs out?
PATIENT: Yes that's good.  I think I got enough for like ten days.  I don't know if they all have to be reordered anyway.
DOCTOR: I think I did all the others it looks like last time but we'll check and see if you need that one, okay they're refilled.  [REDACTED] a 90 day supply.  Okay I'll be right back alright.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You can put your shirt back on.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  41:56  DOCTOR IN:  45:37)
DOCTOR: Alright, so um DOCTOR and I were talking a little bit.  Um I think it makes sense to do it, so, the test, to do the test, you know cause we just have to find out what it is but kind of like I was saying I don't know for sure that we're gonna be able to fix it once we know.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: But my thought is I'd like to find out and then we can go from there.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um see if it helps.  Um instead of going up on the Tylenol he recommended trying a medicine at night that will maybe help a little bit with sleep but it also gives a neuropathic pain effect.  I other words it gives you pain relief with nerve pain and that's what we think this is.  We think this is an irritation of the nerve.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um and it gives some help with that so I probably instead of increasing do the Tylenol with codeine and we'll try that to see if it helps.
PATIENT: It's not going to interfere with aspirin is it?
DOCTOR: Nope doesn't interfere with the aspirin at all um.
PATIENT: So right now I take, sometimes I take [REDACTED] pills when my back aches and then once I get up in the morning it hurts but after I walk for a while it'll go away excepting if I walk [REDACTED].  Like when I go shopping.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I get a burning sensation right here.
DOCTOR: Yeah and that's what.  When you lean over [REDACTED] push the cart does that make it feel a little better, does that help?
PATIENT: I hang on to them yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah and that's consistent with the spinal stenosis that we know you have.
PATIENT: And I can't stand in one place too long that's when it really burns.
DOCTOR: Right exactly and that's because when you're standing, around the spinal cord where the area is tight and then it really starts squeezing on that cord and it hurts, just like we're talking about the nerves up here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: The same thing with the nerves going through your legs um and you know, there's not great options with these things unfortunately.  You know we can do surgery um but right.
PATIENT: If I could, you know when I walk, it's always the same it's just that you know when I can't tolerate the pain then we might have to do an operation on it but I can live with it.  I've had it for a long time so.
DOCTOR: Alright so we'll try this medicine desipramine it's called okay.  Uh we'll just start with a really small dose, the lowest dose.  Just take one time at night.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Take it with the Tylenol.  It might make you a little sleepy, so I would definitely start you know just taking it before you go to bed and see how it makes you feel.
PATIENT: I can take it with Tylenol?
DOCTOR: You can take it with the Tylenol.
PATIENT: And an aspirin?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, no problem, definitely won't hurt with aspirin.
PATIENT: Cause I take one before I go to bed.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's perfect, you can take it together and um um and so it might make you a little sleepy.  Um it'll take a little while, a week or two probably before we would see any affect on the pain I think.  Because it takes a little time to build up in your system.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh but we'll see if it has any affect on this pain especially at night okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And we'll, you know it can be a little trial and error.  We'll see what works and what doesn't work.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And then I put in for them to reschedule the test.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay and I'll see you back in a couple months and we'll see how things are going.
PATIENT: Great.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: That's it.
PATIENT: Now I can report at the desk.
DOCTOR: No I'll do it all through the computer.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Good to see you.  Have a good holiday.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] you too.  Nice seeing you.
DOCTOR: Good luck to you.
