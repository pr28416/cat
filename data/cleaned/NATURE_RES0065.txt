DOCTOR: So what brings you into the family clinic today?

PATIENT: I think it's getting worse, yeah.
DOCTOR: And does it usually happen during the day, throughout the night or does it have any sort of pattern?

DOCTOR: OK. Alright, so yeah, overall it seems that you had this sore throat which is constant, getting worse and a bit of a fever in th last one or two days and you've also had swelling in your neck and so yeah, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, like what do you think I have? Do you think it's COVID?
DOCTOR: Yeah, so definitely at this time, you know whenever people have any respiratory symptoms we always want to rule out COVID.  So will definitely get a swab for COVID testing done for you today which should come back within 24 to 48 hours and in the meantime you should self isolate. And other than that, it can also be, due to this swelling in your lymph nodes and also just the other symptoms, it can be other viral infections. It can be mono so we definitely have to do a couple of tests, and there's one test that will do for mono as well which is called EBV antibody testing. So we'll do a couple of these tests today and then see what what comes back. And in the meantime you should definitely self isolate if you haven't been doing so already.
PATIENT: OK, sure I can do that.
DOCTOR: Yeah, do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, that sounds good. Thank you so much.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Take care.
PATIENT: You too.
