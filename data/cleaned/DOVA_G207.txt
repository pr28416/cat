DOCTOR: Patient?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: How you doing?
PATIENT: I'm surviving.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  And you had a hernia repair?
PATIENT: A while ago.
DOCTOR: In March?
PATIENT: Was that this year?
DOCTOR: Did they do a maxillary cyst or anything right here?
PATIENT: Well that's why I visited the oral surgeon who doesn't have surgery suite privileges.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Did all that under local, which was completely miserable.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: He pulled the tooth.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then went up into the sides that way and tried getting rid of everything.
DOCTOR: Did it work?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Prob one.
DOCTOR: Did you have it here?
PATIENT: It was done here.  He didn't send anything to Pathology so there's no Pathology Report.  He did it all under local and then the headaches came back.  They did a CT upstairs in Dental and said it's already come back; they needed to do it again.  I'm not doing that under local again.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now initially they'd written a referral to Loyola cause we didn't have an oral surgeon here.  Now we have an oral surgeon but he has no surgery privileges.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So somebody's got to do something cause I cannot do that under local again.  There's just no way in the world.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I don't know.  I've had you know when I initially got admitted to the hospital here.
DOCTOR: Were evaluated by him again?
PATIENT: I told them I wouldn't go back to him.
DOCTOR: Okay what you should do is actually not to have surgery by him but go back to him and say I will not do it under local anesthesia cause I think he is the one that's gonna have to refer you to Loyola.  Cause no matter what I do they're gonna be like well we have services offered at the VA so it's something that he will have to do.
PATIENT: Right but, I talked to him after he had removed it because he could feel it in the CT and he's like well because they got a CT, their own CT machine up there in Dental.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: He says I don't have surgery privileges.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's not my problem.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know but if I need something fixed and you can't fix it, he says well I can but under local.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So he's saying he's willing to fix it.  I'm saying it's not gonna happen.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because to go into my and there a little tube about yeah long that you know and this is a two hour procedure.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: My hernia repair didn't take that long.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So for him to take it cause there's actually a patch.
DOCTOR: So you were awake?
PATIENT: There is a, for the whole thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: There's a, they had.
DOCTOR: They didn't put you somewhat under?
PATIENT: No, he doesn't have privileges.
DOCTOR: Even for a wisdom tooth, they’ll put you a little bit under.
PATIENT: He doesn't have privileges.
DOCTOR: Is he new here?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Do you know if he has privileges now?
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don't know but, but I come in, you know he had to pull the one tooth.  The tooth had a root canal but there was so much pressure that's why I spent the week in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So that's when they did the referral to Loyola cause they didn't have a surgeon, then he came in after I already had been screened at Loyola but I went and checked when it could be done and they canceled it cause I came in with the papers, they canceled it because now we have an oral surgeon who doesn't have privileges.  So the headaches are back.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So that actually has four things.  The headaches are back which I had a prescription for Imitrex, I got a couple of those left.  Imitrex is taking care of the problem.  Was taking care of the pain but it's not addressing the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh in the follow-up CT that they did up in the Oral Surgery said its back.  Okay he, after you take something out of the body, common sense says you send it to Pathology and find out what the heck it is.  He never did that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Yeah.
PATIENT: You know that's doctor 101, you remove something you send it to Pathology.  So he never sent it to Pathology.  So we don't know what this even was.  But the follow-up CAT scan shows it's already returned.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So something is in there that shouldn't be yet we don't know what it is because he didn't do what he should of done.  Now if push comes to shove I'll use my health insurance to go outside and get it done and pay for civilians.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I understand okay.
PATIENT: But I shouldn't have to go see a civilian doctor because I have VA health care.
DOCTOR: Was it the left side that they did?
PATIENT: Uh-huh, yep.  You know but I shouldn't have to see a civilian doctor because this guy doesn't have operating room privileges.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Okay so that's one issue we need to address, so you want to find an oral surgeon, that's one issue.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: The headaches.
PATIENT: But the Imitrex does work for it.
DOCTOR: It works but we need to solve the problem.
PATIENT: Right I mean it's, we can't just so I'm gonna need a refill for the Imitrex.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just for that.  If we can get rid of the sinus problem or whatever is growing in there which we still don't know what.
DOCTOR: Are you still on the Imitrex [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I got one a while ago.  I don't even remember how long it was.  I keep all my prescriptions.
DOCTOR: Yeah you need, looks like you need a refill.
PATIENT: Who wrote one?
DOCTOR: Probably [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What um dose was it?
PATIENT: 50.
DOCTOR: 50 and how often were you taking it?
PATIENT: Oh, you know get nine in the box?  That could actually last me an entire year.
DOCTOR: Oh really okay.
PATIENT: But I've gone through two in the last three weeks.
DOCTOR: I'll write the, I'll give you a 30 day supply with like three refills okay.  So you should get 30 tablets.
PATIENT: Okay it comes in a specialty pill pack, there's nine pills in a package.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's almost like the uh, like the Steri-packs.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The same as that.  It's nine pill packs so that's how it's dispensed.  I might have got, maybe I got it through the ER I don't remember but it comes in a nine pill pack.
DOCTOR: Alright okay.  So we'll do I'll write if for a 90 day supply then okay and then we'll get you a refill alright.  [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: That works.
DOCTOR: Do you want it mailed or do you want to pick it up?
PATIENT: No I can pick it up, it's no big deal and now I see the knee guy today after you.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Who Rheumatology?
PATIENT: I saw the, I saw them.
DOCTOR: The rheumatologist?  Did they give you a steroid?
PATIENT: I saw them, they did a steroid.  He said before they can do the Synvisc injections, they gotta do the full steroid sets.  I'm like okay that's fine.
DOCTOR: But you don't see them until the 22nd.
PATIENT: But I saw the rheumatologist.
DOCTOR: It doesn't say you have anything here.
PATIENT: No, no, I go to Prosthesis.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Oh okay.
PATIENT: From here cause they've got the order to build the brace.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause they build that from scratch.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Supposedly.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Does that say where it’s at? The 5th floor of this building?
DOCTOR: Um it's either fifth floor here or fifth floor in 228.
PATIENT: That's at 228.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Alright so I gotta go see them um.
DOCTOR: And you got a steroid injection in your knee?
PATIENT: They did one in the knee.  He said before they can do the Synvisc injections cause they’re $600 a piece.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They can't give the Synvisc until they do all the steroid injections.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm like that's fine.
DOCTOR: Did it help at all?
PATIENT: Not even a little bit.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I knew that ahead of time.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.
PATIENT: Now also rheumatoid doctor.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Sent me to the podiatrist.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Who gave me this.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And ordered physical therapy, a block from the house so it's Mondays and Wednesdays.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Did that help?
PATIENT: VA covered eight visits.  Apparently the right leg is a whole lot weaker than the left leg but I already knew that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But they're working on that, trying to fix that up so that's going on.  They ordered eight visits so I don't know what happens after eight if they re-evaluate, if I go back and see the podiatrist or.
DOCTOR: They'll probably give you home exercises to do on your own at home.  That's probably what they're gonna do.
PATIENT: So there's that, okay so we got that and now the fun begins cause I have to keep track of what's what.  My 9-year-old gotta [REDACTED] picture now okay.  She is 88 pounds.  So if I go somewhere you know I've got to lift her up plus the chair.  On Father's Day she was in the livingroom and I've got this big long chair and I went to pick her up from there out of the chair, to put her into the wheelchair and she tensed up.  I did something to the back of my arm right here to where I can't bend it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I don't know if I tore a muscle, if I, I have no idea but I'm literally stuck with about two or three pounds lifting with this arm and other than that it's useless.
DOCTOR: With everything else.
PATIENT: So I know.
DOCTOR: Is it painful or is it weakness?
PATIENT: That's uh no it's extremely weak.
DOCTOR: But is it painful?
PATIENT: If I try and lift something, if I try to lift something it hurts right in here.
DOCTOR: Right there.
PATIENT: But I could push on it, it's not a big deal but if I try and actually lift something I just can't, so I don't know if I tore a muscle, if I chipped bone when she tensed up on me, I have no idea.
DOCTOR: When you go to Physical Therapy show this to them.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We'll do some x-rays today.
PATIENT: And they just drew my labs.
DOCTOR: Okay. So [REDACTED] were okay.
PATIENT: Now that hurts right here, just to do that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] okay.  How about this, now pull me towards you okay.  Push okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Does the shoulder hurt?
PATIENT: No it's just right, it's just there so I don't know if I tore a muscle when I lifted her.
DOCTOR: Um go like this, now push, strong, right.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That feels good.  But so it really just your forearm though not your [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah but like the pain is literally just right in the joint itself.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I don't know if I just tore a muscle in there or what I did but I went to pick her up and I tried cradling her and as soon as I had her up she just tensed out and it just you know the arm just went straight so I, but after that and on Father's Day there's you know but the muscle this or that went after a couple of weeks.
DOCTOR: So did you hit something?
PATIENT: No, no I went to lift her up and I was cradling here cause she's just rigid.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And as I lifted her up she tensed out, she actually forced the arm straight.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: From bent.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I kind of think I tore a muscle or something.  Okay elbow, knee brace, pain med headaces.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I wrote it down, I got it all.
DOCTOR: Good.  No trauma to the area other than what you said but you never hit it though?
PATIENT: No I didn't hit anything but like I said cause I had it cause I actually got down on my knees.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well on the one knee and I go underneath her and cradle her and then I you know lift her up from there and as soon as I had her off the couch that's when she just went rigid cause she was having a seizure and you know since she did that the arm just went straight so I don't know if it's just a torn muscle or what I did.  But it's just I mean complete weakness lifting.  You know I'll have to reach for the coffee can, then I drop the coffee can and I have to have my coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Of all your labs only one has come back and that one is all normal, your blood count's all normal.
PATIENT: Well that's a good thing.
DOCTOR: So we're just waiting on um your lipids, your cholesterol and then all of your electrolytes and the screening for diabetes and your cholesterol that we're still waiting on.
PATIENT: Yeah well I know my last A1c was a 5.3 which was nice.
DOCTOR: Yeah so it should be probably around the same um okay.  What are you using for pain control for your knee?
PATIENT: The uh.
DOCTOR: Tramadol?
PATIENT: Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Vicodin.
PATIENT: But I'm down to two pills.  After Physical Therapy cause I go there Mondays and Wednesday it's for a full hour and then at the end of the therapy then they ice it down.  By the time I get home it's rather uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: To say the least.  I walk in there with a little limp.  I walk out with a very pronounced limp.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Where’s 228?
DOCTOR: That's the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Can I get it from inside or I have to go outside to get that do I?
DOCTOR: You can that from inside um.
PATIENT: So they [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: It's not the ER Service two other [REDACTED].  Uh did you come into the ER today?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Okay so I would get your [REDACTED].  So let's go with this is the ER and this is the parking lot.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And you park near the ED.
PATIENT: Cause that's the Spinal Center right there.
DOCTOR: Yeah so hmm yeah.  So I know here's the hallway.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And then this is the elevator that you get on right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: When you come up so instead of turning here you keep on in this hallway so when you get out the elevator make a right and then there's a big junction here [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Then you want to make a left and then you'll see um towards the end of the hall you'll see um wood floors okay, you want to follow the wood floors.  If you go this way it's the Canteen, you don't want to go towards the Canteen.
PATIENT: Okay I understand.
DOCTOR: You go towards the Pharmacy, Outpatient Pharmacy.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: You want to go this way and then follow the corridor out and the entrance is over here.
PATIENT: Okay that works.
DOCTOR: So in relation to the whole hospital, this whole area is parking lot and here's Loyola.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But this right here is the entrance to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay, makes sense.
DOCTOR: And um we have [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so the big thing today is you have to, so I'm [REDACTED] your sinus issue [REDACTED] and your elbow right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay everything is being worked on and stuff is happening already.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: So we'll leave those aside and work on those two today.  Um.
PATIENT: If it's sinus what about just a referral back to ENT and let them deal with it?
DOCTOR: We can, you can do that cause ENT is probably going to be able to do surgery.  They can already do surgery.  You don't have to go to the dentist.
PATIENT: Right.  Cause I mean he removed the tooth.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Which it had a root canal cause that's what the whatever it was was pushing down on it.
DOCTOR: Why didn't ENT ever do it in the first place?
PATIENT: Because they said it required an oral surgeon to remove the tooth before they do anything.
DOCTOR: So the tooth was already out.
PATIENT: And now the tooth is out.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause he had [REDACTED] I had.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's what he took out so.  But if it's out now maybe they'll do their thing but.
DOCTOR: ENT is really good here.
PATIENT: You know it irritates me the fact that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] ENT at Hines is the same as Loyola.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And then it's one of the best programs.
PATIENT: But yeah it just irritates me the fact that he removed whatever this was and never sent anything to Pathology so we still have no clue what it is.
DOCTOR: Yes that's unfortunate.  Alright I'll be back okay and hopefully some of your labs will be back by then.
PATIENT: Okay can we refill all the meds?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Do you want to pick them up today?
PATIENT: Sure why not?  Cause I got to go to 228 so I'm gonna be walking not that far from the Pharmacy anyway so I'll go there, I'll go to the Pharmacy sign in and then I'll go to 228 get the knee brace then go back to the Pharmacy cause it'll take them a half hour to get it anyway.
DOCTOR: You need um do you use Naproxen at all?  The Naprosyn, Naproxen that's like ibuprofen.
PATIENT: Yeah I do.
DOCTOR: You do use it?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Do you use the omeprazole?
PATIENT: I haven't had a problem with the ulcer in over a year.
DOCTOR: This prevents you from getting the ulcer.
PATIENT: Yeah I know it's worse but.
DOCTOR: Um do you use Tramadol?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You do use tramadol.
PATIENT: I use that, I try and use that instead of the Vicodin but I don't take them both together.
DOCTOR: Do you use the Ambien?
PATIENT: Yes.  Yes cause if I can take, cause what I'll do is just if the knee gets really bad I'll take a Vicodin and if it's not that bad I'll take an Ambien and the tramadol or the Ambien and the Naprosyn.
DOCTOR: What about bowel regimen, the Docusate are you taking it?
PATIENT: No I get that over-the-counter.  No point getting a prescription for that and that's over-the-counter.
DOCTOR: And okay.
PATIENT: There's no inhaler on there is there?
DOCTOR: Uh uh.
PATIENT: That's such a good thing.
DOCTOR: Why?
PATIENT: Cause I haven't used it in who knows how long.  It's amazing how much better it is to breathe when you quit smoking.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah.
PATIENT: It's probably; it's got to be a year and a half since I've used one.
DOCTOR: Great.
PATIENT: You'd think me being a nurse I'd know better.  Well the order, cause I got a call last week.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That said hey you got, you know you got your check with your primary next week so we'll put you in for 7:30 for labs.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Just go down for the labs and blah blah blah.  I go downstairs and like we've got nothing for you, they showed an order for labs but it didn't say any specific labs.  So I go upstairs, check in with them, they don't open till 8, but check upstairs then they'll put the order in the computer then you can come back here and get it redrawn.  So I come up, I'll say quarter to 8.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I was supposed to be here at quarter to 8 and I sit until 8:30 before anybody even calls me cause I check in at the desk and its 8:30 or so, the nurse called me back to do my vitals and she was just like we'll just draw your labs now so they actually drew it up here.
DOCTOR: That's fine, that's okay.  I don't expect them to be back [REDACTED] do the blood so I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Can you um go like this?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Is that any problem for you?
PATIENT: It hurts.
DOCTOR: It does hurt.
PATIENT: It hurts, it hurts.  It just sort of sits back here in the joints.
DOCTOR: Right here.
PATIENT: Really in the joint yeah.
DOCTOR: Does it help if I.
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No this happened on Father's Day so June 18th that's what it is.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like your arm has gotten more atrophied?
PATIENT: No it's just, I can actually use it but I just can't you know if I try and lift her up, you know if I carry her up the stairs cause there's six stairs to her bedroom, you know I got to you know lift up like this.  I can feel it hurts in the joint but now I got a sore shoulder going up the stairs.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: 80:50   DOCTOR IN: 95:59
DOCTOR: Alright so instead of an x-ray we'll do MRI.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: X-rays might show a fracture but the MRI will show any ligament tear and I think that's what really happened if you're having weakness um so we'll do that.
PATIENT: Makes sense.
DOCTOR: And you have [REDACTED] passwords.
PATIENT: Hey now I've got the same thing on my work.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] goals.
PATIENT: I'm telling you, I'll tell you a secret now at my desk I've got so many programs that I actually have two monitors they're linked together and I'll have 10 programs at one time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I have one program to get into the computer.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I have one program to check my employees for VISTA stuff.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I have one third program for payroll, I made them all the same password so when you have to change your password put a number one at the end of it and then that day put a number two at the end of it and then that date put a number three at the end of it and just keep adding a number.
DOCTOR: Oh.  So my attending would like instead of adding a number just substitute the number but yeah same thing.
PATIENT: Yeah I don't so this one is the one, then it's now a two, then a three then a four.  I need to keep the same word, now I just keep the same word I just keep changing the numbers.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And once you get to ten you can recycle.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm not [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's not smart that's just I'm that lazy so if all I've got to do is add one number I'm good to go.
DOCTOR: Do you have any foreign metal in your body?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope it's all gone.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: There's nothing in there right now.
DOCTOR: Alright and we're gonna get you an Ortho consult cause Ortho may have to do something for the elbow.
PATIENT: Oh for the elbow.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know if I didn't have to pick her up so many different times a day the elbow would have had an adequate time to heal but being a single dad with a quadriplegic at home so it's not an option.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna say I want to see you in a month or so [REDACTED] in a month.  If I say within a week then they're gonna [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right yeah we want to do that.  Cause this happened Father's Day.  I thought it would've healed by now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: About six weeks later hmm
DOCTOR: And you've seen ENT in the past right?
PATIENT: They referred me to Oral Surgery because we didn't have an oral surgeon at the time.
DOCTOR: Because you have seen ENT you just have to make an appointment with them.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then they can do that out there so make sure you make that with them before you leave today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And I think that's all we need to do.
PATIENT: Yeah the EMT is the one that said you need to see Oral Surgery.
DOCTOR: For the tooth.
PATIENT: For.
DOCTOR: The tooth.
PATIENT: Which was an issue and then they're the ones that helped push it through because they didn't have an oral surgeon in house at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay and now all of your labs came back really good. No diabetes.  So for somebody without diabetes your LDL as long as it's under 130 its okay.  Yours is at 101.
PATIENT: Yeah that’s a good number.
DOCTOR: If for some reason you got diabetes or any other hypertriglyceridemia then we want that to be closer to 70.
PATIENT: So 181, HDL of 49.
DOCTOR: So this is your total cholesterol number that everyone talks about and then this is the bad cholesterol that you always want to keep an eye on okay.
PATIENT: And the VA’s guideline is 130?
DOCTOR: So nationwide if you don't have any medical problems at all 130 is the goal or less.
PATIENT: Oh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: If you have hypertension, high cholesterol, anything like that.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Then 100 is fine.  If you've got diabetes our goal is 70.  Excluding diabetes, diabetes is like the life expectancy of a patient with diabetes or just HIV in today's world, people with HIV have a normal life expectancy.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: People with diabetes don't.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So diabetes is like one of those things that everyone has but they don't realize how bad it is.
PATIENT: Well I know guidelines for the insurance industry it's totally separate.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause total of under 200 HDL is about 40, LDL is below of 100 and triglycerides below a 50.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So for your insurance [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: So.  Your LDL is 101.
PATIENT: I can deal with that.
DOCTOR: So yeah.
PATIENT: And you have to stay 130 for LDL huh?
DOCTOR: Um for no medical problems at all.  For you, other than your musculoskeletal issues.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You don't really have anything else and you're not taking any medications for high blood pressure or anything.
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: You're fine.
PATIENT: I love it.
DOCTOR: You're doing fine.
PATIENT: I love it.
DOCTOR: Keep it that way.
PATIENT: I love it.
DOCTOR: Cause if your diet stays the same now rather than 10 years from now your body's going to react to your diet very differently 10 years from now.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: So your body will not produce these numbers.
PATIENT: I'll take it while I can get it though.  I'll take [REDACTED] for a total.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: Cause the last time it was 201 so it's gone down.
DOCTOR: Um you're not due for a flu shot right now.
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Um okay you got the pneumonia.
PATIENT: So my cholesterol numbers went down, I like it.
DOCTOR: Yeah and.
PATIENT: The cholesterol went down, A1c is good, I haven't smoked in 3 1/2 years, yeah I'm not doing too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so take this and you can come back in another six months or a year.
PATIENT: Do it in six, I like to see you.
DOCTOR: Alright sounds good.  So make sure they make, they'll call you at this phone number, make sure you make the appointment for the next month out there.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I’m just irked that he never sent anything to Pathology when he should have.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's just wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes it is.
PATIENT: Thank you ma'am.
DOCTOR: Very good, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh yeah.  How long are you here, two years?  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I have one year left.
PATIENT: Okay.
