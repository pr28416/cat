DOCTOR: OK. Any recent travel?
PATIENT: Uh nope, I've been at home.
DOCTOR: OK. Um I think those are all the questions that I had for you, um did you have any questions of your own for myself?
PATIENT: Uh no, I was just wondering what this pain could be on my, in my elbow.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so right now it seems like you may have a case of something called um lateral epicondylitis. So, it's also known as uh tennis elbow, um and there are a lot of things that could kind of predispose you to this, um so it could be like the repetitive strain at work, um and like continuous contraction of your wrist extensor muscle group there. Um so for this we basically recommend um a couple of things to manage the pain. Uh but first, like in terms of imaging, I don't think it is necessary because it doesn't seem like there was any trauma and I'm not too worried about any fractures. Um so to help you treat this, um we recommend some activity modifications, so um at work not doing things that are too repetitive, especially if it's using those um extensor forearm muscles. Um and then you can use some, use a compression sleeve as well, continue taking Tylenol or NSAIDs for the pain and uh really important is physical therapy um to increase mobility and strength in that arm. Uh and as well you can apply things like ice um to it for like the pain and swelling if you see any. Uh, yeah, so it should resolve in about six months to two years at most, uh but normally it does um go away in a couple of months with some physical therapy and the compression and splints if you choose to do that. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, that that sounds um good, thank you.
DOCTOR: Yeah, no worries.
