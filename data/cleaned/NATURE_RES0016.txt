DOCTOR: OK, the cough and breathlessness both started two years ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, I would say approximately around the same time.
DOCTOR: OK, OK. Um, do you always have the breathlessness, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Um, I think it's, I feel short of breath most of the times, but it's mainly just gets worse when I'm exerting myself when I'm walking more than usual or just working in the garden.
DOCTOR: OK, OK, um and same thing with the cough? It gets worse when you're walking around?

DOCTOR: OK, and, does anything make it worse or better besides the exertion?
PATIENT: Uh, no, I think that's pretty much the only thing that really makes it worse.
DOCTOR: OK, and how would you describe your breathlessness? Is it that you're breathing too fast or you can't catch your breath?

DOCTOR: OK, and has anyone around you been sick?
PATIENT: No, not that I know.
DOCTOR: No um, and have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, No.
DOCTOR: OK, um, have you been worked up for this in the past two years? Like have you had any chest X-rays or pulmonary function tests or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I've never really had this issue before, so no investigations.
DOCTOR: OK, OK, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have anything that you wanted to add that I maybe missed?
PATIENT: Uh, no, I just it's been going on for two years and I feel like it's getting worse and worse. And yeah, I'm just scared of having to, you know, go on oxygen or like just not being able to breathe at one point.
DOCTOR: Yeah, for sure. So we will try to do a good job working you up for everything that we think it may be. And right now, it sounds like it could be pulmonary fibrosis either like you know an autoimmune process or triggered after like an infection that you may have had in the past. We will definitely also look into see if it's perhaps a lung cancer, asthma and you mentioned you don't smoke so we don't think it could be COPD but we'll also test for that in case all everything else comes back negative.
PATIENT: OK, sounds good. Thank you so much.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Take care you too.
