DOCTOR: OK. Alright, yeah, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all for me?
PATIENT: Uh, no, what was like, what do you think I have?
DOCTOR: Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?
PATIENT: No, I haven't.
DOCTOR: OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that? Have you measured your temperature?
PATIENT: I haven't, I haven't, no.
DOCTOR: OK.
PATIENT: I don't feel hot though.
DOCTOR: OK, since it's been three days, what I'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so Amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel. And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah that sounds great. Thank you.
DOCTOR: OK, you're welcome and hopefully you feel better.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Take care.
PATIENT: You too.
