DOCTOR: Oh.
SECOND PERSON L682
But it's still like its real almost irritated or something, you know real red, you know like cherry red.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON L682
So I don't, but we haven't seen any of the um, like it was getting like a blister, like a blood blister, we don't see anything like that there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON L682
But it is getting that very red, cherry red spotting all over the membrane part.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
SECOND PERSON L682
And uh, he we’re getting tired of this, so um.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON L682
So he has to be abstaining so this is not good for us at this age.
DOCTOR: I understand.

SECOND PERSON L682
It’s worse than being young at 16.
PATIENT: I told her if I was still a young guy.
SECOND PERSON L682
This wouldn’t happen.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON L682
It just wouldn't happen.
PATIENT: We got bigger problems.
DOCTOR: Alright [REDACTED]
SECOND PERSON L682
This is not going over real good.
DOCTOR: I don't [REDACTED] I’m glad you’re giving him some problems, that's a good thing.
SECOND PERSON L682
Well yeah but it's working on our nerves now.
PATIENT: (Laughter)
DOCTOR: Sure, sure.  You got it, alright so we need to take a look.  Let me grab some gloves, just have a seat here.  Everything else okay?
SECOND PERSON L682
Uh yes but other than some of the prescriptions.
DOCTOR: Need refills?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I thought I refilled them all?
SECOND PERSON L682
Uh well I went to Sam’s Club and they told us that that was the last one and then she never gave the one for the simvastatin and um I'm having a problem on the telephone for this hydrochlorothiazide for here.  Every time we call they say that it's on hold.  Why I don't know yeah and why I don't know because we're supposed to be able to get three refills and I'm down to two weeks is all I got left and then I'm out.
PATIENT: That [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I don't know why they put it on hold.
SECOND PERSON L682
But I, you know it's like as if you’re supposed to clear it or or something and I don't understand that because you're supposed to be able to get three more refills on it.  And that's one of his blood pressure medications so.
DOCTOR: I don't know why this is on hold.  And he's taking a half tablet currently?
SECOND PERSON L682
Yep.  25 mg 1/2 tablet yeah.
DOCTOR: Well, I'll just refill create a new one.  90 days supply right?
SECOND PERSON L682
Yes.
DOCTOR: You want me to mail it or do you want to pick it up today?
SECOND PERSON L682
Uh why don't we pick it up today because like I said there's only two weeks left and I don't want to have no problems so.
DOCTOR: Alright.
SECOND PERSON L682
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] again.
SECOND PERSON L682
Yeah, if there's no rush [REDACTED].
PATIENT: One other thing I wanted to ask you before we leave too is about the fact it feels like there's something in there sometimes but it waters a lot but something, it doesn't always feel like there's sometimes in there when it does but sometimes.
SECOND PERSON L682
Well yeah explain to him that it's mostly when you're watching.
PATIENT: Actually it might be strain, I don't know.
SECOND PERSON L682
Okay.
PATIENT: But it feels like there's something in here sometimes, I thought I might be redeveloping a sty because I had a sty before but that doesn't.
DOCTOR: Is it grainy and scratchy?
PATIENT: It's always running.  Not always but kinda almost like it's always running.
SECOND PERSON L682
His eye is always tearing.
DOCTOR: This sensation you're having does it feel like there's a piece of sand in there or something?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah it feels like I had a sty before and I know what it feels like and it's like there's something rubbing in that spot.
SECOND PERSON L682
Does it feel like up under the eyelid or what?
PATIENT: It feels like it's on the eye itself but I don't know.
DOCTOR: I don’t see anything.
PATIENT: You know I don't think I've got a sty cause you know I've had it before I know what it looks like but it just feels like once in a while like there's something there.  It's always in the same spot and this eye and it's probably eye strain but sometimes and it runs and runs and runs and it just looks like I'm crying like hell it runs so bad.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  There's nothing I can see today.  You can get little viral infections in the eye so you can even get a little bit of exudate, a little crustiness there.
SECOND PERSON L682
No I don't notice anything like that.
PATIENT: No, like I said this has been doing this for what at least a year now off and on.
SECOND PERSON L682
If he gets in the wind right away it generally does that.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] since I was a kid.
SECOND PERSON L682
He'll actually just cry, cry, cry.
DOCTOR: Yeah mine does that.
SECOND PERSON L682
He does it,bright sunlight he starts getting the waters right away um.
DOCTOR: Yeah I don't know, um it may you could get some drops, some rehydrating drops.  What happens when you watch TV and like the wind blowing, it's essentially drying out so your eye may be over-reacting to it being dry so it's dumping the tears out to just rehydrate your eye.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You could try, you know getting a little thing of saline, so that has medication in it and if you’re going to sit down and watch TV just put some drops in and see if that makes any difference.  I'm just shooting in the dark here.
SECOND PERSON L682
Yeah.
PATIENT: I don’t know if it’s the strain thing you know cause just now, I was just sitting out there now, ain't watching any TV or anything but all of a sudden it just started running.
SECOND PERSON L682
The lights.
PATIENT: Yeah maybe it's the lights.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  If it gets any worse or there's a problem we can have Ophthalmology take a look but he's probably not going to see anything, you know just based on what I can see here at this point.
PATIENT: It's probably that the eye strain and also the lights are too bright for my eyes or something.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
SECOND PERSON L682
He's got eyes that won’t…
PATIENT: [REDACTED] curiosity.
SECOND PERSON L682
[REDACTED] very touchy eyes.
DOCTOR: Still the same and actually it's redder than the last time I saw it.  We still with the exudate there.  Okay.
SECOND PERSON L682
Well actually that looks like a blister is there.  The skin is coming off there.
DOCTOR: Is it painful.
PATIENT: No uh uh.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Okay so it feels a lot better than it did the last time.  Now you're not having a problem pushing the foreskin back.
SECOND PERSON L682
Yeah but it still don't look good.
PATIENT: Last time I was really having a lot of trouble pushing the foreskin.
SECOND PERSON L682
But it's in that mucous-like.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
SECOND PERSON L682
Secretion like now and he's getting it in the underwear so um.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON L682
And he didn't notice that before so now he's noticing that so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON L682
Otherwise he ain't touching else [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  And you're washing every day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Alright well you did the first round of [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON L682
He did that one and do it again.
DOCTOR: I'm going to go talk to my boss to see if he has any suggestions.  I'd hate to have to send you to a urologist.  I think we can handle it here.  Let me step out, I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
(DOCTOR OUT:  49:21  DOCTOR IN:  51:55)
DOCTOR: Alright.  You [REDACTED]
SECOND PERSON L682
Oh good.  And by the way I took him off of [REDACTED].  He took that pill for about a week [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh was he getting anti-fungal [REDACTED].  He took the one dose [REDACTED] that's fine.
SECOND PERSON L682
But then I put him back on it.
PATIENT: After a period of time yeah.
DOCTOR: Sounds good.
PATIENT: After a week and a half.
DOCTOR: We got two doctors here.
SECOND PERSON L682
Yeah.
PATIENT: Her whole family are doctors.
DOCTOR: I'm going to call her for a consult.
PATIENT: Her whole family is doctors.
SECOND PERSON L682
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Every one of them they prescribe for each other. They pass medicine around.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The little drug ring they have.
DOCTOR: Alright so I talked to DOCTOR and he wants to do another treatment with the tablets, the anti-fungal.  But also wants you to go see the urologist and he makes a good point, one is if you don't respond to this next dose then there may be something we need to change or something more serious to investigate one being the urologist might recommend that you need a circumcision.   Which could eliminate it.
PATIENT: Nothing like being [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um and then uh.
SECOND PERSON L682
I'm still fighting my [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Whatever it is, it's strong whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
SECOND PERSON L682
Cause she put me on three weeks at a time.  I have two doses at three weeks at a time and um I'm not taking them cause I don't need it for that reason and uh she's also got me using outside powder that you use for athlete's feet.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON L682
And she's also got me using a more expensive powder which doesn't work and I'm still fighting it and this has been since October and I spray two times a day and stuff and I still got it.  It's not as bad but I still got it and I see her tomorrow for this.  She was giving me 200 mg a day of the same pill, that's two pills [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] fluconazole.
SECOND PERSON L682
Yeah she was giving me that, two pills which is 100 mg, so 200 mg a day for three weeks and then there was a five week period between there and then she gave me another dose for three weeks and like I said I'm still fighting it so.  Whatever it is is very in there.  It doesn't want to die.
PATIENT: Yeah it's just, just a lot better and then all of a sudden boom, like back [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON L682
Uh-huh.  And I have to talk to her about mine tomorrow.  It's a lot better but it's still not gone.  It's just hanging in there.  And you know we're monogamous because it's something, it's not, I mean we don't think it's anything that you know, whatever in that area.
DOCTOR: Okay, I put in the consult.
SECOND PERSON L682
I mean I don't know, not being a doctor, I don't know if there's another one that's stronger than that yeast infection, whatever you call it, whatever it is.  I don't know if there's a higher one than that or whatever, but it's just a pretty strong one.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it should be okay um.  So we'll give you that one tablet again okay.  Now you want to pick it up at the window?
SECOND PERSON L682
Yeah.  As long as we're going to the window we might as well get it now.

SECOND PERSON L682
See they forgot you on the first one; see I told you that was.
DOCTOR: Yeah you're right, we got it down.  Alright so
SECOND PERSON L682
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I put in the consult, I put in the medications.  Um she did say the thing we want to investigate since it didn't respond is whether or not it's going to be better to just do foreskin separation or whether or not there's anything more serious that they want to investigate.  The reason why I'm having them see you is because they see this more often and so they'll say you know what this is suspicious for something more concerning or whether or not they want to biopsy or whether they want to say um let's do a further work-up.
SECOND PERSON L682
Well we can't see the foreskin [REDACTED] cause that’s what that’s from.
DOCTOR: Right.
SECOND PERSON L682
[REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Right.  I don't think.
SECOND PERSON L682
And the foreskin will turn him off because he does not like pain.
DOCTOR: Well I don't blame him.
SECOND PERSON L682
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm working for 67.
DOCTOR: I don't blame you.  It hasn’t been an issue, um and that's why she probably wants you to see them.  It's just an issue that's not been getting any better.
SECOND PERSON L682
Well we think it's just something else besides the foreskin.
PATIENT: Cause I've never had no problem with it.
SECOND PERSON L682
He's never had no problems with anything until now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON L682
You know you tell me it's an old age thing, I just don't think so.
DOCTOR: It could be a sugar issue.
SECOND PERSON L682
Oh really.
DOCTOR: If you were a diabetic then I would be, I would say just to leave because you're closer [REDACTED] but you're not diabetic.
SECOND PERSON L682
No.  Not that we can see.
DOCTOR: Alright we'll try again and I think if they have anything to offer it'd be worth hearing.
SECOND PERSON L682
Um when do we see you again?
DOCTOR: Oh let's see you can come back and see me in six months unless you have something else to.
SECOND PERSON L682
Well we can't, yeah we're going to have to talk to you about his knee.  We can't [REDACTED] that until this.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED] get the approval from you so [REDACTED].
