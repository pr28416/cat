PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: And you’re using the muscles on the outside of the ankle.

PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: So I mean, you're almost there and you're not on a ton of meds so.
PATIENT: Right.

DOCTOR: Okay.  It should be here.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's still a little high.
PATIENT: Oh they did it already?
DOCTOR: Yep.  So we might need to uh, let's see.  Are you taking the um simvastatin, you're taking it?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you're taking the niacin.
PATIENT: Niacin.  I may be slacking on that one a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay try and take it daily so I don't have to.
PATIENT: Okay.
SECOND PERSON C996
One time when I took that stuff.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON C996
And I got me burning and burning and my skin's on fire.
DOCTOR: You can take something for that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You can take a Benadryl or using an aspirin before you take it.
SECOND PERSON C996
Right.
DOCTOR: So you take aspirin anyway right?
SECOND PERSON C996
Right.
DOCTOR: Baby aspirin at night like when you're going to take the niacin.  So take the aspirin a little before you take that pill.
PATIENT: Oh okay, like 81 mg.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON C996
Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So if you take that before it should help. So when you take the aspirin.
PATIENT: That scared the shit out of me.
PATIENT: Right and I like to know, hearing these reports about this is outside a little bit of the norm, about testosterone.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: So um now um I was been on the computer and found that.  Like I don't seem like I don't want my, you have to want desire for sex or whatever.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that's one of the reason low testosterone.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Is there a test for that?
DOCTOR: There is but it's something I don't like to check because I'll tell you the reason because giving testosterone has it’s own risk, it hurts your liver you know.
PATIENT: Oh really.
DOCTOR: It can do a lot of different things.  It changes your sugar levels.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: It'll do [REDACTED]muscle mass at the same time, so like the prostate.  So if you're older obviously there's an increased risk of prostate cancer.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think it's probably good that they advertise and we don't know who really has benefit.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So I don't recommend it unless like you're getting really fatigued, it's like maybe you know it's like you're getting more like your hair like on the arms falling out.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You're developing breasts then I would think oh you don't have testosterone you know.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: But like I think in general you know for low energy I wouldn't recommend it because of it’s more risks than benefits.
PATIENT: Cause that's just a bunch of hype.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean we could check it but even if it was low and unless it was really low...
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: There’s no benefit.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know, it would have to be super low.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I would be, I mean it's something we can look into.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I mean as you get older, you lose a little bit of desire.  Do you have any trouble getting erections or anything?
PATIENT: Uh, kind of, sort of.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, sometimes.
PATIENT: Sometimes it still works, sometime it don't.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well then we'll do something.
PATIENT: Yeah I got a wife that's 10 years younger than me so she [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: She wants you to do well.  Unterstandable.
PATIENT: That's alright.  I think it's um we'll have to get her a toy.  Hey whatever does it?  Right.
DOCTOR: But I guess the question is you know is there anything else that could be contributing and like how's your sleep been?
PATIENT: Uh that's kind of shitty at times.
DOCTOR: What happens? Do you wake up?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you think you snore or you wake up short of breath or anything?
SECOND PERSON C996
No.
PATIENT: I goes to bed 9-9:30, go to sleep and I wake up.  If I don't take a Advil P.M. I wake up like 2 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Why are you waking up?  What's going on?
PATIENT: I don't know.  I just wake up.
DOCTOR: Are you tired [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON C996
No, uh uh.  I just wake up. I don’t know why.
PATIENT: What.
DOCTOR: Huh.  Can you go back to sleep?
PATIENT: Yeah maybe after a while I go back to sleep.
DOCTOR: Are you tired during the day?
PATIENT: No I don't really do shit.  It's just that I wake up, I don't know why.
DOCTOR: I don't know why either yeah.
PATIENT: I wake up, I'm thinking on things that are important you know, crazy.
DOCTOR: Have been anxious?
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: Have you been anxious?
PATIENT: Sometimes I do get a little anxious.
DOCTOR: With worries about what?  Any in general?
PATIENT: No, just thinking about overall affairs.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Just you know crazy shit.  How's the money going to last you know, I know, you know like and if I take an Advil P.M. I sleep good.
DOCTOR: I don't recommend probably continuing to do that.
PATIENT: Why?
DOCTOR: You know when you can.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Now all we're going is [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: If you feel like you're gonna wake up or you're having trouble, just take it before you go to bed.
PATIENT: It's like a half a pill you know.
DOCTOR: Good you know I mean I think it's real easy but I can give you a different medicine that might help with your erection problem.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And if you feel maybe, you know another thing I think having a younger lady, do you feel pressure?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any pressure to like perform?
PATIENT: No she's understanding.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You know, sometimes that can play a part. You get worked up and you want to do it and when you want to do it so bad you can't.
PATIENT: I know sometimes when I see her cycle.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: She's going through menopause.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Man she can get real crazy.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The least little things, you know upset her, you know.  A guess women are like that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I think around menopause is probably the worst.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Cause the woman knows what's happening. Those hormones.
PATIENT: Do men go through menopause?
SECOND PERSON C996
Not really um.
DOCTOR: Your testosterone goes kind of go slowly.  It's not like how you where you just shut off.
SECOND PERSON C996
Right, right.
DOCTOR: Like a slow drop so over time you know notice obviously testosterone is [REDACTED] talking about.
SECOND PERSON C996
Right, right.
DOCTOR: Not really, unless you're, testicles totally fails and generally when it fails you gotta go to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right okay.  Yeah I guess I just have to, [REDACTED], live off the memories.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well you know it's something I would think about checking from.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: If you really want, if you're really concerned about, how often can you get an erection?  Do you wake up with erections?
PATIENT: No not really.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: I don't know even [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No, not anymore.
PATIENT: That's what I say is it supposed to drop like that?
DOCTOR: How quickly did it fall off, I mean fall away?
PATIENT: Um gradually.
DOCTOR: Like all the time?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Well I think you know, part of that is getting the diabetes under control.
PATIENT: Right.
SECOND PERSON C996
Yeah.
PATIENT: The medicines.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Now that your sugars are getting pretty good.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I think that's gonna help.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And now the blood pressures even looks a little better. So that’s going to help.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So the only thing that I would say that I think will help rather than the testosterone is you know getting around and like walking.
PATIENT: Exercising.
DOCTOR: Get the blood flowing.  The biggest problem is the blood flow.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: I doubt if its testosterone but you don’t look like a guy who is short on testosterone.
PATIENT: Yeah okay doc.
DOCTOR: I knew you did.  So I wouldn't worry about it.
PATIENT: Right okay.
DOCTOR: So I think you'll be okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Get moving.  Anything that cleans out the blood vessels is good.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And get the blood flowing.
PATIENT: Okay.  I know I went out of town and I work, you know, I was enclosing my back porch and  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I worked every day. And I felt better. I got sore afterwards. After working you know so heart rate and all of that, I started feeling better though.  So I got to start exercising.
DOCTOR: You need to do that.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: It’s all you got to do it then.
PATIENT: Right, okay.
DOCTOR: So maybe that's the main thing.  I don't think you have any medications that are causing a problem and I'm just looking here.  Yeah you don't have any medications that should interfere.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That would be another thing I'd check.
PATIENT: Don't the water pills do that?  The water pill?
DOCTOR: Not really. They shouldn't.  Everything else looks good.
SECOND PERSON C996
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I need to do a quick exam on you and you already got all your labs done.  They look obviously the cholesterol is still a little high.  Not where I want to see the bad cholesterol, the 128.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I want that under 100 but if you take the niacin.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: That might help.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just take the aspirin before.  Cholesterol's okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Not where we want it to be, it's just a little high triglycerides but that will go down when the diabetes is under better and better control, these are going to get better so.  [REDACTED] before and your blood looks fine, nothing here that’s worrisome.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that's about it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let me do a quick exam on you.  I'll go talk with the other doc and we'll get you out of here.  Do you need anything else?

PATIENT: And that aspirin won't let me get the burns huh?
DOCTOR: It'll help.  If it doesn't work we can try a full dose aspirin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The 325 and you can try that and that should help prevent it at least.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Either that and if that doesn't work Benadryl.
PATIENT: Oh Benadryl.
DOCTOR: Yeah sometimes that works.  That's what's in the Tylenol P.M. anyway.

DOCTOR: You take the niacin and you stop the simvastatin.
PATIENT: Okay.
