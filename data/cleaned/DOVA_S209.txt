(DOCTOR OUT:  11:54  DOCTOR IN:  22:09)
DOCTOR: So you're saying you take the gout pills twice a month and you just take one pill twice a month?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Then what?
PATIENT: They changed it back to three.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Three pills.
DOCTOR: And that takes care of it when you have a gout attack?
PATIENT: It supposed, come sometimes it cools it off.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But it didn't stop it all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And have you ever been on a medicine that you take every day to help prevent gout attacks?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Um because there's a medicine called allopurinol that you can take one pill every day and it's supposed to help decrease the amount of uric acid in your body and uric acid is what causes gout attacks.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Would you like to start that pill to take to help prevent the gout attacks?  It’s one pill once a day and it helps your kidneys get rid of some of that extra uric acid in the body and that uric acid is what gets in your joints and can cause the gout flares.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But it is one more pill you'd have to take every day.  It's not just the pill that you take when you have the gout attack.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It something you take every single day.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay and you want to pick it up today?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: I want the magnesium.
DOCTOR: And the magnesium also.

PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And let me go through all your other medicines and make sure you have enough refills left so you can call for it.  Okay.  Okay so it'll be at the Pharmacy.

DOCTOR: And you don't need the shot.  You don't need a tetanus shot because you had one in 2003.
PATIENT: Okay oh.
DOCTOR: Okay so you got the tetanus shot, just eight years ago and you don't need a booster.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: So you're gonna continue all your medicines and start this new one.  It's called allopurinol.
