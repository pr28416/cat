DOCTOR: PATIENT?  Hello.
PATIENT: How you doing?
DOCTOR: Good.  How you doing?
PATIENT: Good.  Good as can be.
DOCTOR: So it uh seems you've had some action.
PATIENT: Oh yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Recently huh.
PATIENT: Yeah I had the stones busted up.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I must of had them a long time and just never knew it.
DOCTOR: Yeah usually you'll have them until they get to a certain size then they you know of course cause you pain.
PATIENT: Well the last couple of months, around I don't know how long but uh I would get blood in my urine once in a while, then it'd go away so I didn't pay any attention to it you know and then I went on a trip and I felt real weak and I was having back pains you know and I thought I must have sprained my back or did something you know and then when I got home it really hurt and the rest is history.  I'm still having the problem.  You know when I urinate I still get this burning sensation now I don't know if it's from the stent that's still in there or what and uh I still got this prostate thing driving me nuts.  I have no time to get to the bathroom you know.
DOCTOR: You just keep going, going, going?
PATIENT: No it's not that, it's when I got to go, I got to go, like I got 15 seconds to find a can somewhere, otherwise I'm whizzing in my pants you know and uh that's starting to be real irritable.  I take those pills, those tomazapins or whatever they are.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it seems like they ain’t shrinking them or whatever. I was talking to a friend of mine.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He was in the Marine Corps and uh he just found out he's got prostate cancer.  He had a removal.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: He had it so bad.
DOCTOR: Well it doesn't look like you're on anything for your prostate.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Terazosin.
DOCTOR: The terazosin?
PATIENT: Terazosin yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, yeah [REDACTED].  There's another one we can use that actually treats the prostate.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: As far as prostate cancer goes um we've been checking your PSA.
PATIENT: Well he told me his PSA was always good and then I don't know what the problem was, it developed into you know a little more and he had cancer throughout his entire prostate and he had it removed, got to take it out you know so I thought the PSA test was.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's rapid.  Even if it's normal, if it increases by, if it doubles.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It's supposed to be normal, let's say it was 1 and then it goes up to 2 then uh you know you get alarmed about it but yours has always been 0.76, you know maybe 0.87 so we're not concerned.
PATIENT: No he did tell me that, he was at 1 point something then it shot up to 3.
DOCTOR: Yeah even when it's normal it's still a big increase that we'd be concerned.
PATIENT: Yeah okay good then I don't have to worry about that.
DOCTOR: Yeah and we'll check it again this year.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: But uh my uh my big thing is that it's just holding my urine back you know till I get to the bathroom.  Uh sometimes when I do go I've got a very weak flow you know.  Sometimes associated with a little bit of pain you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause I got to go so bad  [REDACTED] pants [REDACTED] start to get my drill out and I dribble out a little bit out.
DOCTOR: Did they initially put a catheter in there?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is that out now?
PATIENT: Yeah that was out.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The catheter was only in there for one day.
DOCTOR: For one day okay.
PATIENT: And when they took that thing out [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Relief, huh?.
PATIENT: I had catheters from before but this one was worse than any of them.  I felt bad for the nurse I started pissing all over the place you know.
DOCTOR: How's your sugar doing?
PATIENT: Actually I'm gonna tell you, to be honest with you, since I had this kidney stone removal.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: My sugar has dropped down quite a bit.
DOCTOR: You check it like in the morning?
PATIENT: I check it in the morning and the evening.
DOCTOR: What is it usually in the morning?
PATIENT: The mornings are a little bit on the high side around 180.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But the last couple of weeks, since I've had this done the evenings are from anywhere from 70-130 which is pretty good for me.
DOCTOR: Yeah, sounds like its pretty good.  Sounds better.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, you know especially in the evening before I go to bed I check it I'm in the 120 you know.  Usually in the range of 100-120.  Every so often I'll be at 70 or 80 but, it's a lot better than it was you know months ago.
DOCTOR: Good.  Well we checked that test to see where it stands, that hemoglobin A1c.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That three months tests that we got [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That one, yeah we want less than 7; you got 8.5 the last time.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So, this is you  here.  When I got to you it was 10.7.  You've got it down to 6.7 which is under 7 but then something, I don’t know what happened but it's coming back up so hopefully now we can get it, get it controlled.
PATIENT: Well I already had a bypass surgery.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: See I've been having a lot of stress like for a while you know.  Basically mainly this year.
DOCTOR: Is your daughter living with you?
PATIENT: No.  She's moved out.  She got her own place now.
DOCTOR: Well.
PATIENT: She had lost her job and everything was going bad for her then things started going bad for me you know cause now I got put up with three little kids running around and I mean stuff like that I have no place to hide you know.  Then with the kidney stones you know I have more stress and pain and I think that's my sugar is jumping all over the place.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: If definitely can be. Um I'm going ask you a question, [REDACTED].  Um.
PATIENT: It depends what it is.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You need to be truthful with me, you know [REDACTED].  I'm not [REDACTED] or anything but uh you uh you had a urine test.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: In February.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It tested positive for cocaine.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Can you tell me anything about it?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah, once in a while I do it you know.  I don't even know why, I get together with a couple of guys and you know have a beer or two.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke it or snort it?
PATIENT: No no I snort it, if I do it at all.  It's just, it don't bother me and once in a while I just do it you know.
DOCTOR: The thing is that it tested positive for marijuana too, that's, more okay with that.  Was the cocaine just because you do have the heart you know issues, you know with that past surgery stuff.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Cause a lot of guys, [REDACTED] get a heart attack from the cocaine.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I don't want you to [REDACTED] I prefer that you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You really want to uh you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Marijuana, that's whatever but the cocaine I would try not to.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Cause I don't want you showing up with a heart attack.  If you weren't you know, you have the heart issues to begin with and you're diabetic and.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's not the best you know thing for you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: As far as, you know you can cause a lot of damage.
PATIENT: You know I had been using, I would take it, I just happened to do it that week you know.
DOCTOR: Well I appreciate you being honest with me.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I'm 64 years old.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: My lying days are over.  When I was much younger, I have a lot of problems with everything you know.  I got a problem with life, until I found out what my problem was.
DOCTOR: Otherwise your mood is okay, everything is good?
PATIENT: Yeah for the most part.  For the most part yeah, especially lately I just was feeling real good you know.
DOCTOR: Good.  And uh how much Lantus are you taking now, your insulin?
PATIENT: Lantus uh I'm taking like every evening around 25 units.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I'm thinking the way I'm going.
DOCTOR: Do you still have some of it?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.  I have one more bottle of it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It looks like somehow [REDACTED] messed up your medications [REDACTED]  Otherwise did you take your blood pressure pills this morning?
PATIENT: No, I forgot all my medications.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I was driving halfway here and I had it on the countertop so I wouldn't forget it and I just forgot it.  Normally I take it around 7 a.m. or so.
DOCTOR: Yeah your blood pressure.
PATIENT: It was a little high yeah.
DOCTOR: A little high.
PATIENT: But usually once I take my meds.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I check my blood pressure and I'm right on the money.
DOCTOR: You're on the money.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Like I said the sugars at the end of the day, before I go to bed I check it and uh the last couple of weeks I've been very happy with it. The day I went in with the stones [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh I came in and my sugar was like 300.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah it was real high.  But after they did the stones, I dropped down to 114.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And they couldn't figure out and neither could I you know.  Like maybe [REDACTED] sugar off you know.
DOCTOR: You know any stress on the body like you said.
PATIENT: Well that's you know, I've been like I said, the last couple of months I've been under a lot of stress and it's been causing a little havoc – my sleep [REDACTED].  [REDACTED] that sleep apnea machine, you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I turned that thing in, I just cannot use it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: All it does it uh I wake up about two hours after using it and my mouth is so dry it feels like my throat is sticking shut and that’s with the humidifier, I’m using that. [REDACTED] and I've had that thing a long time and I have yet to get a full night's sleep out of it you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I just kind of brought it back and told them look I can't use this thing.  You know. It does me more damage than good.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He says well you got to try it for a while.  I said I've had two years or so.
DOCTOR: You don't feel like it's worked for you at all?  Have you talked to the breathing people upstairs?
PATIENT: Uh I think I talked to them once about it and they said well you got get used it and this and that.  Oh yeah then I was supposed see DOCTOR, the neurologist, what’s her name – a Korean lady [REDACTED].  Yeah.  I don't know but the last time I went to see her I really got pissed off.  I got there; I had a 3:30 appointment, so I get there a little early.  I sat there and I'm watching everybody get up and get served and it's like almost 5 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And there's me and another guy that walked in about 45 minutes you know after me and she calls him and tells me I'm next.  I looked at my watch and I said I'm next, its 5 o'clock already.  I just got pissed off and got up and left you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: I couldn't stand sitting there no more.  I mean I know doctors are busy and they're gonna be late but for Christ's sake I was sitting there for almost two hours and some guy walks in later than me and she takes her in.
DOCTOR: Doesn’t make sense.
PATIENT: What am I chopped liver?  So I just got up and left and I haven't nothing else.  All I ever do with her is I'm in and out of her office ten minutes but tells me the same thing [REDACTED].  She could have called me up and told me that.
DOCTOR: True.
PATIENT: But otherwise you know like I said, my biggest beef right now is my prostate that's you know, I've been having trouble with it for quite a while now.  It's starting to get to the point where I got to watch when I go out and how long it takes you know.  Then I got to carry a big milk bottle around in case I got to pee, I just pull over cause I just can't hold it.
DOCTOR: Well what does the finasteride do.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: You're on another medication.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  It's supposed to help shrink your prostate.
PATIENT: Yeah cause it's just terrible and like I said the flow in the morning is really [REDACTED].  It's like I’m 90 years old.  But on April 2nd I got to come back for my, for the kidney stones and they're gonna check them out.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: See there was one more big one or one more lodged in my kidney and I guess they couldn't keep on blasting them because the kidney only takes so much but I was checking my urine with the screen and I don't know if passed, the whole passed or not.  I had some good-sized chunks come out.  Boy did that hurt, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Do you feel like [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I hang on to the wall and I looked in the mirror while I'm making these animal faces from the pain you know but the pain has subsided a lot.  You know I still have a little bit of burning sensation and I can handle it but I [REDACTED] with the catheter or what you know.
DOCTOR: Have you had an eye exam recently?
PATIENT: No I'm about due for that.  Yeah it's been over a year now [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And did they any pictures of your eyes or were you actually  seeing a doctor, do you remember?
PATIENT: Uh the last time they gave me an eye exam a bunch of malarky about the one eye.  See what happened with my eyes, I had cataracts.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: One doctor worked on my one eye, he was an Oriental doctor, the guy was great.  I mean he got done and I almost had 20/20 vision and I was supposed to get the same thing in the other eye but with the other eye I had another doctor, but the day of surgery he wasn't in so some other guy took over and as far as I’m concerned, he fucked my eyeball up.  Cause I got nothing but trouble with it and one bullshit excuse after another.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Then finding another doctor, reset the lens a little bit and uh that helped a little bit with the little floaters I was seeing but the eye it's still not right, the lens and I guess they tell me there's nothing they can do so.  But I can still see without glasses but my right eye the vision is just a bad if not worse than when it started.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And between you and me I'd like to hit that other guy.  Put my finger in his eye.
DOCTOR: I think you're due for a colonoscopy too.  I’m just looking. [REDACTED].  You had one in 2005.
PATIENT: Was it really that long ago?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Five years ago and you had small polyps it said.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It was one of those polyps that can grow to cancer but it was small so.
PATIENT: Well I know they removed it.
DOCTOR: Yeah they removed it but uh, I think we need to get it done again.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's always a lot of fun.
DOCTOR: You like that don't you?
PATIENT: Oh yeah I love it.  It’s like the story of the lawyer and the man another guy was sitting there in a steam bath [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] finally one day I said hey what kind of work you do.  [REDACTED] I'm a lawyer and [REDACTED] no kidding.  Wow that's interesting, let me tell you what kind of lawyer are you? And he goes, I’m a civil lawyer. [REDACTED]  So what kind of job you doing?  The guy goes I'm a magician and the other guy goes what, a magician.  He says I’ve loved magic since I was a kid. I love magic. Do a magic trick [REDACTED] well it's kind of hard because I don’t have my cape, my cane, my top hat [REDACTED] and the lawyer being a lawyer says oh yeah, he says if you were a real magician you would do me a trick. He says, Okay, I got one. Stand up and now bend over, so the lawyer bend over and he says now can you feel my thumb in your ass and the lawyer goes yeah and he goes da da.
DOCTOR: I've never heard that one.  [REDACTED].  If you don't mind stepping up here.  I like your shoes are they new?
PATIENT: You know I buy these at a wholesale place called Havana; I got them out of the VFW Magazine.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: These were $29 bucks.
DOCTOR: They look pretty good.
PATIENT: Yeah and they've got pants.  They've got clothes half of what I was paying for all the time.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I mean like these pants.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know knock arounds.  They were cheap, I bought a couple pair of these and then the shoes, they're all like Dr. Scholls, they’re all good shoes.
DOCTOR: Comfortable?
PATIENT: Yeah comfortable.  In fact I get more comfort out of these than I do when I go to the shoe store.  It seems like everything in the shoe store is tight, stiff.
DOCTOR: Yeah it doesn't. It takes a while to get used to it.
PATIENT: Like a Chinese lawyer.
DOCTOR: Say [REDACTED].  Take a deep breath.  Let it out, again.  Again and again.  Have you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You know what else I was going to tell you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It seems like I'm having a lot of trouble with my legs.  Like if I sit a while.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And when I get up and try to walk.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No just achy, real painful like you know.  But I know when I was in the military I got hit in the back and uh it's nothing that really bothered me a whole helluva lot but up until, I'd say the last couple of years, one or two years, once I got a job [REDACTED] why it's like I get up and just getting up it feels like I'm really straining though.
DOCTOR: Where does it hurt?  You don't feel hip?
PATIENT: No in the thighs.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: On this one side it hurts [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right.  And you don't have any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: No.  It feels like a [REDACTED] and I do exercises and stuff.  Once I start moving around it’s fine.
DOCTOR: Are you still swimming?
PATIENT: I haven't been because of the kidney thing.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I don’t want to go in the pool. [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Any blood in your stool or black stools?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Can I have you take your shoes and socks off so I can check your feet?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You keep good care of your feet?
PATIENT: Yeah I uh, you know I scrub them good.  My wife bought me special skin lotion for diabetics.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know for the feet.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So I use that.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna do this test where it's going to feel kind of funny.  You tell me when you feel it okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You say yes.
PATIENT: Yeah I felt it it's like a bump.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You feel all these.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Tell me whenever you feel it.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah uh I can feel it a little bit yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  You haven't lost any of your, tend to get nerve problems from your diabetes.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Any circulation problems in your feet that uh.
PATIENT: I do notice though on occasions uh my feet get a little sweaty.
DOCTOR: Sweaty?
PATIENT: Real sweaty.
DOCTOR: Let me give you a hand there.
PATIENT: Either sweaty or real cold.
DOCTOR: You can put your shoes and socks back on.  I want to talk about your case with the other doctor.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um otherwise did they tell you what kind of stones they were?
PATIENT: No.  Well I don't think they uh, I don't know.  I have no idea what kind of stones they were.
DOCTOR: It was a uric acid stone.
PATIENT: What does that mean?
DOCTOR: Um well it uh, it's uric acid stones.  Uric acid, you've never had gout before?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  It happens when you have uh a high level of uric acid in your blood.  When you have high uric acid sometimes you can get gout, sometimes you can get stones.  You haven't had gout before.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: But it's pretty painful.
PATIENT: I know what gout is.
DOCTOR: In your big toe and stuff uh so we can think about putting you on a pill that decreases that level and this is not the first time you've had stones is it?
PATIENT: Well actually yeah this is the first time I ever got treated for them.
DOCTOR: Treated for them but you've had them for a long time.
PATIENT: I was just amazed, uh surmising I guess you know.  I really don't know.  I always get pain in the back for years but I always thought you know I worked construction and I worked pretty hard my whole life
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I just figured I twisted a muscle or something you know and I never thought about stones at all.
DOCTOR: Stones are.
PATIENT: Cause my wife had them and the pain she was going through was something else and I didn't have that pain.  Like I said a couple of times I'd say the last few I've had blood in my urine.  I mean not real heavy.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know I noticed the color had changed.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But that kind of cleared up so I never paid attention to it.  As far as the real serious pain I didn't have up until January and then I didn't know what it was.
DOCTOR: Well I'll be back okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'll be fine, I won’t hurt myself nor nuthin.
(DOCTOR OUT:  45:05  DOCTOR IN:  60:51)
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: I just have one more thing.
DOCTOR: What's that?
PATIENT: I'm having a lot of trouble with getting an erection.  It's been a while now it's really starting to bother me see.  I went from a stud horse to a eunuch you know.
DOCTOR: You want to try something?
PATIENT: I got to do something because it's like it's the only thing it's good for is pissing you know and I went from like uh, like I said I was very very active and now it's just that it's like I'm just a a log sitting there you know and I don't know what to use or what to take because of all the meds I take I don't want to to take something that will counteract something else.
DOCTOR: Right.  Um no it should be okay, you should be fine no problem with what we're gonna do.
PATIENT: Okay.  I’ll surprise the old lady – and myself.
