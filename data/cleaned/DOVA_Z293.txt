DOCTOR: All right.  Anything going on or is this just a follow up with you.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: All right.
PATIENT: About 6 weeks ago I was in the Emergency Room for my shoulders.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I saw about that.
PATIENT: My diaphragm [REDACTED] arthritis in my spine.  It is not down the middle of my back.  Starts here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My muscles in my shoulder here.
DOCTOR: Um Hum.
PATIENT: And up the back of my neck.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  The Emergency Room doctor prescribed 2 pills.  One of whom he gave me 9 of them, to take 3 for 3 days.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And the other one I think it was "restatome" or something like that.  It's for more severe pain, but don't take too much of it because you damage your liver or something.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: "Hydroxatone or Drexatrome" or something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I been taking it, but it says take 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours or as needed.
DOCTOR: Was it here?
PATIENT: No it was at Good Samaritan Hospital.
DOCTOR: Oh, okay.
PATIENT: I still got some of those severe pain pills left, but you know. I don't take them every 4 hours.
DOCTOR: I wouldn’t take them.
PATIENT: I don't want to screw up my liver.
DOCTOR: You got to be careful.
PATIENT: But I gotta get something for this.  I don't know, it's been bothering me quite a bit.
DOCTOR: What’s going on with this?
PATIENT: Well, it is the muscles.
DOCTOR: Where?
PATIENT: Um hum.
DOCTOR: All across the back?
PATIENT: On both sides and sometimes it goes right down to this [REDACTED] with some muscles in the arm hurt.  Then it hurts when you are bending your head, ya know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Around the shoulder blade here.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] rotator cuff, [REDACTED] because I am worried about your rotator cuff.
PATIENT: He told me, well he says "it is because you have arthritis there or it could be a pinched nerve".
DOCTOR: A couple of things it could be.  I want to make sure we found the right thing.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We will do a couple of tests today, maneuvers.  Arm to right right shoulder.
PATIENT: I don't know what a MRI would show.  If it is a pinched nerve?   But, I don't think it is a pinched nerve.  It would be more severe if it was a pinched nerve, wouldn't it?  I mean…
DOCTOR: Depends, there would be some pain.
PATIENT: Oh it is painful, boy.  I get a catch in here sometimes.
DOCTOR: It is in your neck?  Or in your shoulders?
PATIENT: Well it starts in the neck here, but it goes down both sides in here, but mostly on the right side.  It goes down the right side, across this shoulder, down to this rotary cuff and all that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]
PATIENT: And those pills though, those pills helped – the ones for the severe pain, that pill helped, but again after that wears off it comes back, so I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I didn't think it would flare up this soon but it did.  I think he diagnosed that in 2005, when I went to Wooddale, no, it was Lombard and  I seen this chiropractor and I went up there and he took all kinds of x-rays of my spine.  Then I went through some therapy which helped a little bit.
DOCTOR: Did you have home nursing?
PATIENT: Um?
DOCTOR: Did we set up home nursing for you?
PATIENT: Ah, yeah, those we talked about that before.
DOCTOR: What was that for?
PATIENT: Well she just comes in and checks my vitals.  It is a [REDACTED].  Her name is NAME.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She comes in and she checks my blood pressure, weighs me, checks my blood sugar.
DOCTOR: You need it?
PATIENT: Well, if she is not there I do it myself.  But it is good to have her show up and she'll check me out.  She makes her notes.  Medicare pays for it.
DOCTOR: You don't pay for it?
PATIENT: No, I don't pay for it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: As long as you aren't paying for it I don't care, as long as you don't pay for it.
PATIENT: (laughs).  Yeah.  I think the Medicare takes care of that.  I have been doing it since, well, how long has it been, since I was living in the [REDACTED] Apartments out there.  It is good that she comes in and does that, you know she comes in and checks me over.
DOCTOR: How often does she come?
PATIENT: Ah, I think it is twice a month I think.  I don't know.
DOCTOR: Oh. Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] huh?
DOCTOR: Just twice a month.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I signed a transfer paper to have Omega come back.  I don't know how Sunrise got my name, but I would rather have NAME come out.  She is pretty good.
DOCTOR: Omega?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Nursing.
PATIENT: Is this what you got from?
DOCTOR: Um hum.
PATIENT: Yeah, I almost forgot about that, because they told me that I had to see you and you would wonder why?  You know? And all that.  It is nothing major, it just comes and it is just something. You know? Because I do have a medical staff in the building over there, but, they never see me.  I don't know.
DOCTOR: Oh, they don't?
PATIENT: No, and they got all my records.  So I don't know what.  I need to get this arthritis checked out.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It is probably arthritis.
PATIENT: And the weather don't help either.
DOCTOR: It’s probably, I don’t know [REDACTED] am not going to be able, based on clinical findings, [REDACTED] support [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well, I don't know what is included.  All she does is check my vitals, takes my pulse, checks my blood pressure and I give her my records on all my blood tests, that sort of thing. The sugar checking device.  I weigh myself.  Those sort of things.
DOCTOR: Will say say this, needs, pulse [REDACTED] you need.
PATIENT: The basic stuff.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED],
PATIENT: I don’t need it.  I can get around.  So they don’t [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I got those orthopedic shoes from here I think it was, the diabetic shoes that I wear to support the sole inside.  I wore these today.  That should come back to Omega. Right?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It says you are homebound.  Are you homebound?
PATIENT: No I'm not homebound at all.
DOCTOR: I'm not going to be able to fill this out then.
PATIENT
Well no, I, you know.  I can go and come.  I got my own wheels and that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well this…
PATIENT: You mean I won't be able to get her to come out.
DOCTOR: I don't know. You might want to talk with her.
PATIENT: Um hum.
DOCTOR: You might want to talk to her about that, because basically what this says.  It says you are supposed to be homebound.
PATIENT: No. No. That's doesn't pertain to me.
DOCTOR: Oh, huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  She comes out there for me.  [REDACTED].  I have my own apartment up here in Wheaton [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You might just want to talk with her again first.
PATIENT: Gina?
DOCTOR: Yeah, to make sure of this.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Because I was just reading through this form and that is what it requires that I can’t fill it out.  But if that is not what it requires then I do have problems filling it out for you.
PATIENT: Well no.  She didn't require it before.  She'd come out.  I had my own wheels, my own apartment.
DOCTOR: Just ask her about it?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is all cut and dry.  You know.
DOCTOR: I could give her a call if you need.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah, just trying to figure it out.
PATIENT: I've got the phone number in my [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I had the Omega number. It's [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Do you want to talk to the nurse yourself?  Or?
DOCTOR: Yeah, don’t do it now. Give me the number though if you have it.
PATIENT: It is [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: All your labs look good.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We will check one lab today.  PHONE NUMBER.  Okay I will give her a call now.  You have 1 lab today, your BMP.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  One of those crappy [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You’ve always had that cervical thing.
PATIENT: Cervical what?
DOCTOR: Degenerative. We noted that last time.  Let's do an exam [REDACTED] okay?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I am going in for a biopsy on my prostate exam.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I am going to go to Dermatology and have this thing taken off over here.  The mole.  I need to get that out.

PATIENT: I've got pain in it right now.  Yeah.
DOCTOR: Where at?
PATIENT: In the muscles themselves, across here.
DOCTOR: All right.  The neck like that.
PATIENT: That hurts.
DOCTOR: Where?  Is it a [REDACTED] pain or what does it feel like?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I feel a little pain, just a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I don't know what's up.  Pain in that area.  Gotta be a muscles.  It is all basically at the muscles itself.

PATIENT: It is all basically in the muscles itself.
DOCTOR: Here, at the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.  Okay.  So that’s sore. Yeah, in the muscles.
DOCTOR: So, we can do a couple of things for you. For the muscles. Would you want any physical therapy.
PATIENT: What do you mean?  [REDACTED] Physical therapy ain't going to take the pain away.
DOCTOR: I imagine it will.  It will strengthen the muscles around and it'll take the pain way.  We got to get you on a good medicine.  Hum.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I want to get something that is not damaging to my vital organs or intermix with the medications I am taking now. You know?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You know I am taking all the pills for [REDACTED], heart pills, cortisone.
DOCTOR: Are you taking anything for depression?
PATIENT: I am taking [REDACTED]. I am taking a half a pill.

DOCTOR: Why not?
PATIENT: He prescribed, you pronounce it different. [REDACTED] What do you call that?  Etodolac. Is that on that? You got my medical?
DOCTOR: Yeah, I just looked at it.
PATIENT: What you call that, Zylopram? and I think it was tramadol I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You were on that a long time do you think?
PATIENT: Not for a long time, no. He said if you take it, you get addicted to it. I don't know, so he just put me on Zylopram.  You know.
DOCTOR: That was more for [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don't know what he called it, [REDACTED]. I call it Zylopram, I don't know what you guys use, what terminology for it.  That is the one I am taking now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh, try to take.  Just like you were telling me about, you know.
DOCTOR: Why don’t we try tramadol?
PATIENT: Is that a nerve, ah?
DOCTOR: No it's a pain medication.
PATIENT: Oh, okay.  So that wouldn't intermix with the other medication I am taking?
DOCTOR: No, not really, [REDACTED] has a little interaction but I don't think it would be a problem.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: There is always a [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well the strong pill.  I have a few of those pills left.  I usually take 2 and it works.  You know?  But, I don't want to take too much of it.  It says it can cause drowsiness, dizziness and a couple of other things on there.  Yeah, [REDACTED] is what I call it.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will send you some.
PATIENT: I didn’t know it was for pain.
DOCTOR: That must be the one. Trazodone is a different one.
PATIENT: Oh, Okay.  It could be a different.  Like I said you know more about the medications than I do.
PATIENT/DOCTOR Z293
(Laugh.)
PATIENT: I blather too much.  Take 2 aspirin and call me in the morning.
DOCTOR: (Laughs.)
PATIENT: [REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: (Laughs.)  They did that didn't they?  Ah Ha Ha.  I think that is all what I am going to give to you right now. [REDACTED] labs.
PATIENT: Vaguely, I did want to follow up. [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It is mainly right in the muscles themselves.  It is not a bone. You can get arthritis in the bones too, basically this is all muscle.
DOCTOR: Do you want see physical therapy too?  Because they help with that.
PATIENT: Well, I can do that.
DOCTOR: If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but they will strengthen [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah. Yeah.  Come back at a later date maybe.  I don't know.
DOCTOR: On your basis.  You schedule when you want.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I will put it in.  They will call you and you can tell them when you can do it.
PATIENT: I do have a weight at the house that I lift.  I work on my upper body stuff and I get 10 pounds in each hand and I do like this.  I go up here and I go like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: On both sides.  That is how I gained a little muscles in my forearm.
DOCTOR: It does the same thing for your neck.
PATIENT: Oh it does.
DOCTOR: They will give you exercises to do.
PATIENT: I usually do 10 reps with, you, know. But I just want to get this pain to calm down, but I can't even move in bed for crying out loud, sometimes.  I've been laying on a heating pad.  Okay.  That has helped a little bit.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay, then I do it across, you know, back here.
DOCTOR: Do you want a cream to put on it too?
PATIENT: You know I've been using Ben-Gay but it doesn't seem to help that much.
DOCTOR: There is a stronger one called Capzasin, it is a pepper cream.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Just don't put on your eyes and wash your hands.
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no, no.  That is taboo.
DOCTOR: You don’t want it?
PATIENT: What's that.
DOCTOR: Capzasin?
PATIENT: Is this better than Bengay?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well, let me try that.  For how long?
DOCTOR: Three times a day with meals.
PATIENT: Three times a day if I need it.
DOCTOR: Or with meals, like do it all the time.
PATIENT: Yeah, it says.  It gives me hell.  It may be on the right side sometimes.  Sometimes a little over there, but hum.  I can't recall.  Like I said I think the damn cold weather.   The weather must have been, now that it is warming up a little bit it isn't too bad.  But I still have pain there today.  I hadn't taken anything.  You know.
DOCTOR: Hum hum.
PATIENT: I may go back and take 2 of those pills.  I think that the way they got it prescribed on the bottle, this guy at Good Sam's, he says take 1 or 2 pills every 4 hours.  That might be too much for the kidneys, but I can take every 4 hours take 2 of them.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: I don't want to mess up this.
DOCTOR: I'd be careful.
PATIENT: But it does work though, but you gotta be careful with it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you got to be very careful and tramadol [REDACTED] mess with your kidneys really.
PATIENT: All it says is "as needed".
DOCTOR: Yeah.  That is kind of how it works.
PATIENT: I think it is something like 3 mg, 3.5 mg.  It’s supposed to  be strong though.
DOCTOR: Not sure which one it is, though.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay.
DOCTOR: All set. I am going to have you come back in 6 weeks.
PATIENT: I had that on my list here.
DOCTOR: Let me take a look?
PATIENT: Alright, I've got [REDACTED].  You know they don't have it on here.  I think when they took me off of it they didn't put it back on there.  This pill was prescribed by DOCTOR  He is a ….   Hum.  I am surprised that that.  Hum.  Have this renewed okay?
DOCTOR: Do you check your sugars at all?
PATIENT: Yeah, I'll check it out this morning.  This morning it was 180.
DOCTOR: How about later on in the day.
PATIENT: Well…
DOCTOR: How often do you check it?
PATIENT: Well I check it 3 times a day, once before breakfast, once before lunch.
DOCTOR: What are they usually in the morning, breakfast or lunch?  What are they usually?
PATIENT: Usually I will check it before I go to bed.
DOCTOR: Well, what are the numbers?
PATIENT: The last week it was high.  This week it has been 140, 180, 121.  I had some lows, 58, you know.
DOCTOR: What was the last? What’s your normal breakfast one? What’s your normal lunch one?
PATIENT: The lunch one, kinda high 200s.  A couple of times it was 140, 121 in the morning, 140, 150.
DOCTOR: What about dinner?
PATIENT: Yeah, dinner usually runs about 163, sometimes 167.
DOCTOR: How many lows in the past month?
PATIENT: About 4 or 5, I had 47, 58, 53.
DOCTOR: What were you doing when those happened?
PATIENT: Well, well, I take sugar.  I got some stuff, like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Were you not eating a lot?
PATIENT: No, not bad.  May be I took too much insulin that brought it down too much.  Okay.
DOCTOR: More than you normally give yourself.
PATIENT: I am taking 22, DOCTOR has my slow-acting to 22 and then I am taking 8, 8 and 8.  Sometimes if I eat a lot then I will increase that 8 to may be 9 or 10, you know.  I am trying to get a pattern.  I am trying to get a set pattern of those.
DOCTOR: When did you quit smoking?
PATIENT: I quit smoking when I come back from Nam in November of 1965.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And here just in the last 4 years I stopped cigars and pipes.  I got one of those things you use.  What did they call that?  A water…
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] Yeah. You know I don't have the withdrawal symptoms but I just put it on anyway, either that I will get popsicle sticks to stick in my mouth and ches on.
DOCTOR: Well, your blood sugars are still way too high.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I see that you use glargine.  Your morning glucose was how much you said?
PATIENT: Eggs.
DOCTOR: No, what is the number in the morning when you wake up?  What is your blood sugar when you wake up?
PATIENT: Oh I take it about 7:30.
DOCTOR: No, what are your sugar numbers in the morning?
PATIENT: Oh in the morning.  Sometimes they run high, but here recently they have been running, well this morning was 180, last week I was about 140, 141, 121 like that.
DOCTOR: Are you getting any lows in the morning?
PATIENT: Not too awful much.  No.  Usually sometimes it will kick to 200 if I don't take.  I don't take the slow-acting at nighttime, just once in the morning.
DOCTOR: You take it in the morning.
PATIENT: I take in the morning with my NovoLog.
DOCTOR: You take them together?
PATIENT: Yeah.  [REDACTED] if I go over there.  If I hadn't been going here, what she says is just kind of a fatty tissue - so he just wrenched out and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: What I've been doing.  I went to a couple of classes to get versed on that.  If I take 10 or 11 it might be a little too much.  But it depends on what I eat.  If I eat too much then I have to compensate for that.  I gotta cut down on the apple juice or orange juice.  I got orange juice in the icebox and I always take it if the blood sugar goes down to say 72 or 62 or 50, then I got a take it and drink a couple of glasses of orange juice to bring it up, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I try to keep right on top of this, because I don't want to get.  Since I’ve been a diabetic, I think I had bottomed out twice and I don't want to do that.  That is just because that is a weird feeling.
DOCTOR: Feels weird?
PATIENT: I break out in a cold sweat, when they bring me too I feel as cold as hell.  Then I sweat.  It happened to me at Sport Mart over there [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: Yeah, I went over take [REDACTED] I am a collector.  I went over to pick up one of those Louisville Slugger Bats, you know?  It was a blonde bat but it didn't have that indentation in the end of them.  I took a black bat that they did have left, the new model.  So, just have it as a keepsake.
DOCTOR: They are pretty cool.
PATIENT: Yeah, and I bottomed out I think.  My sugar went down and told the girls.  They finally got me a couple of Hershey bars, but that didn't work.  I passed out in the store.
DOCTOR: Oh, really?
PATIENT: Yeah and when I come too I was inside the Paramedics Truck.  My daughter come over.  I had gotten one of those clean shirts and this one was soaked.  I was freezing a bit.  Holy shit!
DOCTOR: You really need to monitor your diet.
PATIENT: Hum.
DOCTOR: You need to monitor your diet very closely.
PATIENT: I have been talking to the nutritionist downstairs too.  You know, my diet is basically - in the morning time I’m talking about breakfast.  It is either pancakes or waffles, scrambled eggs, hash browns.  What did I say - he says to stay away from the hash browns if you can,  Coffee, raisin toast or wheat toast.  That is breakfast basically.  Then I have one grapefruit which is cut in half.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Now lunch time varies.  It could be hot dogs, it could be pasta, it could be rice and what they call pureed chicken with rice and all that.  Meatloaf, Hungarian meatloaf and then at nighttime they will have that Hungarian goulash, BLT, stuffed peppers and let's see, what else, meat things.  I said meatloaf, potatoes and gravy.  They usually serve broccoli sometimes, that is pretty good, carrots.  That is basically the nutrition over there.  Breakfast was like I said either pancakes or waffles, scrambled eggs and sausage, sausage patty.  I have either raisin toast or wheat toast.  That is basically breakfast.
DOCTOR: That is not too bad.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I’m trying to cut back. My doctor advised "Well don't eat it all, you know just eat, you know in moderation".  I think I said I am trying to do that and get a set pattern when I take my sugar, at the same time trying not to rise. It’s not as bad as it has been.  I am trying to get that down.
DOCTOR: You really need to take everything at the same time.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: You eat at the same time and check everything out, because your sugars are still way too high.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I know.  One thing today when I come in here I was fasting so it should have been 180 or less.  What was it today when they draw blood I wonder?
DOCTOR: Did they draw your blood earlier today?
PATIENT: Yeah, they took blood.  Now when I come here it was 180 and I didn't eat anything.
DOCTOR: Well they didn’t do it?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: They didn't do that as fasting.
PATIENT: Oh they didn't.  Oh shoot.  Well I think it was probably high now because I just ate.
DOCTOR: That's fine.
PATIENT: Because I can check.  I got the thing in my pocket.  I know what the results it will be [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well don't worry about it.  It does not matter what it is right now.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I am due to take my insulin.  I have got my insulin with me.  I need to do the day shot.  Well wait a minute I did do that this morning.  I took, at breakfast time when I had breakfast out in the chairs, I took 22 units slow and I took 7 units of fast.  I didn't want it to go down to quick when I come to see you, but they I ate a bowl of chili at lunch time.  So I don't know the variation between that.
DOCTOR: You got to make sure you are taking it all at the same time.
PATIENT: Oh absolutely.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right now it is going to be high I think.
DOCTOR: We will work on that.  We will have you come back a little sooner.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: We will try and see.  I want you to have a log of your sugars.
PATIENT: I got a log. I keep a log.
DOCTOR: Can you bring it next time?
PATIENT: I can bring it [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: When you come back in two months? Bring it next time.
PATIENT: It will be another 6 weeks before I see you.  You come in and you work 5 days and then you are off for [REDACTED]. They give me your your schedule.  What do you work?  He work 5 days a week, and then you are gone for 5 weeks.

PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there is no vacation [REDACTED].
