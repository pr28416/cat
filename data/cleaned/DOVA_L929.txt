PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Uh PATIENT how are you doing?
PATIENT: I think I'm fine doctor.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your computer.
PATIENT: I don't have nothing, no complaints.  No pain or nothing so, I guess everything seems to be pretty good.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Ya'll give me them pills and I'm here.
DOCTOR: Uh you were in the hospital a little while ago for some diarrhea?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Is that gone?
PATIENT: It's been gone the day after they discharged me and I only took that pill for one time and then everything was gone and I just don't take it the next morning cause so far, so good.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And I see I have those pills left.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Save them for another day or something.  I hope I never have to do it.  I wonder what happened.  Maybe it something I ate I guess, I don't know.
DOCTOR: Probably yeah.
PATIENT: But the other than that I hadn't had any problem.  I love to eat.
DOCTOR: That's good.  Alright.  I see your blood pressure's good.
PATIENT: And I go play bridge and I go to the race track.
DOCTOR: That's great.
PATIENT: Oh yeah I enjoy.  Haven't had anything to do with sex but I have to get on and do that too.
DOCTOR: The last time you were here, did you get your blood drawn?
PATIENT: Yes I did.  I think so yes I did.  Because you wanted to know something and you concerned something wrong you would call me or something I don't know.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Yes sir because I left from here and went right on over.
DOCTOR: Okay cause we wanted to check your blood sugar to check you know how your diabetes was doing.
PATIENT: Well it's doing good doc.  Sometime I think it's really low.
DOCTOR: Your blood sugar?
PATIENT: Yeah it's been low.
DOCTOR: Do you check it at home?
PATIENT: Yes I do.  I take that thing and I checked it the other day and I ate a lot of fruit and apple pie and it was 116, but it's been in the 60s, 70s and the 80s.
DOCTOR: Okay do you ever feel dizzy or like you're gonna pass out?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean when I seem to wake up in the morning, don't feel too good, then it's very low.  So I drink a lot of orange juice.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mostly know when it's really low but it has got down to the mid 60s.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Is that too low or what?
DOCTOR: Yeah 60 is low but if you feel like dizzy um then you, you know that's a problem.  So are you taking any medications for your diabetes?  No huh.
PATIENT: No they don't give me anything.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I just kind of watch it and check it, like you said before, every other day check it you know to see what's happening.
DOCTOR: Yeah and so you know basically if you have these feelings of like dizziness or kind of feel like weak, you know, just take some candies or drink some juice.
PATIENT: Yeah when I can tell, a little piece of candy [REDACTED] in case I need it.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: No I haven't had any [REDACTED] with those so far.
DOCTOR: Okay or uh.
PATIENT: And as a matter of fact, I didn't bring it in today okay.
DOCTOR: Or you could drink some juice.
PATIENT: Well I drank a little orange juice.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: In the morning.  I didn't drink any this morning so I feel fine this morning.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So it must be that maybe cause I ate a big slice of apple pie last night.  No when I feel pretty bad I'm gonna jump on that orange juice right quick and then take it.  Thatâ€™s early in the morning, you know when I take that sugar tabs.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: No they don't give me no pills, not in a long time for that.
DOCTOR: Yeah I don't think you need it.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: That would probably drop your sugar even lower.
PATIENT: No I don't want to do that.  Ya'll been taking good care of me so I have no problems whatsoever. And I'm gonna do what you tell me to do and that's it.  How did the blood thing come out?
DOCTOR: From the last time you were here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: Cause you didn't call me.
DOCTOR: Yeah it was normal.
PATIENT: Okay well then I'm, that was it because I was waiting to hear from you and then I didn't get no call.  That's about it.  About the only thing I do, I sleep a lot.  I rest and I can be looking at the TV and go to sleep.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How about at nighttime?  Do you sleep at nighttime?
PATIENT: Oh yeah I sleep and then I have to go to the bathroom.  Let's see when I go, if I go at 9 o'clock, it's about 1 o'clock and then by the next morning.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh that's not too bad.  I mean you know.
PATIENT: It may be because I drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because I know when I'm traveling on the streets I don't drink much water but at night when I get home I start drinking a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that'll do it.
PATIENT: Does that do it?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Try not to drink or eat anything like two hours before you go to sleep, before you lay down.
