DOCTOR: PATIENT?  How ya doing?
PATIENT: Pretty well.
DOCTOR: Good to see you again, come on back.  I [REDACTED].  So what's new?
PATIENT: I'm glad you asked.  I got a list.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I uh, I had this Grover's disease for a couple of years now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It, it's not gone.  It's kind of in check uh still bugging me a little bit and, and the next thing.  When I take my cup of coffee in the morning and I lift it like this, my hand goes like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's new for you?
PATIENT: Well it's new in the last five or six months.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um and my, it doesn't have, you know any particular tremor but this is the one where I'm using several small muscles and when I get the coffee cup up to my, so I wanted to mention that to you.
DOCTOR: Is it just the one hand?
PATIENT: Well, I mean it's all I notice.  I, I don't feel any particular unease in my body.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Or I'm not shaky going down stairs or anything like that.
DOCTOR: It's your right hand?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Are you right-handed?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You've never seen it in your left hand when you're doing stuff?
PATIENT: I tried on my left hand and uh, I, to a point it's similar but the place I, I first noticed it was my right hand.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So anyhow, I thought this might be a decent time to mention it.  It get, it's gotten a little bit more prominent in the last eh, you know as time goes along.
DOCTOR: And it doesn't happen all the time, just happens occasionally?
PATIENT: Just occasional.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I don't have any trouble putting keys in you know in a car or anything like that but.  Something else I noticed, I'm getting reflux.
DOCTOR: Okay what do you mean by reflux?
PATIENT: I get, if I, especially if I have something to eat after 7 o'clock at night.  I'll go to bed and I'm laying there and all of a sudden I get swallowing because the reflux, the gorge, the acid kind of a taste comes up through my trachea.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you get like a strange taste in your mouth you're saying.
PATIENT: It's not a strange taste when it comes up, you just don't start swallowing junk.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And so sometimes I get up and uh maybe just sit for awhile, go brush my teeth but that's happening, it probably happened eight or ten times in the last month.
DOCTOR: You've had this before too?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: In your chart did somebody mention that you've had this reflux before?  What would have done that, that notion?  You've never had an endoscopy that I've seen in our system.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Ever have one a Loyola or anywhere else? No?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had medication for that though?
PATIENT: No, but you know my squeeze (NAME), takes, she has reflux and so she's had the endoscopy and the different things and so she's been treated for it and so that's what makes me think I just had too much to eat probably.  That's a big factor.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know I need a piece of pumpkin pie and ice cream at 8:30 at night like another hole in the head right?
DOCTOR: Uh, have you noticed certain foods that make it worse?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do you know a food that typically makes it worse.
PATIENT: Yeah, I always eat Haagen Daz ice cream.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] It's possible but it's just not in the literature to say Haagen Das ice cream.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Tobacco, caffeine.
PATIENT: I don't drink.  I mean I don't drink that I can remember.  I don't smoke, never.
DOCTOR: Alcohol?  Caffeine?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: You told me you're drinking tea right?  Coffee right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh minty stuff, like menthol?
PATIENT: Huh no.
DOCTOR: Um tomato and citrus stuff?
PATIENT: Maybe, I know I like pasta.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh you know spaghetti and meatballs.
DOCTOR: Some people get it worse, if they eat spaghetti sauce they can tell right away, because they get bad reflux symptoms.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And like you mentioned, it's classic.  If you eat right before you go to sleep, now that's the problem.  Then you lay flat and the stuff that you eat you're pushing it back into the esophagus.
PATIENT: Exactly.  And so it's almost like the hiccups, I mean here it comes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: At 6 miles an hour.
DOCTOR: And it's not and it's not uh, you know it's not anything like, if you have it for a long time you get problems with changing of the cells that line your esophagus.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The cells that line the esophagus are a certain type of cell type and they're different than the ones in your stomach.  The ones in your stomach are used to the acidic environment.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And if the esophagus gets exposed to this acid over and over, they start to change to resemble more of the ones in the stomach they got to cope with it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But as those cells change rapidly, there's a chance of developing cancer.  Something called Barrett's esophagus.  If we see a change in the cell type of your esophagus that tells us that you now are getting close to reflux but now you're having change in the cells.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That puts you at risk for esophageal cancer.  So it's nothing that we need to worry about now.  I'm just saying, you know it's something to keep an eye on because it's something you want to treat.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now your squeeze, well what kind of medicines did she take for that.
PATIENT: You know I really don't.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Except that I know that it's been a problem for her for a few years now.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: And uh it hasn't, it's not cancerous.
DOCTOR: No, no I mean there's nothing to suspect that at this point and you need to know um that's nothing I'm worried about.  I'm just telling you, so this is why you know doctors can be concerned about this stuff.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They need to think about it.
PATIENT: Well it suddenly occurred to me if it happens after 8:30 in the evening again, maybe it's like, [REDACTED] I do this.
DOCTOR: Yeah don't do that yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: Okay I got that part.  Uh so those are the things I wanted to ask.  By the way I've got a friend who had shingles.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's horrible.
DOCTOR: Terrible.
PATIENT: Yes.  He said, he said have you ever had a shot for shingles, I said no why.  He said you can have like an antibody shot, a shot for shingles prior to getting shingles.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: After which once you get it you're toast, you're in for the ride.  So here a guy that had an itch that I really don't feel comfortable with and uh and it held on for a while if I was just wondering if the shingle shots were available?
DOCTOR: Yeah we can get you one.  Uh they're probably going to be, so I don’t think I could give it to you today, be able to schedule this for you, you have to come back and get it.
PATIENT: That's fine.
DOCTOR: But it's no problem.
PATIENT: But if it's available I'd like it.
DOCTOR: Did you get a flu shot this year?
PATIENT: No, hell no.
DOCTOR: You didn't get one?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I got one when I was in the service in the 50s.
DOCTOR: You got to get it every year.
PATIENT: It gave me the flu every time Jesus.
DOCTOR: You can't get the flu from the shot.  Let me get this phone call.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR ON PHONE CALL: 45:56 until 47:13)
DOCTOR: Okay, sorry about that.
PATIENT: No that's okay.  Uh the only thing else I got is, I got a friend, a lady, that socially I know, has had Grover's disease.  I said oh yeah I had that, [REDACTED].  So she had some and she's a little obese but in any case she got light treatments for it and it was very effective.  Now I'm just sitting here, I'll get up sometimes in the middle of the night I'll have sensations on parts of my body and in Grover's disease it's laying there.  You know it's not dormant it's just preceded.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm not comfortable.  I know its there.  I mean you know I just have the awareness, it's a cold shed that's all.  I just wondered if I got if I need to go to Dermatology and see if that might be an avenue that might.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Put this in.
DOCTOR: I'm fine with that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I don't know enough about it to say whether it's a good idea.  I know I just looked at all the medications down for this and there are quite a few and I wouldn't be the one doing the treatment so I would say you call the Dermatology Clinic and say look I want to talk about this option.
PATIENT: Cool, I'll do that.  Other than that I guess uh.  What medicines do you show me getting?
DOCTOR: Uh terazosin, uh for prostate.  Finasteride, both those right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You take uh simvastatin.
PATIENT: I take uh, simvastatin I don't take.
DOCTOR: You stopped taking it?
PATIENT: Just a minute I said the simvastatin I am taking.
DOCTOR: But it's not on the list.
PATIENT: Not on the list.
DOCTOR: It just expired that's all, renew it.
PATIENT: Okay.  I would like uh, I would like some medicine like a two months supply of medicines.  It's pretty stable, so a two or three month's supply of medicine of those three sent to me if you will.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Then [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I have some other creams and other stuff you use as well.
PATIENT: Yeah.  You know what, to be truthful with ya.
DOCTOR: Which ones of these don't you use?
PATIENT: Uh the cream that I don't use.
DOCTOR: Capsaicin, you use that one?
PATIENT: Capsaicin.  I don't use that.
DOCTOR: Okay we'll get rid of that one.
PATIENT: Okay and uh that's it.
DOCTOR: This uh, this steroid cream you still use?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah I've got some still in stock and once in a while if it bothers me.
DOCTOR: Which one do you use?
PATIENT: Uh, you know.
DOCTOR: The [REDACTED] and another one, do you use both of them?
PATIENT: Uh, I should.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] this one [REDACTED].  Do you use those?
PATIENT: Very, very sparingly.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Usually on a hot spot, I've got maybe seven or eight spots on my body that are, they're more bothersome than others.  I mean I could, you can scratch it and you know you're in trouble.  It's one of those when I itch too good, kind of a deal.
DOCTOR: Yeah, okay.
PATIENT: I've got a half dozen of those spots on my body.
DOCTOR: What about these other ones, hydroxyzine, do you take the Zyrtec, do you still take any of those?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll get rid of those and then that shampoo you still use?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You don't use that either?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: I thought that stuff worked pretty good for you.
PATIENT: Ah it did but you know, I've got about six bottles of it.  Heck it was really designed to put on my body when I was in, pretty extreme.
DOCTOR: Flares right?
PATIENT: Yeah and uh and it was just supposed to be all over my body.  Well I never, I got a little better and I stopped using the darn stuff.   So it was like a salve really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I can stop it.
PATIENT: You can dump, yeah you can dump that.  That's my shopping list ho, ho, ho.
DOCTOR: That’ my Christmas present, from me to you.
PATIENT: (Laughs) Whatever but uh, but uh the tremor I have it's this funny, odd motion where I'm using shoulder and different muscles you know and it comes up here and it's in the morning, maybe I'm not ready to give it a whirl or what.  It kind of catches me in the morning first thing.
DOCTOR: Uh alright lets.
PATIENT: So the reflux, I’m good, we're gonna watch it if it's okay with you.
DOCTOR: No what's the.
PATIENT: And I'm not gonna eat after 8:30.
DOCTOR: That's, that's one way to do it.  Let's uh, there's a couple of things we could do about this really.  Um, I’m just looking at your last labs, it’s been a while.  Okay, we need to recheck your blood on your next visit; we're fine on this visit okay.  And your blood pressure was okay um.  You ever take your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Um no.  I've never had high blood pressure.  As a matter of fact most surprising it's down in the 59 or 60s; it's usually be 70 and 110 or 112.
DOCTOR: Oh. Okay.  Alright come on here we'll take a listen.  I'll let you know what we’re going to do with this stuff.  Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright let's see your hands, stick them out in front of you all the way. You want to see a trick? This is what I do.  Keep your arm straight.  Ah see this doesn't count, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Stop.  Alto! I speak Spanish.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it’s not that.
PATIENT: Now.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I’ll be truthful with you, if I didn't drink coffee I'd never even be talking about this.
DOCTOR: Is it only when you drink coffee that you get this?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, it's just that I'm sensitive.  You know hot coffee, you're pretty careful about things that you lift.
DOCTOR: What I’m saying is it is after you drink coffee do you get the tremor?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's the first shot.
DOCTOR: Okay let's do this uh, finger of your right hand, touch your nose, touch my finger, nose again, touch my finger, nose.  Okay other hand, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: What that is it's called an essential tremor.  It kind of runs in families but a lot of times it doesn't.  It's nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's not like a Parkinson's type thing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's just stuff some people get.  It's like a nervous twitch.  More common in old age.  Unless it really bothers you and inhibits what you're doing, there's not a good treatment for, for tremors like that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I would uh, you know I would just try to live with it the best you can.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If it gets worse or you notice things happening when you're not moving, when you're just kind of resting and that's when we need to think about other things; so for now I would have you just.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'll just qualify it and if it gets worse.
DOCTOR: It's called essential tremor.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You can look it up if you want but that's just, it's a benign thing.  It's nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Breathe normal for now.  No chest pain, no trouble breathing?  Deep breath in and out. (Examining patient) Another deep breath.  Open your mouth, ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Okay lay back for me and lift up your shirt as well. Can you unbutton or?  Okay up here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: No change in appetite?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: No weight loss or anything like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay climb off.  Alright.  Um so this seems like reflux you're right.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Yeah now that bothered me cause she's had it for the last two or three years off and on.  You know fighting it and doing whatever, so she, we're very aware of it and the ramifications of course.
DOCTOR: Um, so the foods I mentioned that causes trouble with those foods or late at night um and then we'll try this medication.  We'll try it for a couple of weeks, maybe a month, two months to see how it does.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] for long period of time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll use it [REDACTED] and that's fine and at then at some point we'll try to stop it and see if the symptoms have improved even off of it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay does that make sense?  It's called omeprazole when there's just lot of acid to your stomach, so if you have some reflux it doesn't cause any problems.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It doesn't irritate the lining of the esophagus okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] frequently she sleeps with two pillows so that her body is tilted a little up, it seems to help.
DOCTOR: Yeah it can help.  I don't [REDACTED] for you.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Uh, give me a second and I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Oh you know what else, colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: When was your last colonoscopy, it says what was it five years ago or so?
PATIENT: Me?  Colonoscopy?  You know what I just had, I just had a operation for prostate and they went in through my.
DOCTOR: Yeah but that's not a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: Well, that's such a fun thing.
DOCTOR: You were probably don’t need another one um we generally seem to stop screening about 75 to 80 uh but you had polyps on your last one right?  From what I remember.
PATIENT: Mmm.
DOCTOR: Uh so that's something that we need to look into.  If you have polyps you're supposed to follow them up every five years or so.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I.
DOCTOR: Hey I mean you're pretty healthy.
PATIENT: I don't want to be a hero or anything you know just.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If it's time, we'll get the colonoscopy.
DOCTOR: Where'd you have it done last?
PATIENT: Out in Aurora at uh.
DOCTOR: In the VA Aurora?
PATIENT: Not in the VA.  I was using the Medicare.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh.  I have a doctor out there at uh.
DOCTOR: Do you know what hospital you had it done at?
PATIENT: No.  It’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] Copley?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: One farther out west uh.
DOCTOR: I'm not sure then.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know what, I mean I'd like to see the records if you could get them.
PATIENT: I can.
DOCTOR: Yeah cause that would [REDACTED] if you have to have one done here um.  You know for most people who are 76, I honestly say it's no problem, for you I think it's worthwhile doing.
PATIENT: I'm probably going to be around a while.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Everything else equal.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'll get em.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh do you want me then to uh.
DOCTOR: You can just bring em with you next time if you want.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You won't have to pay, bring em the next time you come in.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um I'll be right back.
(DOCTOR OUT:  59:41  DOCTOR IN:  64:04)
DOCTOR: Alright.  Um, let's try this medication called omeprazole for your stomach.
PATIENT: Okay, alright.
DOCTOR: Take it once a day.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter if you take it morning or night.  Take it in the morning with these other medications.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now we'll try it for about three, two or three months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll see how you do.  If your symptoms are not completely better we may have to do the scope to look for something else that could be causing this.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Fair enough?
PATIENT: Sounds good.
DOCTOR: I’ll see you in about three months, try to get those records for your colonoscopy.
PATIENT: In three months I'm gonna be in Florida.
DOCTOR: When you coming back?
PATIENT: Probably.
DOCTOR: Ever?  Are you coming back?
PATIENT: Well, yeah I come back when it gets warm up here.
DOCTOR: When, when is that?
PATIENT: Uh, I usually I'm down there for the month of March, big part of February.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I usually get back April.
DOCTOR: So that's ah like six months or five months from now.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well obviously, I'm not going down for another month or two so you know, if these things haven't been alleviated.
DOCTOR: Yeah we usually want to use the medicine.
PATIENT: I'll be like on like a cold sweat.
DOCTOR: You want to use the medicine about eight weeks or so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But yeah I mean if you're, if you have no improvement after you know a couple weeks of this medication.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let me know.
PATIENT: Okay I will.
DOCTOR: And uh you know what if the pain gets worse also on this medication you know let me know or you know the reflux symptoms get worse.
PATIENT: It is distressing to say the least.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean it will wake you up like a shot.
DOCTOR: Yeah but I think we know what it is so that's pretty reassuring.
PATIENT: Okay, okay, that's good.
DOCTOR: And this usually treats it pretty well.  So, April will be about five months, we'll say five months we'll have you come back.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We'll see how that's doing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Like but yeah in the meantime, if it's getting worse or anything, just let me know so we can try to get you set up for this.  We'll get some baseline um blood draws today.
PATIENT: Okay alright. I already had a blood draw.
DOCTOR: Which order did they fill?
PATIENT: I got here at 2:30 I think.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  For your PSA?
PATIENT: Uh, they never, I just went down and got it because they said come in early, get some blood drawn, but I didn't have, they didn't die it or anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah, [REDACTED] from the Radiation oncologist.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: What we need um, I want to check your blood levels with this and uh your Lipitor for next time you come in, your cholesterol panel.  We just need a fasting lab.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'll get my blood taken again.
DOCTOR: So yeah, I'll let you get your blood taken again today.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then again before you come in next time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Fasting, so you don't have to do it now, you can do it in April but you need to do it fasting.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Even this time, so I should fast for this time?
DOCTOR: No so this time we could do it right now before you leave.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Next time you come see me, in five months.
PATIENT: Well you say we'll have a baseline and we'll be able to.
DOCTOR: Uh come with the colonoscopy record, come with this lipid panel.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And the cholesterol panel and uh I will put a the desk – the vaccine is called the Zoster vac.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know what, when they call back in to do the Zoster vac, you could do the blood draw then if you want.
PATIENT: Yep, okay.
DOCTOR: Or you can do it today.
PATIENT: Okay, when would that?
DOCTOR: I think it should be in the next week.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh, you know.  As long as I'm here I might as well have the blood drawn.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is fine.
PATIENT: I'll just stop on the way out so.  Okay, so I'll be sure I have the, why can't I think of that hospital?
DOCTOR: I don't know, the only one I know out there is the Copley.  They'll mail this stuff out to you, the medication uh.  You should be getting it in the mail and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm kinda figuring that will pretty much tie me over till you know.  I don't want to be in Florida and running out, that's the whole thinking.  Once you change your address to send it to you that's your new address and I got to change it back.
DOCTOR: Well the thing is yeah I don't want it, you know this medicine is for a limited time use so if you're using it five months down the road that's, we like to see is to use it for two or three months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And see how it does and then stop it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's the idea.  We don't want you on this for a long time.
PATIENT: Alright.  That will work.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  We'll get you set up.  Get your blood drawn here.  So they'll call you when they're ready after that you will see the nurse who will get you set up for the vaccine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] on your way out just drop off the form and they'll do the packet.
PATIENT: But today I'm gonna [REDACTED] what?
DOCTOR: Today you get the blood drawn and then the nurse will see you to schedule all that stuff.  Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Just have a seat and they'll call you.
PATIENT: Okay, thanks a lot.
