DOCTOR: Hey how you guys doing?
SECOND PERSON N270
Doing good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It’s about time we saw each other.
SECOND PERSON N270
We got the [REDACTED] taken.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON N270
Yeah.
DOCTOR: All the way back here.
PATIENT: This is about medication.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And most of all.
DOCTOR: This is it, wherever you want to sit, no you're fine.
PATIENT: Most of all it's about blood pressure medication.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And we did not have the world's best nurse.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She got 151 over something or other.  I've been taking it at home and I've never gotten that high.
SECOND PERSON N270
She was asking him inappropriate questions.
DOCTOR: What was she asking?  Do you mind me asking what she was asking you?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: What was she asking you?
PATIENT: She was asking do I ever bathe, did I take a bath this morning.  Can I change my own clothes?  Can I eat by myself?  I've never been asked that and then she kept saying to somebody outside can I go, can I go and then she left.  So I told her.
DOCTOR: So, really focused on [REDACTED]
PATIENT: I told her this is about blood pressure medication and she, you know it was a losing situation.  Just to be sure you might want to take my blood pressure yourself.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna tell you my rule for blood pressure with my patients.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If you're going to the trouble of writing all these down every day, I trust the numbers you're taking.  I'll check it again but even if it still comes back high today after that kind of experience my blood pressure would be high right now.
PATIENT: Okay.  She was the same one, by the way.  A couple of months ago we were here for four hours.  We were here till they closed.  She locked the door.
SECOND PERSON N270
Locked us in and left.
PATIENT: And then left so then the doctor had to open the door.
SECOND PERSON N270
Try to get the papers.
PATIENT: So she would know who she was treating.
SECOND PERSON N270
It's just so different.
PATIENT: I'm sure they've got rules here that make it hard to get rid of nurses but.
DOCTOR: Oh here, they can get rid of...
SECOND PERSON N270
[REDACTED] finger in her ear and her nose.
PATIENT: Yeah that was weird too.
SECOND PERSON N270
Never saw anything like that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON N270
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
DOCTOR: We're kind of getting off.
SECOND PERSON N270
Here is something like.
DOCTOR: If it keeps you from getting fired but.
PATIENT: Okay here's, I had been taking this for a long time.
DOCTOR: I'm going to pull up your chart while your [REDACTED] down okay.
PATIENT: I was taking this for a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes you were, I remember.
PATIENT: Yeah.  My systolic is high so then DOCTOR, you know DOCTOR, that’s you, prescribed this.
DOCTOR: Yeah, the additional one.
PATIENT: So.  I been out of this for about a month.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Just taking this and I'm getting good readings.
SECOND PERSON N270
So maybe you don't need the other one.
DOCTOR: I think you know the answer okay.
PATIENT: Don't take this anymore.
DOCTOR: We'll cancel that and take that one out.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you're doing well on this one, this has a half-life of one day so if you've been taking this every day and it lasts all day and it's keeping your blood pressure fine, hey, less is better is more.  Let’s get rid of the one you don't need.
PATIENT: Yeah I used to cut them in half but then you told me.
DOCTOR: Just take the full thing.
PATIENT: Just to take the whole thing.  Okay and so that's.
DOCTOR: So you've got a good one that works well for you huh.
PATIENT: Uh here's.
DOCTOR: And you're breathing one.
PATIENT: Now here's the problem.
DOCTOR: Is DOCTOR still giving that one?
PATIENT: Oh gosh yes.
DOCTOR: (Laughter)
PATIENT: Uh, did you do this, DOCTOR, that’s right, okay.  You prescribed this because you said it was a better one to take than this.
DOCTOR: No this has a different one.  This has got both in here, albuterol plus ipratropium.
PATIENT: Anyway I can't renew this.  They tell me they didn't have it anymore.
DOCTOR: Let me look at this for you.
PATIENT: When they told her.  He wanted me to take this one.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Let me read my last notes to jog my memory real quick.  How's your shingles doing?
SECOND PERSON N270
Gone.
PATIENT: I had them 30 days.
DOCTOR: But it's gone.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Good, good, good.
SECOND PERSON N270
Well speaking of shingles.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Vaccine.
SECOND PERSON N270
Did they ever get the vaccine?
DOCTOR: Of course not.  Why you know would the VA do anything efficiently.
SECOND PERSON N270
So that's really a long time.  They said they would have it by January.
DOCTOR: Let me check and see.  I know when I inquired earlier this month they didn't have it, you know what I bet they have.  I just, I usually don't hold my breath for such things.
SECOND PERSON N270
Well obviously you would have been dead a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see.  You're over 60.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I do not expect you to live less than a year.  They actually ask me these questions.
PATIENT: I took a bath today.
DOCTOR: You did take a bath.
SECOND PERSON N270
(Laughs)
DOCTOR: You don't have any blood cancers.  You're not taking steroids.
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had a reaction to gelatin, a medication called neomycin, anything like that?
PATIENT: No I don't have a reaction.
SECOND PERSON N270
I don't think he got sick from any medicines that we know of.
DOCTOR: Um, when you were younger, you never had tuberculosis, did you?
SECOND PERSON N270
No.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And you've never had the vaccine before?
PATIENT: Which vaccine?
DOCTOR: The shingles.
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON N270
Yeah.  He gets just the shingle disease.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON N270
I thought that the vaccine was new.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's been out for like four or five years, maybe a little bit longer.
SECOND PERSON N270
Is it that long?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON N270
I thought it was just this year.  This is the first year I heard of it.
DOCTOR: It's becoming to the point where now we know enough about it to say go get it.
SECOND PERSON N270
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But before they had it we were just like do we give it, do we not give it, we're not sure, it’s only been out a couple of months [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON N270
Okay.  Maybe that's why I didn't know about it.  I had it in 97 and nobody offered me a vaccine.
DOCTOR: Still not?
SECOND PERSON N270
No.
DOCTOR: You're still indicated to get it even if you had the shingles.
SECOND PERSON N270
I had it in 97 but I [REDACTED] had the shingles.
DOCTOR: How about now, did you get the vaccine?
SECOND PERSON N270
Not yet.  I'm gonna ask my doctor about it and I can see.
DOCTOR: Let me see uh, uh oh it looks like they may have it at the Pharmacy, so let me put it in, we'll see what happens.
SECOND PERSON N270
[REDACTED].  He could get one dose today when we're done.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Oh okay, here's what happened.  When you saw the pulmonary specialist back in November, okay because this time you didn't see DOCTOR, you saw this guy DOCTOR.
SECOND PERSON N270
Right.
DOCTOR: And another, I think he’s Turkish or Syrian, a guy named DOCTOR.
SECOND PERSON N270
Yeah.
PATIENT: We've had Indian doctors, Syrian doctors and a guy we thought was from Turkey.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've seen a multitude of.
PATIENT: It's always like being [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah so with the last guy DOCTOR he speaks very fast and so this is the way.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  He's a German guy.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And he speaks really fast.  He actually says because he's a lung specialist, I think this one was working well for you.
PATIENT: It was.
DOCTOR: Yeah but now.
PATIENT: And they won't renew it.
DOCTOR: Well he just basically said in his notes, he would prefer you to be on this one and not this one.  He thinks this was gonna be better for your cough.
SECOND PERSON N270
And it hasn't been.
PATIENT: And you thought this one was.
DOCTOR: Which one did you thought worked better for you?
SECOND PERSON N270
We thought the other one.
DOCTOR: This one helps you more?
SECOND PERSON N270
Cause now, since he's been on this one, he's never stopped coughing.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm not supposed to go against them because they're the boss but we'll make the change.  I'll write in my note you symptomatically noted that this is better for you and I think between the two, at this point, it's what makes you feel better you know.
SECOND PERSON N270
Yeah.  That's right.
DOCTOR: They're not, neither of these are gonna change what's going on inside your lungs, the chronic bronchiectasis, the mass you see, they'll always be there, we just want you to feel better.
PATIENT: Okay when you say you're gonna put this in for me.
DOCTOR: If you think that they cancelled the order for this.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's why you can't get any more of it.
SECOND PERSON N270
He can put it back in.
DOCTOR: I can put it back in.
PATIENT: Just put it back in.
DOCTOR: But I have to get rid of this one and I'll write in my note that we thought this was more beneficial for you and that's why we're switching it back okay.  And before I do that, let me listen to your lungs really good.  Can you take off your shirt?
SECOND PERSON N270
Here.
PATIENT: This is more powerful, I think.
SECOND PERSON N270
So give me your [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: They have the same power.
PATIENT: Oh they do.
DOCTOR: This has the exact same power but this has an additional medication in it called ipratropium which works on a different part of your lungs.
PATIENT: So why don't we keep that then.
DOCTOR: We can keep that if you want this one.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's purely up to you.
PATIENT: Yeah this one, this one.
DOCTOR: It's the same amount of albuterol in both of them.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you want this one.
PATIENT: Decide on this one.
DOCTOR: Okay we'll keep it as the lung doctor suggests.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON N270
So [REDACTED].
PATIENT: He's treating our daughter.
DOCTOR: Oh is he, over at UIC.
SECOND PERSON N270
Uh-huh.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'm going to check your lungs; can you take a deep breath?  Out.  Good, in and out, in and out.  One more.  [REDACTED].  Any pain here?  Let me see you skin, any new lesions on your skin?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You notice anything new?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] shingles .
DOCTOR: They got you a nice tie, high and tight didn't they.
PATIENT: That's my son, he's cheap.
DOCTOR: And this hasn't changed at all has it, the redness in the cheeks?
PATIENT: I don't know, the shingles is gone, 30 days.
DOCTOR: When was the last time.
SECOND PERSON N270
That was so gradual; I didn't notice what it was.
DOCTOR: When was the last time they had to freeze off some of the skin lesions from the Derm Clinic?  Dermatology.  Did they recommend that for you?
SECOND PERSON N270
Oh they did.
DOCTOR: The dermatologists freezing off like lesions.
SECOND PERSON N270
He took off something yes.  One time, the last time, remember?
DOCTOR: Do you check your skin every at least every couple of months, look for new lesions?
PATIENT: No, I should.
SECOND PERSON N270
We do once a year or two.
PATIENT: No we're just counting on Dermatology to do it.
DOCTOR: But you are still seeing them though right?
SECOND PERSON N270
Once a year.
DOCTOR: Once a year.  It's better if you do it yourself in between; the year long time between when you see them, only because a lot can happen in a year.
SECOND PERSON N270
Do you think this is something?
DOCTOR: Oh that's probably just from [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah well.
PATIENT: I'll let her do it because I'm a bad spotter.
DOCTOR: Alright, you be the spotter okay.
SECOND PERSON N270
Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let me see your legs.
PATIENT: Yeah spotters huh.
DOCTOR: Any swelling?
PATIENT: No.  Now everybody talks about that and.
SECOND PERSON N270
Maybe all the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I think its muscle, honest to God.
SECOND PERSON N270
Or a lot of water.
DOCTOR: It's probably just a touch of water, not a lot.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's [REDACTED] socks [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Everybody talks about that as if I'm gonna die from it.
DOCTOR: No, no, that's not the reason.  Uh you may just have thought it was, but I think.
PATIENT: But as far as lungs go.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I go to the Health Club and work out strenuously and I do snow removal now.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: And I'm not getting shortness of breath, honest to God.  That's the good thing about it.
DOCTOR: Definitely, you'd come tell us if you were.  I mean that's.
PATIENT: If I were I'd tell you and I'd tell DOCTOR.  I'm coughing, I'm bothering her but I'm not getting shortness of breath.
SECOND PERSON N270
The thing is he doesn't usually cough while he's sleeping.
PATIENT: Well see when I get horizontal, I cough.
SECOND PERSON N270
While he’s up, he’s coughing all the time.
DOCTOR: Yeah but when you fall asleep it goes down.
SECOND PERSON N270
It seems to stop.  Cause I'm up and he's still sleeping, his coughing stops.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay I'd like to get this renewed.
DOCTOR: Ear drops, no problem.
PATIENT: I kept getting wax in my ears.
DOCTOR: How are you cleaning your ears?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: You're not using Q-Tips are you?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Are you using any Q-Tips?
PATIENT: No, no, that's a bad thing to do.
DOCTOR: Right, just making sure.
SECOND PERSON N270
He has a brush that he uses to clean out his hearing aids.
DOCTOR: Okay, but when you put the drops in you just let it run out on their own right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So it runs out, good.  Any questions?
PATIENT: No.  I was gonna ask if you could renew this but it looks like we've got enough.  Cause this certainly helps.
SECOND PERSON N270
What is it?
PATIENT: Ultram right,
DOCTOR: Tramadol?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's a pretty good pain medication.  It doesn't have too many side effects.  What kind of pains are you using it for?
PATIENT: I use it after working out, doing anything strenuous and my knee.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that’s right, the knee thing.
PATIENT: It seems to work better than anything else.  I don't overdose it though.  No if it says take two I only take one at a time, just to ...
DOCTOR: So when you do your snow removal, I guess you're gonna have a lot of work to do tomorrow huh.
PATIENT: I use a snow blower.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON N270
He's got the snow blower all ready.
PATIENT: My son paid $350 for it to save my life.  But once in a while I use a shovel.
DOCTOR: How far out do you guys live?
SECOND PERSON N270
We're from Chicago, we live in.
DOCTOR: In Chicago.
SECOND PERSON N270
Towards the north side [REDACTED].  There must have been a terrible accident today on the way [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Bad traffic.
SECOND PERSON N270
But they had a sign up even that there was an accident around Sacramento and it really, really was crawling so I really [REDACTED] I think that by the time that we got there, they had moved away the vehicles.  Has he had blood tests in a while?
DOCTOR: Yeah, he had them just about five months ago.
SECOND PERSON N270
Okay.
DOCTOR: Which [REDACTED] for him.  He's not on any medications that will mess up his labs so usually once a year is enough.  If something changes clinically or he's having some new symptoms then we recheck them but I think the next time you come in we'll get some repeat labs.  So let me make sure all your medications look okay before you leave.  Your inhalers they're all good, set-up for you for a year okay.
PATIENT: Yeah these are good.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure pill is good until November.  You have all the refills you'll need.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh.  You're still on, you don't need the gabapentin anymore right?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: The gabapentin, the one you took for shingles, you're not taking that anymore are you?
SECOND PERSON N270
No.
DOCTOR: Let me get rid of that.  Uh oh it mentions, when was the last time you got a shot in your knee?  Are they still doing that?
PATIENT: It didn’t work.
DOCTOR: Did it help at all?
PATIENT: It stopped working.
DOCTOR: The tramadol has been working okay though?  The Ultram, the pain medication?
PATIENT: That's all that's left.
DOCTOR: It's still helping though?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: It's still helping?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  That's good.
PATIENT: Those shots in my knees and I had a lot of them.
DOCTOR: Just not cutting it.
PATIENT: It stopped.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna refill this one cause this one's out.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you're on 50, one tablet three times a day?
PATIENT: I don't do that.  I just take it one at a time.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And I'll put that in the mail for you or do you want to pick it up today?
SECOND PERSON N270
In the mail.
PATIENT: Just mail them.
SECOND PERSON N270
Could he get the shot today?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna send you to the Pharmacy as soon as I go talk to my boss.  I'll send you to the Pharmacy now to pick up the shot and then hopefully one of the nurses, we'll see if we can find a different one, will give you the shot okay.  Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah they can mail this.
DOCTOR: That and then this one you can pick up today if you'd like.
PATIENT: Okay.  Tylenol in the mail [REDACTED] and the new inhaler keep.
DOCTOR: Um how long does one of those tubes of earwax softener last for?
PATIENT: I can't tell.
DOCTOR: How often do you use it?  Every day?
PATIENT: Every day.
DOCTOR: And then how long have you had that bottle for?
PATIENT: Well I've got a couple other ones that you know [REDACTED] you know I really can't tell when they're out.  I squirt it on my hand to be sure that they’re not out.  I just want to be safe, yeah.  As long as we're doing this.
DOCTOR: Let me talk to my boss real quick okay.
PATIENT: Uh Nasonex is the only other thing that I.
DOCTOR: It's in there, I already checked.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Thank you.
(DOCTOR OUT:  28:58  DOCTOR IN:  38:56)
DOCTOR: I'll have you guys go to the Pharmacy to get your stuff.
SECOND PERSON N270
Okay.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh [REDACTED] get everything [REDACTED] talk about this.  I thought it was less good use of your time if you're here waiting.  I don't think there's anything new I'm gonna tell you.  Get your medications.  Just swing by the door and I'll tell you anything else I want to change.
SECOND PERSON N270
Okay and what do we do with the shot?
DOCTOR: You'll pick it up at the Pharmacy, so it's at the Pharmacy.
SECOND PERSON N270
I know that.
DOCTOR: Bring it back to the Nurse’s Station here and they’ll be the ones to administer it.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Have a nice day.
PATIENT: Oh you're keeping me alive.
DOCTOR: Be good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright.
