DOCTOR: I think we are going to give you an antibiotic and I think it'll help clear it up.  You can, I don't know if we have uh, so basically what we found when you were admitted to the hospital, we do like those nasal swabs. Do you ever remember getting the nasal swabs?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You have a bug that grows in there called methicillin-resistant Staph aureus.  You've heard about Staph infection?

DOCTOR: Follicle that can get stuck, trapped in there like that pus.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And it's a little stronger infection okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you have a bug in your body, not everyone has it, some people have it and if it's in your nose we say it's colonized.  You know, it's just these bacteria grow they don't cause infection for you most of the time.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You may have a little bit of an infection with skin flow which could be this resistant bug called MRSA.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: In which case we can give you an antibiotic which will help clear it.  If you want to get rid of the bug entirely you can do this Decolonization Clinic, I don't think we have it here at the VA though.

DOCTOR: They have one at Loyola but I don't know, I don't know what the options are for veterans.
