DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Ever since I had my knee [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.  [REDACTED] many years ago.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah I saw [REDACTED].  Does the tramadol help?  [REDACTED] help?

PATIENT: [REDACTED].

PATIENT: [REDACTED] one of those questions I had for you.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Woo, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.  [REDACTED] so I tried to make an appointment in audiology.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I tried [REDACTED], I called for an appointment they said I hadn't been here in over two years so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They told me [REDACTED] recommended again.
DOCTOR: I will do that [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What else?
PATIENT: And uh I've been noticing my pulse rate.
DOCTOR: Yes.  Okay.
PATIENT: You [REDACTED] for the last two weeks.
DOCTOR: How [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: So it’s been rising, the one of them.
DOCTOR: Right I see that.  The high, the 100s, what was going on when they're in the 100s.
PATIENT: It doesn't seem to matter.
DOCTOR: Nothing [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Sometimes they're up and sometimes they're down.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um well you've been taking the Digoxin, correct?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Excuse me, you stopped Digoxin [REDACTED] and the atenolol.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: The atenolol.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Are up to 50 millgrams?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: I don't have any pills.
DOCTOR: Okay [REDACTED] your blood pressure is 110/74 okay.  Um, let me think about it because again, I think it’s a good thing that you’re off of the Digoxin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and so the question is do we go up on the atenolol a little more, [REDACTED] 37.5.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And just monitor your blood pressure.  Have you been feeling dizzy at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Um because if you were feeling dizzy then I'd be hesitant to raise the dose but if you're not then let's go up on it slowly.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay so instead of doubling the dose we'll go up [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, alright sounds good.  Um and the appointment for Audiology is for hearing adis?
PATIENT: For the hearing aid.
DOCTOR: For your hearing aids.
PATIENT: I've been missing things you know.  I don’t know if it’s the hearing aids, my own hearing.  I just need an adjustment.
