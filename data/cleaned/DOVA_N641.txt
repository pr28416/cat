DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Right here.  So how you doing?
DOCTOR: Doing well.
PATIENT: Thank you.  Appreciate it.
DOCTOR: I am doing well.  On the right side, here. [REDACTED]
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I am taking over for DOCTOR.  I know you saw in the past.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR:
DOCTOR: here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So what brings you here today?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: What brings you here today?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I need an appointment to see a foot doctor and uh, let me see if I can get some Viagra.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I was scheduled for [REDACTED] but when I didn’t [REDACTED], do I need a, uh, [REDACTED] when you get up to 50 years old?
DOCTOR: Colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy,  [REDACTED] yeah.  [REDACTED].  Yeah, colonoscopy.  I think I had one before.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I think I need another one.
DOCTOR: They said one in 2007.  That was the last time.  Let’s see what they said.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: In 2007 they found that everything looks normal.  You had biopsies taken.  There were diverticula which are like outpouches in the wall of the colon.  Um, everything was normal.  They did take biopsies.  Let me look at the results.  Um, let’s see what else they did.  Upper GI.  So, let’s see what the results showed.  You had a catheterization done after that.
PATIENT: Um hmm.
DOCTOR: And chronic diarrhea.  Is your diarrhea better?
PATIENT: It is about the same.
DOCTOR: About the same, okay.  So the biopsies were actually normal.  Okay.  So you had a return appointment, okay, so then what did they say about the biopsies.  So with this chronic diarrhea, work up was negative.  Stool cards were negative.  So they said followup in GI Clinic.  Are you losing weight?
PATIENT: Ah no.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have gained weight in fact.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Good.  Um, so it looks like all the stool studies were negative.  So what did they decide to do?  Did they say?
PATIENT: No, they didn’t say.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I don’t think we need to repeat colonoscopy.  You had it in 2007.  So you really don’t need one for another couple of years.
PATIENT: Okay, so you have it every seven years or something like that?
DOCTOR: You have it every ten years unless there’s reasons to get it earlier.  If you had, like abnormalities, you know maybe if you have like polyps, if you have abnormal pathology then they would want to see you sooner.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But from the way it looks like they didn’t comment that they want to see you done sooner.  Let me see if in the notes if they actually want to [REDACTED].  Any other questions?
PATIENT: Uh no.  [REDACTED] about colonoscopy?  [REDACTED].  Should I have another one?
DOCTOR: When should you have another one?  Since everything looked okay I think, the biopsies were normal, I think you probably should have one about 2017.
PATIENT: 17?  That long?
DOCTOR: Um hm.
PATIENT: Okay.  Alright.  Other than that, my foot hurts, that started back in 2008 or 2007.
DOCTOR: For your foot?
PATIENT: Uh huh.
DOCTOR: What was wrong with the foot?
PATIENT: They said they might have to operate on my right foot, [REDACTED] stairs, and I never came back, where I was living had stairs so I never did return.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let’s see.  You had an appointment back in 2007.  Let’s see.  Oh I see you had the bony, the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: From the joints, right.  Like a little bony [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And they said, did they want to do something about it?
PATIENT: They wanted to before it gets worse, but they told me I couldn’t climb the stairs, no, after the operation.  So I said I can’t do that so I was just wondering.  It starts back hurting worse so that is why I asked you about it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  Yeah then we can definitely send you back to the clinic.  Let me put in another request.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Any other complaints?
PATIENT: Ah, that is about it.  That and the colonoscopy and [REDACTED].  Uh, I spittin’ a little more but I been doing that for years.  I don’t know what caused that.  I been mucous.  But it comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Have you had x-rays done?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Of your feet?
PATIENT: Ah, no.
DOCTOR: No?  Do you think we can get x-rays? Can I see your feet?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] feet. I am sorry about that.

DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  For the foot, we are going to get an x-ray of your foot today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So the podiatrist can actually take a look at it and see if there is something that they need to look into further.
PATIENT: Okay.  Okay. That sounds good.
DOCTOR: And then when was the last time you had blood work done?
PATIENT: Ah, this year.  I don’t [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I will take a look and [REDACTED] the only thing I would be concerned about is because we have you on medications.  Sometimes it affects the kidneys and also sometimes it affects your electrolytes.  So we should check that.
PATIENT: Okay. Okay.  I got, my ibuprofen I got one left.  I got one left of that.
DOCTOR: One?  How long have you been taking that?
PATIENT: Ah I take them, hmm, well I got pain but I don’t take them every day, you know.  Only when I have pain I take it.

DOCTOR: You don’t want to take them too often, too frequently.
PATIENT: Okay.  I don’t. [REDACTED] I know I got more refills left so I just wanted [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay. I can refill it. But let’s check your blood work first.  You don’t want your kidneys to go bad because of ibuprofen or anything.

DOCTOR: Then we will get some blood work just to make sure, we can take a look at your kidneys.  You know when you are on the ibuprofen, and you’re also taking the hydrochlorothiazide, that can affect your kidneys.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Want to make sure that that looks okay.  The last time,your kidney function, I will tell you what that looked like.  Let’s see your kidney function looks okay.  The creatinine was 1.2.  That is what I am looking at.  The kidney function.  It looks like everything else looked okay.  Your sodium level is a little bit low but I think the hydrochlorothiazide can actually cause that [REDACTED].  Um, and your blood count looked okay.

DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I want, I mean, I [REDACTED] mucous lately for a while now.  I wonder why?  I mean, I thought it was a cold but I can’t have a cold for that long period of time, so what would cause a person to keep on spitting all the time? You know?
DOCTOR: Spitting?
