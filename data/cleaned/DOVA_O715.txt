DOCTOR: PATIENT.
PATIENT: Yo.
DOCTOR: How's it going today?
PATIENT: Hi.  Good afternoon, hi.  So that's who I am.
DOCTOR: Alright I'm DOCTOR.
PATIENT: DOCTOR.  Business card, please?
DOCTOR: I don't think I have one on me here.
PATIENT: Okay I mean how can I get in contact if I like you again for the next time?
DOCTOR: Um let's see what I can find.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: I think they messed up on the medications last time so we need to double check it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].  [REDACTED].  It looks like the last time when you came in DOCTOR saw you because, I was out [REDACTED] in general if you come back to the Blue Clinic on Tuesday afternoons it'll be me from now on okay.
PATIENT: Yeah but if don't come back on Tuesday I can request you right?
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: I couldn't remember 90 days who you are.
DOCTOR: I mean yeah exactly.  It would be nice I wish I had, I’ve given out my last one, I’ll have to get refills [REDACTED].
PATIENT: There's nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with that at all isn't it?
DOCTOR: But uh, no so the last clinic, because we’re all residents from UIC here, my clinic is just Tuesday afternoons but if Tuesday afternoons work for you and that's when you can come in.
PATIENT: That’s if I like you, then I can say “DOCTOR on Tuesday.”
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: Okay uh you know I'd like to have an appointment on Tuesday.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because he’s a good guy, we're getting along okay.  We're starting a doctor and patient relationship, other than seeing somebody different every time you come in.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: It's kind of like ugh.  It's like going to a shoe store and you know the shoes that you like and you know that they fit good but then you go to another shoe store and they don't have them, so what do I do, oh you go back to the original one.  Just uh alright.
DOCTOR: Alright so how have you been feeling?
PATIENT: Feeling pretty good uh.  Been a little bit more active so because of the heat and that I've been kind of keeping it low key, doing uh bicycle riding, doing some walking, doing the flea markets, doing the garage sales okay and keeping myself active.  You know I'm unemployed right now and uh basically I think uh keeping myself in motion.  Coming here today though got me a little, my blood pressure's a little bit high because of the questions they asked me.  I had to go to the people down the hallway here and they asked me questions that I didn't expect them to ask, no they asked but then I came here and they asked the same questions again but uh and the thing is, basically if you have a will, who they would contact and all that and you know to me that doesn't matter.  I only have to have one person once I leave here.
DOCTOR: Correct.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'm just wondering whether [REDACTED] okay but otherwise everything else [REDACTED] for some reason here, it's a very important factor.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because they don't know what to do with me after I'm gone.
DOCTOR: Well it's not that, it's not just that.  I mean there's more reasons that we ask.  I think one of the big things is we want to know if something were to happen what you would want and not at the end but before that.
PATIENT: Yeah I know.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: I see what the technicality is.
DOCTOR: It's nothing, I mean some patients want everything done.  They want, no matter what, they would rather be alive on a ventilator than not um and so it's not a decision you have to make right this second. It's nothing that's urgent um. You're a very healthy 61-year-old that just.
PATIENT: 62.
DOCTOR: What’s that?
PATIENT: 62 next month.
DOCTOR: Next month yeah so a little of the high blood pressure that's been controlled.  A little bit of diabetes that you've been doing good.  There's no obvious problems that the diabetes has caused for you.  That's been pretty well controlled.  Uh so there's nothing that, we're not saying this because we're looking here and we're going oh man we better address this soon because.
PATIENT: Asked twice in one day, I'm kind of like you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But then once again I'm gonna consider what they had to say to me today.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: Now I might have to have another decision or make another decision next time I come in.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: But then once again I just wasn't prepared for all that.
DOCTOR: Right and it's just one of those things that we just have to open up that topic at some point.
PATIENT: Yeah so.
DOCTOR: Twice on the same day.
PATIENT: You know I hope not.  I hope we can resolve.
DOCTOR: But uh so yeah it's just something to keep in mind.  It's not anything.  We didn't pick you out of the crowd and.
PATIENT: I know that.  I know, I know, I know.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  But uh but so since March you've been feeling pretty well.
PATIENT: Yeah, no problems.  Every thing’s cooking along.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And basically, hoping to find a job and.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I've been very active on that.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: I've been actually been going out and contacting [REDACTED].  You know what the problem is, is the people who've been very responsive with their thinking and being responsible for who they are and the thing is when you get a reply back no you're not qualified, we, you're specifically gonna keep you in mind, okay you're getting some type of response.  It's the ones that I send out.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Did it get lost in cyberspace?
DOCTOR: Right, you don't know yeah.
PATIENT: I mean.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's like.
PATIENT: Yeah or.
DOCTOR: Either that or did it just, was there just some mix-up and you need to send it again or yeah.
PATIENT: Like this is the reason why too in relationships between doctors and patients should always be on a regular basis.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because then this way here you feel comfortable, you know where you're going, you know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: Uh seeing only once before, like you said and uh okay I know who you are but I've forgotten how you work.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: Cause it's been six months.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: Okay and the thing is that now that I'm beginning to have a little bit deeper understanding about you and I feel pretty comfortable and I'm kind of relaxed now, we can concentrate on who you are okay, alright.  So um the medication that's in question.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Is this one.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I found when I took one of these big ones that I take twice a day right.  Okay I should take two of these too every time I take one, so that's four a day.
DOCTOR: Take two of them by mouth every morning; let's see if that's what it says uh.
PATIENT: But that's what written out but the last time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean let's go back farther in our record and take a look at that and how many there were before.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It should be, it should be 360 for 90 days.
DOCTOR: Correct.
PATIENT: Or 120 for a month.
DOCTOR: No yeah so you've usually been taking um one in the morning and one at night or two in the morning and two at night?
PATIENT: Two in the morning and two at night because I take two every time I take one of these big boys.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that's for the.
DOCTOR: Yeah was your doctor specific on the old notes?
PATIENT: I mean.
DOCTOR: Let's see if that's twice a day, yeah you've had it twice a day.
PATIENT: Yeah, two tablets twice a day, that's four.  So I take two in the morning, two at night when I take the big boy 2000 mg, the horse pills.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] Uh you weren't having any episodes of low blood sugars right?
PATIENT: Uh sometimes if I don't eat right on time.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or you know what I mean, I might go for maybe an hour, hour and a half.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Then it does go down quite a bit.  It goes down to about 70 but then once you get, I mean I never, I'm always, you feel it you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You get busy, you know then you sit there and say wait a minute; we got to do something now, now okay.  So uh just basically yeah but then that's because I'm not paying attention to my daily procedure.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, so that's the only thing I'd be concerned if you're having those low blood sugars that maybe they went down to the lower dose but you know we can get, it should be two pills twice a day like you've always taken.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah okay.
DOCTOR: And there's no reason to change it because like I said everything has been going well.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh so I'll refill that and I'll send you that too out.
PATIENT: And I had my teeth examined and everything since the last time I was here and uh we had another little problem but they looked into it pretty deeply the last time I was here and we found out it's really not a problem.
DOCTOR: What was that?
PATIENT: That was the uh.
DOCTOR: The [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah and the one where I was having problems with post nasal drip from okay and for some reason uh it all got back to the idea of how much coffee I drink.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay and kind of like okay.
DOCTOR: Sometimes they over think things.
PATIENT: Right, right, you know and I'm kind of like okay.  I cut down on coffee, guess what, no more problems.  No more post nasal drip.  So it took a little bit and we had to drink a lot of water and we put the pressure tester and all that other stuff and as far as they were concerned everything looked good and he focused in on the coffee.
DOCTOR: Good.  Well that, an easy fix then.
PATIENT: Yes it was.
DOCTOR: That's always nice.
PATIENT: Well even when it happens, first of all it's embarrassing.  Second of all you smell like that for the rest of the day.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay and the thing is you know you got to find out what's really going on.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: Okay and sure enough, so all I want is the medication, now we have it all set right?
DOCTOR: Yeah um the refill on all of those yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah well you know and the thing is since I'm doing so well, will you write a refill?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, we'll get it refilled now.  Yeah um.
PATIENT: One time and then this way here I'll come back in so I'll leave this six month.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Period where I won't have to come in okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then I will come in and most likely we'll probably take another blood test and the whole deal, you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah that makes sense it's uh.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Go in the Lab.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so let's see what your cholesterol and see when it was done, September so yeah we don't have to check it until next time.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah that'll be fine.  We just have to check it every one to two years but generally we'll check it every year since you're on a cholesterol medicine.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um to make sure it's continuing to work but otherwise.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Everything else looks good.  Your blood pressure, I think you've got it a little bit elevated but that could be stress, that could be something else.
PATIENT: Well, yeah I told you what I, you know cause normally I don't get to answer these questions and uh well, see here, I got [REDACTED] so anyway.  Nice person.  Interesting, it's nice for her to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What can I say though, oh, alright.  So you'd like these all sent to you or do you want to pick them up today.
PATIENT: Uh I think we can have them sent to me and that'd be at the gas station which which is ADDRESS.  Cause I can't send it to my house you know why don't you?  They get picked up.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah, it's what I have to do.  This is where I want it sent to.
DOCTOR: To the temporary one, yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Because if they send it to the house, believe it or not this guy's following the mailman.  Yeah and there's nothing you can do about it as long as you can stay within uh 50 feet, they come [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: It's in my [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's a little scary.
PATIENT: So the thing is I send it to this guy and it's not a problem.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He's my auto mechanic so; he's a pretty decent guy.
DOCTOR: Glyburide uh.
PATIENT: Yeah and uh will it cost me anything for another pill cutter?  Okay, let's try to get another one of those, yeah.  That's amazing, cutting pills in half but I guess that saved a lot of money.
DOCTOR: Yeah and that's what we do here like in my other clinic over at the University of Illinois we rarely do that.  It's always like if you're going from 10 to 20 or from 20 to 10 you don't cut the 20s in half you just give them 10 mg so but here yeah it saves them money.
PATIENT: I can understand it saves almost millions.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I know it's a lot because there are very few medicines that we don't have people split up.  Have a seat up here.
PATIENT: Alright okay.
DOCTOR: I'll have you take deep breaths in and out.  Okay and lay back.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And uh, so no fevers, chills, chest pain, belly pain?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Nothing like that.
PATIENT: Nothing like that at all.
DOCTOR: No swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: No.  Everything else is fine.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Anatomy stuff.
DOCTOR: Good okay.
PATIENT: No the reason why I had the feet cut checked out, I guess they wanted sensitivity cause I was growing a big callus.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And the problem was is that I couldn't feel anything, you understand on that side of the foot and he gave me a pair of inserts to put in and it made a big difference.
DOCTOR: It did?  Good.
PATIENT: Yep.  That callus went away and I got full complete feeling back on that side.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah it's just a matter of you know tidying and tuning.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It’s always a good thing when it’s an easy fix.
PATIENT: Yeah and the thing is [REDACTED] cheap shoes.  I'd say that's another thing, stay away from the coffee, don't buy cheap shoes.  Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No.  I'm on a tight budget, oh yeah you know being unemployed it's kind of hard.  Tell you what I had these made um online okay and I want you to go over there and it's made by [REDACTED] or something like that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And you get 500 for 15, that’s ten dollars to have them made and five bucks to have them shipped and you get them the next day.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: Yep for 500.
DOCTOR: You put on the.
PATIENT: Yeah, all that, keep it.
DOCTOR: Graphics and everything.
PATIENT: This one here I had done at, what's that place where they sell packing paper and all that other stuff, that was $29.95 for 350.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That was a little too high and I like this, these come out good but then once again go on the internet and they can do everything.
DOCTOR: Oh everything.
PATIENT: Yeah what's that, Vista yeah I think it was Vista.  You see them advertised on TV okay and they make 500 cards for ten bucks okay and this is how it comes.
DOCTOR: Yeah alright.  I have some at home, I just have [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh could be.
DOCTOR: I keep forgetting to bring them.
PATIENT: Sounds good, being a doctor.  I mean.
DOCTOR: We'll see, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No I mean being a doctor you know.
DOCTOR: Right yeah.  So let me talk with.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: He's my attending right now and we'll get you out of here in just a bit.
PATIENT: Okay, alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  52:55  DOCTOR IN:  73:43)
DOCTOR: Alright, sorry about that.
PATIENT: Alright no problem, I understand he's probably pretty busy too.  I want you to print your name on here too before you leave.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Are we gonna double check our quantities again?
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll just run it through one more time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And see you back here in six months.
PATIENT: Okay.  Oh you're gonna do that okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Come up again okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Do you like that Vista; yeah I think its Vista Point or Vista Pal.  You'll find it on the internet.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Print your business card for ten bucks.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it's really good you can do everything on the computer.  So we're gonna check the quantities of these again and.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll just make sure.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I gave you one refill on everything so I'm gonna give you a 90 day supply and one refill so.
PATIENT: Yeah, alright, give me six months.
DOCTOR: I'll see you back in six months.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Uh otherwise we'll not need any blood work or anything till then.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now the thing is when I go for a refill I just call it in?
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: Just call it in.
DOCTOR: Uh yeah as far as I know, I don't know.
PATIENT: I don't know the procedure here that I kind of like, they told me they have a new procedure here going.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright, yeah I'm not sure as far as calling it in to get refills I'm not sure.  If you need, like there's no refills available and you need them you can always talk with them and I don't know if you have the clinic number.
PATIENT: Yeah I got the clinic number.  I got that yeah.
DOCTOR: And um they can just let them know my name and they can get a hold of me and I can put in for a refill.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Like if you need them.
PATIENT: See.
DOCTOR: Just say something got stolen and.
PATIENT: Right, right, right.
DOCTOR: In the mail uh we can always just put them in again and send them to the right place.
PATIENT: Now you know [REDACTED].  See once again I didn't know that.  The only thing I had to do is.
DOCTOR: I mean now that.
PATIENT: Drop your name you know.
DOCTOR: Exactly, now that you're in the clinic I mean we've been seeing each other, I mean this is only your second time but you're in my clinic and as long as you want me to be I'm going to be your primary doctor.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we don't have to go through all the rig-a-ma-roll if um just something happens with your meds.
PATIENT: Well that's important.
DOCTOR: Yeah these aren’t medications that I'm concerned that you're abusing or anything like that.
PATIENT: Right, right, right.
DOCTOR: It's something that, whatever if you lose them.
PATIENT: Right well I've got some; I need the diabetic ones for sure.
DOCTOR: Exactly and they can get a hold of me or get a hold of the nurse and they can get a hold of me.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we can get it all taken care of.  Alright.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Everything else looks good though.  We'll see you back here in about six months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And recheck everything.
PATIENT: Excellent.  Very good sir.
DOCTOR: Good to see you.
PATIENT: Excellent.  Well it feels good that we had this little talk and we're getting to know each other even better and now I know a little bit more about the procedure.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: And uh the only thing I have to really make sure is before I leave here is talk to somebody about the refill and make sure I follow the directions.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I don't know who would be good.  I mean you can try to get in touch, I mean you can go talk to the Pharmacy people.  Tell them I know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you know her?
PATIENT: No I don't know her.
DOCTOR: She could help you with it.
PATIENT: Talking with the Pharmacy people right now is like whoa, you know what I'm saying.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's kind of like.
DOCTOR: with another person regarding prescriptions)
