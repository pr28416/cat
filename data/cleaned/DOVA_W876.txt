DOCTOR: How are you?
PATIENT: Good.  I was falling asleep over there.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Uh once a year I'll find something [REDACTED] send you here um pulmonary function tests and the reports were normal.
PATIENT: Yeah Excellent.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.  Uh how you doing overall?
PATIENT: Um I still have that cough.
DOCTOR: Still have that cough huh.
PATIENT: Yeah.  It um hasn't got any better um.  As a matter of fact it's gotten um I think its a little worse um.  I believe, I'm getting heart palpitations and I think it might be from that uh because I think it's something I get not only at the time I cough or right before I cough.  I haven't figured it out before or after I cough it seems like I've been getting little heart palpitations.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I know [REDACTED] probably so.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you had a stress test recently.  You had a TSH that was normal.  Uh.
PATIENT: What do all these numbers mean?
DOCTOR: Cause your stress test is pretty much to see if you're having – what would be causing the palpitations or its just decreased blood flow to your heart, serious heart problems.
PATIENT: We did that last year I think it was, wasn't it?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  You got that last year.
PATIENT: Yeah we did it last year.  I remember that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um we ended up getting a TSH cause we concerned about the thyroid hormone and that your thyroid hormone was elevated [REDACTED] through that that was normal.  Uh we checked your cholesterol once again this also goes along the lines if you don’t have blood flow to your heart, cholesterol is high then it could be what causes palpitations but that was normal.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So um the reason I ordered the pulmonary function tests, one of the most common causes of a chronic cough is asthma and you don't have asthma.  Uh so there are other common cause of chronic cough actually, there are two other causes.  One is reflux.  Reflux can actually cause a cough, it can cause a cough [REDACTED] asthma [REDACTED].  So um do you have reflux after you eat?
PATIENT: You know I didn't know what's going on here um I think um a while back they gave me some pills cause they was thinking it was acid reflux.  That was before the uh any of the tests that you just described uh the cardio test or that pulmonary test, that was before that.  They gave me some medication um which actually caused one of the side effects and I read those things, unlike most patients.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I read them.
DOCTOR: Sure [REDACTED].
PATIENT: One of the side effects was coughing.  So you ask me will it really do any good, I took these pills so I think maybe 30 days.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Three or four weeks.
DOCTOR: Do you know what pill it was?
PATIENT: Should be in my records, I don't remember the name of it.  But um that was supposed, I guess [REDACTED] the cause but they was discussing acid reflux and uh cause I was like, “acid reflux?”
Cuz’ isn’t that something you can feel like in your throat like you're about to throw up or something.
DOCTOR: Uh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: They said no this could be going on in my stomach and I wouldn't feel it.  But one of the side effects was coughing so how are you going to get someone on medication for coughing when one of the side effects is coughing?
DOCTOR: Well I mean.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right, like you said, profiles oftentimes, unless they are like black-box warnings, oftentimes, for example I can say nausea and vomiting, you'll see nausea and vomiting or GI upset for almost every single medication, but it doesn't mean that everyone has it.  Uh they can actually improve your [REDACTED] so there’s multiple random-controlled trials of uh and well-documented uh trials showing that these medicine can help with the cough.
PATIENT: Well when you come back and you say well  did it do any good.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So my answer to that is I don't know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well [REDACTED].
PATIENT: If one of the side effects is coughing.
DOCTOR: If it didn't suppress your coughing, then it didn’t do good.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If it cause coughing – I didn’t know if it suppressed it.
DOCTOR: No, no right.
PATIENT: And then I had a side effect?
DOCTOR: No it's very simple.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Did the medication help, did your coughing stop after you started taking the medication?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay so it didn't help.
PATIENT: Um and I guess I've been noticing I mean when I get up in the morning I'm okay and usually after I eat you know later on in the day is when the cough starts, starting back.  So I'm thinking am I having an allergic reaction to something um.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry what?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Repeat what you just said I'm sorry.
PATIENT: I said in the morning time it seems to be okay.  Then later on in the day is when it starts, after I eat something.  So I start to notice that.  I don't eat a lot of acidic foods.  That's one thing about me I do not eat acidic foods so I'm thinking am I allergic to something cause I try to keep my PH balance in my day.  I take pills for that.
DOCTOR: What are you taking?
PATIENT: Uh well I take a thing that's [REDACTED], that's alka balance.  But you know I don't take them every day.  No I just kind of watch my pH I have a pH strips that I use [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: To see what my pH, because I want to keep it slightly Alkaline [REDACTED]. Well, that’s going to help anyway because it helps acidic [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Well I mean actually you know, those medications can result in uh.  You're talking about altering the pH of your stomach um which.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah you can do that but uh often times we recommend against that and the reason why is because the bacteria, the reason why your [REDACTED] low pH for one reason [REDACTED] protective mechanism uh but that uh [REDACTED] kills the bacteria yeah.
PATIENT: I think that was supposed to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah so uh it keeps the pH at a very low level to slow bacteria up here so if you're [REDACTED] high reflux you know you can aspirate some of the reflux um it won't be filled with bacteria, you know what I'm saying.  Um so I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing that.  Uh what we can of do though, I mean uh how long have you been on it?  Are you still taking the omeprazole?  Are you still taking that?
PATIENT: I think it was a 30 day supply.
DOCTOR: 30.
PATIENT: Yeah two weeks or 30, something like that.  Two to four weeks.
DOCTOR: Three refills [REDACTED] on.  And you say you took it only for 30 days or did you take it for less than that?
PATIENT: I just took whatever was in the bottle.
DOCTOR: What was in the bottle.
PATIENT: I didn't refill it.
DOCTOR: And it didn't help you at all?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay alright.  Uh usually three month trials.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah let me see what DOCTOR thinks about that.  The other thing that it possibly could be is uh people end up having postnasal drip and uh postnasal drips occurs.  What it sounds like to me, it sounded like reflux coughing because you're saying that it occurs after you eat um and that you notice when you wake up in the morning and it occurred after you eat um.  You know the postnasal drip cough is a little bit different because the postnasal drip cough occurs at night when you lay back down, you get it then.  So now, omeprazole like with a reflux cough can happen at night [REDACTED] too.  That's a very common reason for [REDACTED] when you lay down you cough [REDACTED].  But I mean it sounds like it occurs after you eat, that's what you were saying.  So it very well could just be that I mean you need a higher dose of the omeprazole.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.
PATIENT: That one didn't work.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I don't, I mean if I double up on something that doesn't work.
DOCTOR: Well I mean it could just be the fact that you need a higher dose you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.  My body is supposed to take care of itself.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And that's what I don't want to take pills to take care of this stuff so why. I don't suspect the cough.
DOCTOR: Well [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I want to find out what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Well sometimes it's very difficult to find out what's causing it.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And I wouldn't expect and [REDACTED] is suppressing the cough, you're not suppressing the cause what you're doing is you're ending up treating the cause and that is the way you go about finding out how, what the cause is.  If you end up taking the omeprazole and it actually works then that is the cause.  You understand?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I think if I have a problem and I take something that suppresses the cough or makes me feel comfortable with it, what stops, then I'm taking the pill and I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh well if you want to problem to go away.
PATIENT: What's causing me, what's causing acid reflux?
DOCTOR: Very common.
PATIENT: Is it the food that I'm eating or I wouldn't think so because I'm not eating acidic foods so I'm starting to watch what foods I eat.
DOCTOR: Do you drink coffee in the morning?
PATIENT: No I do not.  I do not drink coffee no.
DOCTOR: Well first of all right now we don't even know whether it's reflux or not so I mean, so I mean I think it sounds like reflux to me but if you're not willing to take the omeprazole then we'll see what else, I mean that's not something that we need to do.  The other thing is [REDACTED] it seems like the serious causes are out of it.
PATIENT: See my thing is that the problem keeps coming and the pills take care of it and dilutes the acid in my stomach that means yeah the pill dilutes the acid in my stomach then I stop coughing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But the problem still exists.
DOCTOR: Yeah well sometimes you can't, you can't.
PATIENT: I want to know what the problem is.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So if you're gonna be taking something and we don't know what the problem is.  We don't even know if it's acid reflux.  I take the pills, like they asked me to.  I took their pills.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: It didn't help.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I took them as prescribed, they didn't help.
DOCTOR: Sure yeah.
PATIENT: Uh it didn't help at all.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So to me [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So it didn't help at all then that's surprising.  Uh like I said I would admit that doesn't fit, in the picture. It didn't help at all, that surprises me.
PATIENT: It got worse.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah and then the other thing that we can possibly do is we could once again is trial, but what we'd do is we'd give you a trial of medication and we'll see if it works.  If it works then that's the cause.  That's the way that it works.
PATIENT: If it works, it helps resolve.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: The issue but it doesn't cause.
DOCTOR: It doesn't cure the problem.
PATIENT: It doesn't cure the problem right.
DOCTOR: Well unfortunately we don't have a lot that we can cure problems with.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I want to find out why.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Why I’m haVing [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean because my diet and I changed my diet.
DOCTOR: How's everything else going for you other than the cough?
PATIENT: Heart palpitations I don't know if it's being caused by the cough.
DOCTOR: Yeah we can give you some.
PATIENT: That’s kind of scaring me.
DOCTOR: Well I totally understand.  When you get, we can give you something called a Holter monitor.  Have you ever had one of those?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] thing that monitors the beat of the heart.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So it monitors the beat of the heart but it monitors it for 24 hours and when you're telling me is you have heart palpitations almost every day, when you cough right?  Whenever you cough?
PATIENT: Yeah I think it just recently started in the last week or two.
DOCTOR: Week or two, I have it documented for like the last time you were here that you had heart palpitations.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah and that was back in, let's see it was back in uh let's see.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Back in November.
PATIENT: Yeah, November?
DOCTOR: Yeah and.
PATIENT: Last month?
DOCTOR: Last month.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: And then.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah and I have it again back in August of 2009 and then I have it back in.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I mean.
PATIENT: So it's been doing this.
DOCTOR: Yeah actually you had it back in 2008 that you'd been having heart palpitations.
PATIENT: Yeah it's getting worse then.
DOCTOR: Yeah um okay.
PATIENT: But now I get it almost daily, It wasn’t daily back then.
DOCTOR: Well we can go ahead and give you a Holter monitor.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And uh see how you do.
PATIENT: Does it [REDACTED] something?
DOCTOR: No it just monitors your heart.
PATIENT: For the acid reflux.
DOCTOR: Um I don't think so, not that I know of.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] what are the causes?
DOCTOR: Um anxiety.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: That could cause it.
PATIENT: I could definitely have that.
DOCTOR: I mean.
PATIENT: Stress.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Definitely.
PATIENT: Fatigue.
DOCTOR: That could cause it.
PATIENT: Cause I been trying to get more rest.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I definitely try to get more rest since that started happening [REDACTED].  So I been trying to get more rest.  The last couple of nights I haven’t been having [REDACTED] seems like I get like four hours, five hours waking up [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Pretty stressed out?
PATIENT: Well stuff on my mind.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know [REDACTED] I'm aware of that.  [REDACTED] before.  So that's why I need to bring it down and try to eliminate all the things that causes stress so maybe that.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah that's good.
PATIENT: It helps.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know it does.
PATIENT: Yeah I need to get more of that.  [REDACTED] love.
DOCTOR: Yeah um.  When do the palpitations occurs other than the coughing.  Do they ever occur without the coughing?
PATIENT: I'm thinking it's more the cough and I'm just trying to remember you know um.
DOCTOR: I mean if you.
PATIENT: I don't need to have any more.
DOCTOR: If you cough a lot.  If you end up coughing a lot and your heart, your hearts’ just going faster in response to it.
PATIENT: So that's what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It very well could be that.  But you know we have to make sure that it's not necessarily a serious kind of palpitations.  Like I mean first of all it could be severe serious causes and non-serious causes causing the palpitations okay.  Uh serious causes result in your heart stopping beating so um and non-serious causes are I mean I'm sure that [REDACTED] but at least you have the comfort of having a non-serious causes [REDACTED] you know your heart beats irregularly for a couple of beats and then it comes back to normal.  So we can get, if you get the Holter monitor we can watch it for 24 hours and I mean you can just be walking around you know doing your everyday things and it will be analyzed and uh we'll go from there.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: With that I'm just going to get the heartbeat, I don't know if it monitors the breathing as well.
DOCTOR: No, it'll monitor, but the palpitations, the cause of it is the heart so.  I mean it could be the heart, it could be just your anxiety but we'll at least be able to find out whether it’s the heart or not.
PATIENT: With that, okay.  That's a little more cardiac stuff I guess.
DOCTOR: Yeah that always helps.  Exercise is excellent.
PATIENT: I want to do more cardiac stuff.  Cause I know exercises can do more cardio stuff.
DOCTOR: Where you lift?
PATIENT: Yeah I need to do more cardiac.
DOCTOR: Yeah I was going to say I lift but I don't [REDACTED] run as much as I should.
PATIENT: Yeah I did real good when I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah that is pretty cool.
PATIENT: Then I think I'm fat.  [REDACTED] more fat old age.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] just to see if I cough.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And then if I cough I want to see if it's after I eat.
DOCTOR: Sure, yeah.  Monitor that.
PATIENT: See if that occurs.
DOCTOR: Try that, yeah that's a real good idea.  Uh.
PATIENT: Well I'm [REDACTED] the body [REDACTED] machine.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I'm just gonna have to watch my body.
DOCTOR: Alright let's [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'll take it cause this coughing [REDACTED].  You know we had this back in, you know I had the palpitations but not the cough.  I had to come into the Emergency Room with that.
DOCTOR: Really.  For what?
PATIENT: I had palpitations um nauseousness.  Think it was last year, in 08 I think that was.  They put me on monitoring.  They monitored me for a few hours.  They took an EKG on me and everything.
DOCTOR: Yeah so what we see, an EKG is just a snap shot, it's like what's occurring as body [REDACTED] it's like a picture right.  Now this, the Holter monitor is a video recording.  So it watching, I mean you just go through your activities every day you know and so it kind of sees your every day life and it sees how your heart reacts to it so.  You know like I mean if you're not having palpitations at that minute and they did the EKG then it doesn't mean anything right?
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: This is the smart way.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So whenever it happens it's going to record it.
DOCTOR: Yeah and it usually happens during the day.  Sometimes the Holter monitor during those 24 hours might not have any palpitations at all so you know it [REDACTED] much use.  But if you're having palpitations, you actually have heart palpitations then you know let's, just they can still take a look at it and we'll see what happens.  So when you actually get the Holter monitor, remember whether you had palpitations that day okay.  Okay check your other labs real quick.
PATIENT: Did you see whether I had any more refills for all the pills you gave me?
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I need a refill for um; I think it was a cream from Dermatology.
DOCTOR: Oh, now what was it?  Is it the hydrocortisone, what was it?
PATIENT: I think it was um.
DOCTOR: When was the last time you saw Dermatology?  Do you remember?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Here we go.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: You're on Retin A cream.
PATIENT: Retin A right.
DOCTOR: Yeah no problem.
PATIENT: That'd be good.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Is there anything else you need?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah that kind of concern me more [REDACTED] cough is when the palpitations kick in [REDACTED], four or five times a day you know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How long do they last when it comes on?
PATIENT: It's like an interruption you know I guess.
DOCTOR: And do you get any chest pain or just palpitations?  Any shortness of breath?  I mean you can take a deep breath right, [REDACTED] occasionally?
PATIENT: Well no, I [REDACTED] no more of that.  I need to do more cardiac okay.  Maybe lifting more I mean, I mostly doing push-ups and I can push them up you know.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How many push-ups do you do?
PATIENT: Well I used to run.  I maybe do about; I mean I do about 60.
DOCTOR: Okay so about an hour.
PATIENT: And then I stop.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then the only thing I maybe do 25, so probably like 100 pull-ups, you know five minutes.
DOCTOR: I think you're heart's in good shape though.  Alright I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Alright thanks doctor.
(DOCTOR OUT:  46:33  DOCTOR IN:  53:09)
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Hi sir, I'm DOCTOR nice to see you.
PATIENT: That's right.
DOCTOR: Is this a cough that you have?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It’s the cough, okay.  Now I'm just perusing those notes on what is causing the cough.  So your breathing has been fine, no sign of asthma um [REDACTED] exacerbate [REDACTED] making [REDACTED] right.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like you have a stuffy nose, blowing your nose, or a tickle in the back of your throat?
PATIENT: No postnasal drip or anything like that no.
DOCTOR: Okay you don't have any.  So [REDACTED] sinus x-ray cause you've had some sinusitis in the past.  That's another common cause for um.
PATIENT: I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: An infection that I had when I was in the service.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, [REDACTED] some symptoms from that [REDACTED].  Smoking, you don't smoke.
PATIENT: No I don't.
DOCTOR: And do you get it in the morning when you wake up, when you start eating actually start coughing?
PATIENT: Uh I'm noticing I'm trying to diagnose it, diagnose it myself.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I think it's been more like, when I get up in the morning I'm not coughing.  Usually after I eat not 100% sure but I think it's after I eat.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Then I start, uh a little bit later on I start to cough.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I don't know if it's because I eat.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or it's because it's later on in the day so I was just telling the doc here that I might start fasting to see what’s going on.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So you have coffee, chocolate [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Coffee? Chocolate?
DOCTOR: And uh.
PATIENT: A little chocolate here and there but not recently I haven't been.  My daughter loves chocolate so on occasion I might have a hot chocolate in the wintertime not in the summertime [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
DOCTOR: Any Cokes or anything like that?  Caffeine would be thing we're looking for.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: No sodas throughout the day?
PATIENT: Uh I usually do teas. Some of the teas have caffeine in them, some of them do have caffeine in them but I haven't even been doing that lately.
DOCTOR: Oh um.
PATIENT: You know so.
DOCTOR: And when they were [REDACTED] treating you um you know DOCTOR a diagnosis and giving you the acid reflux pill, um, we could do relation with the eating you could you know get a formal upper GI where they have you swallow the barium and see if there is [REDACTED] acid reflux they do the same thing.  Um and it's causing you to have more severe  reflux cause [REDACTED].  Uh so we could check if there’s are relation after you’re eating and then you’re coughing. So if we could to an upper GI [REDACTED] make an appointment [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so that could be something we could do.  And [REDACTED] why.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] know why.
PATIENT: Yeah do that.  It seems like phlegm gets [REDACTED] in my throat.  Yeah it seems like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then I will be right back.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  So [REDACTED] is normal.
DOCTOR: Uh I believe so [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You could send him to the see the ENT doctor for [REDACTED] for a day or two and um they also could see [REDACTED] uh reflux affecting your vocal cords or something [REDACTED].  Um you know we could do [REDACTED] or we could just order the upper GI and see what it comes back as um.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Yeah so, um so we could do that yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll have [REDACTED] set you up for that test and if you don't want to take meds then we can get you set up for the test.
DOCTOR: Well he's not taking anything.
DOCTOR: Okay yeah we'll see what we see um.
DOCTOR: So we'll set him up for an EGD correct?
DOCTOR: Um, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh you already, oh yeah it's here [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Hopefully [REDACTED].  Another thing we could do is um [REDACTED] okay.  [REDACTED].  Okay.  Um so [REDACTED].  Lots of things can.  Have you been taking over-the-counter medications like Sudafed?
PATIENT: No I hate medicines.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Okay um and um you can [REDACTED] you drink some tea how many a day?
PATIENT: I would say in the last month I probably drank maybe two cups of tea a week.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So it’s not like a daily thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's not a daily thing, but normally I do. That’s when I drank green tea uh health tea [REDACTED] cleansing tea.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay and you know we could send you upstairs and you could do [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I ordered the Holter monitor.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  So I want you to Outpatient here then  pick up the Holter monitor and wear it for 24 hours.
PATIENT: And where is this at?
DOCTOR: I think it's on the third floor in the Damen Building okay.  So go to the [REDACTED] Building.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And you gave me prescription refills right?
DOCTOR: Yeah so.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Uh I'm going to go ahead and order one other test on you called an echocardiogram alright.  What it does it's an ultrasound of your heart you know like they do ultrasound of baby, only this one is of your heart okay.  So uh. Make sure it’s not cardio. [REDACTED]
PATIENT: [REDACTED], one of those um body scans.
DOCTOR: Like a [REDACTED] scan?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I don't think that a body scan could pick up anything?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] picking up a lot of stuff that probably would be harmless
DOCTOR: So you're gonna go to Outpatient to do the x-ray and the Holter okay and then you can stop by X-ray and [REDACTED] okay.
DOCTOR: I'm doing the, I ordered an echo for him [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] Damen
DOCTOR: No, no no its um, we have to [REDACTED] you.
