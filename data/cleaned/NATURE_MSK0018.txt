DOCTOR: Okay, any sick contacts?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No, okay. So now we're just going to move on to um, the physical exam part of this. So can you take a look at both your shoulders and let me know if you see any redness or swelling?
PATIENT: Um, I don't think I see any redness or swelling, but um, my right shoulder and my arm just seems a little bit lower than my left one.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, any um, warmth on, on that shoulder?
PATIENT: Uh, no, not that I can feel.
DOCTOR: Okay, any atrophy, deformities, or skin changes?
PATIENT: Um, deformity, I, I do feel like kind of uh, like my shoulder's dropped and like there's just kind of this uh, little, like divots, where like the shoulder should be.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. And can you palpate that area for me? Just um, the bones in that area, so like right where your arm would connect to your shoulder and then kind of on your shoulder blade. Does that hurt when you press down?
PATIENT: Yeah, it hurts a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some tenderness and pain in the acromion process and scapula. Um, and if you press down on your biceps, triceps, does that hurt?
PATIENT: Not as much, no.
DOCTOR: No, okay. And then can I get you to um, can you lift your shoulder up at all? Like to where, to the point where your fingers are touch, like reaching the ceiling?
PATIENT: No, I, I can't. I can't move it at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, so um, it sounds like you have a shoulder dislocation. Um, so we are going to do an x-ray of your shoulder joint first to make sure that it's, it's just a dislocation and there aren't any broken bones or fractures. And then um, we can resolve this by doing something called a closed reduction, um, to try to put the joint back in its place.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um, and if that closed reduction doesn't work, then uh, you may need surgery for like a, um, a weak shoulder joint, or if like ligaments um, aren't like, strong enough and it's it continues to happen.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um, otherwise, we can keep it immobilized for a few days to a few weeks, um, depending on how bad the dislocation is. Um, and then once that's removed, you can do some rehab as well to restore some range of motion. Does that sound like a good plan? Do you have any questions or concerns in the meantime?
PATIENT: Uh, no, I think that's, uh, that's great.
DOCTOR: Okay.
