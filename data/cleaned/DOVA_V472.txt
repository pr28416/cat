DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Hello.
PATIENT: Hi how are you?
DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR, nice to meet you.
PATIENT: Nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: How are you doing today?
PATIENT: Okay a little hungry.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm hungry too so.  No lunch?
PATIENT: I haven't had anything since 10 o'clock last night.
DOCTOR: Oh gosh.
PATIENT: Peanuts.
DOCTOR: Oh no, why is that?
PATIENT: Well I had to fast for my blood tests and then I went to eat and there was nothing I could eat.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Everything's you know, closed up downstairs.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Other than stuff I didn't want to eat.
DOCTOR: Right.  I'm sorry about that, so we need to take care of you and at the hospital here.  Now I haven't seen you before.  I know you've been seen by DOCTOR previously.
PATIENT: I get a different doctor every time I come so I got.
DOCTOR: I know, I know.  We'll they're trying to change things so I'm gonna be here for at least another two more years so it's a little bit better than getting a different doctor every time.
PATIENT: Now I haven't had my diabetes medicine since yesterday morning so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean that's any difference in my blood tests here.  I can't take them without some food.
DOCTOR: Right.  Okay so let's just kind of start from the beginning.  Um let's go through your medical problems.  So you have diabetes.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: How long have you had it?
PATIENT: Uh I don't even know anymore.
DOCTOR: A long time?
PATIENT: Uh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Probably uh five or six years.  Five years let's say.
DOCTOR: Okay and before we get into each of your problems I want to try and go through your medications and some other things.  Uh do you take glipizide for your diabetes?
PATIENT: They just changed my one medication from Actos.  I was on Actos for years but I talked to the doctor last time and I told her, you know everything I hear is something about bladder cancer with Actos so she changed it recently, so I take the metformin.  Well I was taking three different kinds of medicine.  Well she got me off the glyburide I think yeah.  I take well geez I don't know the name of the new one she gave, I just got that recently.
DOCTOR: Who gave that to you?  Was it someone from here?
PATIENT: I don't know her name.
DOCTOR: Oh DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But let's see what she did for you.
PATIENT: I was concerned about the Actos so she changed me.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So instead of taking three different kinds of medicine a day, I'm taking two.
DOCTOR: Right so you're on metformin one tablet twice a day.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: And then uh glipizide.
PATIENT: Glipizide is that what it is?
DOCTOR: Yeah you were supposed, you were on 5 mg and then she's gonna increase you.
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: To 10.
PATIENT: I take two of those a day.
DOCTOR: Right and she was going to increase you to 10 if your um 2 hour post meal sugars are not less than 140 um.
PATIENT: Okay I've been having trouble with my meter lately so I haven't really been checking myself.  I'm waiting for a new one.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So she's looking for 40s, 140s two hours after I eat?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Alright I'll keep that in mind.  And I couldn't take a urine test today because I just got, when I walked in I went to the bathroom cause they usually don't ask me for that.  They just usually ask me for the blood work.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I didn't uh, I didn't do that part of the test or lab work.  Plus I was on the uh Levitra and they changed it to Viagra.
DOCTOR: Viagra yeah.
PATIENT: That's another thing I want to talk to you about because I got to keep calling this in.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Every month and they gotta ask the doctor to refill the prescription.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I want that prescription refilled so I don't have to keep doing that.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: If you would do that for me please.
DOCTOR: Yeah sure.
PATIENT: Every time I call they say it's not refillable and I want it to be refillable.
DOCTOR: Understandable.  And you're um.
PATIENT: 100 mg.
DOCTOR: And your metformin I'm gonna renew that that since that has expired.
PATIENT: Please.
DOCTOR: Um your glipizide needs a refill and the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh yeah plus I'm taking the thyroid medication too.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: How's that looking on my blood work?
DOCTOR: Lets take a look.  So your, actually it looks pretty good.  Your TSH is actually a little bit low which means the thyroid hormone may be a little higher than it needs to be but I'm going to let DOCTOR manage that.
PATIENT: And how about my diabetes?  How is that going?
DOCTOR: Diabetes not looking so good.  So your glycosylated hemoglobin is 9, let's see what it was in the past.  So it was 7.2 just as early as January.  7.2 is actually not bad.  The goal is less than 7.  9 is really high.  So let me ask you, have you been able to take all of your medications?
PATIENT: Yeah, well because I was on the Actos before.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's probably the problem.  She might have to up the uh, that new one she's giving me.
DOCTOR: Right.  So you were on Actos.
PATIENT: Metformin and.
DOCTOR: So the only thing she did was she stopped Actos.
PATIENT: And gave me the new medicine but I was taking three different medicines.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Now I'm taking two.
DOCTOR: Alright let me just look.
PATIENT: So apparently the change is not good.  Cause I was consistently around 7 before on my on that, with the Actos.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I was just a little, little high before with the Actos and I don't think I've been that high for a long time.  Maybe I better go back to the Actos.
DOCTOR: Yeah let's see.  So, let me look at her note and see.  Right so she stopped your Actos and switched your glyburide to glipizide okay.  So really, the total effect is that you have a little bit less medication on board now.  Um let's see when your next appointment with her is.  You know, you're supposed to see her three months from your last appointment which was January 26th and you don't have one scheduled so I would actually call her clinic and try to schedule an appointment.
PATIENT: Yeah but when I call it's gonna take probably at least two months to get in.  I'd like to do something about this medication now.
DOCTOR: We can probably increase your glipizide to 10 and I'll check with my attending too.  Cause you're already on that metformin 1000, we can also increase that as well but uh.
PATIENT: Well she told me that it was a low dosage of the new medication she was giving me.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: And if there was a problem she would increase it but obviously something is not good.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Oh maybe I should have just stayed on the Actos I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay well I wouldn't get too stressed about it just yet um.  You know we can increase the one medication and see how that does.  There's a lot of other medications out there so you don't have to take Actos, although it does work well.  Um let me ask you a few more questions.  So and the [REDACTED] you take 5 mg every day right?
PATIENT: I take uh.
DOCTOR: One tab.
PATIENT: Two of the metformin.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Two of the other one, whatever that is, two of the other diabetes medicines.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And the one thyroid pill.
DOCTOR: Uh and let me just ask you some history questions because I've never met you before.  Uh do you smoke cigarettes?
PATIENT: No I quit 3 1/2 years ago.
DOCTOR: Good.  Um how much did you used to smoke?
PATIENT: Two packs a day.
DOCTOR: Okay. (Doctor sneezed)
PATIENT: Bless you.
DOCTOR: Thank you.  Uh any use of illicits like uh marijuana, cocaine?
PATIENT: In my youth yes, not for many years.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And are you working?
PATIENT: No I'm retired.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What did you used to do?
PATIENT: I was a surveyor.
DOCTOR: Alright and who lives with you at home?
PATIENT: Nobody.
DOCTOR: Now do you do your own cooking or do you eat out?
PATIENT: Yes I do my own cooking.
DOCTOR: So you feel like your diet is pretty good?
PATIENT: Yeah I was a cook in the Marine Corps for three years.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: So I'm a pretty good cook.
DOCTOR: Awesome.  Alright and how about exercise?  What kind of exercise do you do?
PATIENT: Yeah I walk, but I'm not, just lately, within the last year probably I've kind of slacked off more than I should.  I'm gonna get back with it here pretty soon now that the weather's warming up.  I was riding a bike and walking every day.  Of course as a surveyor that's all I did, I walked all day so.  When I was working.
DOCTOR: So you retired recently?
PATIENT: Uh a couple years ago yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay and any alcohol use?
PATIENT: Yeah I have probably 6-8 beers a week, something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's all, no hard liquor.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had periods in your life where you were drinking a lot more than that?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: When I was younger yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright any family history of any cancers?
PATIENT: My grandfather died of lung cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My father died of emphysema.  My mother heart disease.  I'm the only person in my family with diabetes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I get a little money from the VA for the Agent Orange from Vietnam.
DOCTOR: Gotcha.  Now for your diabetes do you follow with a foot doctor at all?
PATIENT: No.  I had a claim in for neuropathy in my feet and they gave me 10% of the one big toe.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I broke my foot at work years ago and it's, the VA's claiming that that's why I have pain in my other foot which is a bunch of crap but they don't want to pay me so that's why they say that.
DOCTOR: And the eye doctor, have you ever had any eye tests done?
PATIENT: Eh…Before my insurance lapsed after I retired I had a prescription for glasses.  My eyes are getting weaker too.  I don't know about the VA's policy on glasses cause I can't afford to go to an eye doctor right now so.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I need, I wear reading glasses.
DOCTOR: Let me look at your last one.  So we basically with any patient with diabetes we screen for retinopathy.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So let me see, you did have a test done in 2010 um.  And it basically said that you did not have diabetic retinopathy but your exam was abnormal cause you might have macular changes.  Does that ring a bell [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And you were supposed to be sent to Optometry.
PATIENT: I never heard anything more about it after that test.
DOCTOR: Okay so maybe I'll put in a consult um.
PATIENT: I need a new prescription for my glasses and you know they gave me, I went to you know a regular eye doctor before because I still had insurance till a year after I retired.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they gave me bifocals and I can't wear them.  I can't stand them.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I need uh, I probably need glasses.  I need some new glasses and uh not bifocals.
DOCTOR: Right okay.
PATIENT: But yes definitely, my eyes are getting weaker I can tell just by sitting at the computer or reading.
DOCTOR: Right.  Now have you ever been on medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No.  My blood pressure's always been pretty decent.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um.
PATIENT: But I would like to bring that back down closer to 7 than 9 on my diabetes you know.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: That's not good news.  I'm not used to hearing that.
DOCTOR: Alright do you get flu shots yearly?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You choose not to?
PATIENT: I choose not to.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I got one and I got sick one time, that was it for me.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: I had a bad case of the flu probably oh three or four years ago.  I had it real bad, was really sick for a week.  Five days I was in bed.
DOCTOR: Now have you ever had the shingles shot?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Is that something you are interested in?
PATIENT: Yes.  My mother had the shingles and I certainly don’t want that.
DOCTOR: Okay. I can order that for you today.
PATIENT: How often do you have to get a booster for that?
DOCTOR: You just get it once.
PATIENT: That is it?  You’re done?
DOCTOR: Hm hmm.
PATIENT: Lifetime shot?
DOCTOR: Well because we don’t give it to people until they are older anyway.
PATIENT: Wait a minute.  How old do you think I am?
DOCTOR: When you’re younger you have immunity from chicken pox.  Have you had chicken pox?
PATIENT: Yea I had everything.  German measles, measles, chicken pox.  You name it I had it all.
DOCTOR: There is also something called PSA; that is the prostate enzyme and you had one done in 2010 and it was normal at 0.88.  So it is up to you if you would like to follow that.  I would not recommend it unless you are having symptoms of you know problems urinating or
PATIENT: I have a weak stream sometimes.  I don’t know if that is from the diabetes.
DOCTOR: It is probably from the diabetes but it could also be from prostate enlargement.
PATIENT: I don’t have any prostate problems are far as I know.  I have erection problems because of diabetes.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: That is why I want to make sure you give me the prescription for the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So if you want we can follow it, the PSA as well.
PATIENT: Well that is up to you.  I mean what do you think [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: I can order it for the next time you come in [REDACTED] and we will make sure it is not rising.
PATIENT: Well right, right. I mean I take a blood test anyways so I don’t see any harm in it.  Also I will take the urine test the next time I come in too.
DOCTOR: Alright, and do you know if you have ever been screened for abdominal aortic aneurysm?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No you have not or [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don’t think that I have.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So for anybody who is a previous smoker and male, we do one screening test after the age of 65.  Basically it shows us an aneurysm in your belly.
PATIENT: I am 63.
DOCTOR: Right.  We have to document that we talked to you about this and that you’d be willing to do it at some point.
PATIENT: I am going to do it yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now um okay, so I'm going to have to talk to my attending about a couple of things in terms of your eyeglasses um and then getting you in to see the eye doctor and then your diabetes medications.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um and then I'll order your shingles shot as well.
PATIENT: Like I said here, if they have to, I know just by phone to get in to see the doctor it takes at least a couple of months and I don't want to wait that long for the diabetes medicine you know.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: If that's worse.
DOCTOR: Right.  Alright, let me have you sit up here for me and I'll get you examined.  I'll listen to your neck first okay.  Just going to listen to your heart.  Alright deep breaths in and out, through your mouth.  Alright can you open your mouth and stick out your tongue.  Okay.  I’m just going to feel your pulse.  Okay do you mind taking your shoes and socks off for me?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: We'll do a quick foot exam.  Have you ever had one of these tests done?  Monofilament?  Basically what I'm gonna do, I'm going to have you close your eyes and I'm going to poke you in six spots and you need to tell me which toe you feel it in.
PATIENT: Oh yeah I've it done several times.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm sure you have.  Anybody with diabetes needs to do this, especially if you're not seeing a foot doctor we do it at least.
PATIENT: I had a lot of, I have some numbness.
DOCTOR: Okay relax your leg for me completely.  Relax it.
PATIENT: It's relaxed.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright close your eyes and tell me if you can feel this.
PATIENT: I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Where?
PATIENT: Bottom of my foot.
DOCTOR: Well you got to tell me which toe.
PATIENT: It doesn't feel like my toe, it feels like my foot.
DOCTOR: So below which foot?
PATIENT: Below my, I don't know I mean I can't tell.
DOCTOR: Can you tell where this one is?
PATIENT: The little one I think.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Big one.  Below the bigger one or second one I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay is this usually where you have your numbness in this area?
PATIENT: No it's on this foot.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Right direction.
PATIENT: Well yeah I got it on the big toe on here, on this one.
DOCTOR: Yes.  Okay, relax your foot, your left.  Don't look.  Can you feel this?
PATIENT: A little.  I don't know which toe, second toe, I don't.
DOCTOR: You feel it but you can't tell me where?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: This is the one I got crushed.  This foot was completely crushed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I had a four inch steel pin through my big toe I had no joint in that toe.
DOCTOR: Oh boy.
PATIENT: Okay I got it completely crushed.  I cut the, severed the tendons in between my first two toes there.  I had a puncture wound on top of it.
DOCTOR: Oh boy.
PATIENT: And my whole foot is.
DOCTOR: Yeah can you feel my fingers here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Here's the numb part is right here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I was run over by a machine that weighed tons.
DOCTOR: Oh my goodness.  Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah the big toe on the right foot is the problem.  But the circulation seems to be okay I don't know.  Are you finished?
DOCTOR: Yes.  I'm going to go talk to my attending and then I'll be back.
PATIENT: Okay.  Yeah like I say you're gonna give me the prescription for the Viagra so I don't have to keep calling in?
DOCTOR: Yes I just put it in.  They don't let you pick it up unfortunately.
PATIENT: No they mail it to me.
DOCTOR: They'll send it through the mail yeah.
PATIENT: Oh that's fine.  It's just that every month that I call they tell me it's not refillable.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I just want it to be refillable so I don't have to go through that, plus I'd like to get my diabetes medicine straightened out as soon as possible too.
DOCTOR: Absolutely.
(DOCTOR OUT:  109:20  DOCTOR IN:  118:25)
DOCTOR: Hey okay a few things, so um I'm going to put in a referral to the Eye Clinic for you.  I don't know what they can or can't do but we'll see.  Um and then for you're feet, I'm actually going to put in a referral to Podiatry as well, even though some of the abnormalities on your exam may just from the history of you know the trauma to your feet.  But I do want them to take a look just to make sure.  Um and then also you're um, for your diabetes, call the Clinic today and tell them you were supposed to be seen in three months and hopefully they can get you in sooner but in the meantime I will increase your glipizide to 7.5 twice a day.  The reason for that is because we don't, you haven't been checking your blood sugars at home right?  So what's the story with the glucometer cause I'm looking in the notes and it looks like two months ago she had given you a phone number to call.
PATIENT: Yeah I called them and I'm still waiting.
DOCTOR: Oh really.  Do you want that number again?  Maybe you should.
PATIENT: Yeah I'll call them again.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: What now, the medicine that I'm taking, should I take more of those than I already have?
DOCTOR: Right, so I'm going to do, I'm going to change it to 7.5 um so you can actually pick that up maybe at the Pharmacy today um.
PATIENT: Just have them mail it to me because I have it at home now.
DOCTOR: Oh sure.
PATIENT: Can I just take more of what I have?
DOCTOR: Sure, sure.  You are allowed to do that.  And then the other thing um.
PATIENT: Yeah because I just got a new prescription for that.
DOCTOR: Right, okay.  That's not a problem.
PATIENT: How much do I take?
DOCTOR: 7.5.
PATIENT: Which is what?
DOCTOR: So you are taking.
PATIENT: How many pills?
DOCTOR: Right now you're taking 5 mg twice a day.
PATIENT: Two pills I take.
DOCTOR: So you take one pill twice a day right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Right.  So you would take 1 1/2 twice a day.
PATIENT: One and a half.
DOCTOR: Or you could wait for five or six days until you get the new medication sent to you so there's no confusion.
PATIENT: I don't take four of them, three of them?
DOCTOR: Well because you've had.
PATIENT: How many do I take?
DOCTOR: The dose already, once I give you the 7 1/2, let me see what happens when I do that one.
PATIENT: If I take three of those a day it'll be the same thing right?
DOCTOR: Uh kind of.  You're supposed to uh, you're supposed to take it twice a day because of the way it works so I would not recommend you taking it that way but let me, when I order it um okay 7.5.
PATIENT: Or I could take two in the morning and one later on during the day maybe, something like that?
DOCTOR: So yeah it's going to make you take 1 1/2 tabs twice a day.  That's the only way, they don't have 7.5 tabs.
PATIENT: Three total for the day.
DOCTOR: Yeah so you cut one in half and take half in the morning and half in the evening.  You have to take it that way because of the way the medication works.  You can't take too much at once and a little bit you know at night because your sugar is going to change and vary as well.
PATIENT: In the meantime you're going to add, you're going to give me a different prescription right?
DOCTOR: Yeah I just ordered it.  So even the different ones they're gonna make you take one and a half cause there's no such thing as a 7.5 pill here at the VA.  Um, now I wanted to ask if you'd be interested in talking to the MOVE Clinic.  I don't know if you've ever done that before.
PATIENT: What's that's about?
DOCTOR: So basically um it's a clinic where they discuss, it's kind of like an exercise program but they also discuss diet and.
PATIENT: No I know what to do.  I just got to get off my butt and do it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think I had a, I cancelled that one time a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: No I know what I have to do.
DOCTOR: And then the other thing I wanted to talk to you too about is that your liver enzymes are slightly elevated and it looks like, if I go back.
PATIENT: They were before too I think and I think.
DOCTOR: They, they’ve always been elevated but not this high so they're kind of going up a little bit.
PATIENT: Okay and the doctor told me that that thyroid medicine.
DOCTOR: Will do that.
PATIENT: Could be a problem.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So it could be from that and the other thing we can do is do a liver ultrasound to make sure there is no abnormalities on that, any cysts or masses or um any fibrosis.
PATIENT: Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I will order that for you as well.
PATIENT: She told me if I had any pains in my side.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That to stop taking that thyroid medicine.
DOCTOR: Have you had any pains?
PATIENT: I had a little bit when I first started taking it, nothing real serious but.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I've never had any trouble with my liver before as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Let me order your shingles shot as well.
PATIENT: Okay so I can go ahead and increase this, the diabetes medicine.
DOCTOR: You can do that today.
PATIENT: And you're going to order me a different dosage right?
DOCTOR: Correct.  You should have that within a week.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I want you to call that number to get another glucometer and if you have any problems call back here and we can try to work on that.  Um.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now the new prescription what, that'll still be 1 1/2, that'll still be 1 1/2.
DOCTOR: It'll be the same exact thing that you're gonna take starting today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But it'll say on the bottle 1 1/2.
PATIENT: Okay.  I don't like to hear that, you know I thought I was getting the diabetes pretty much under control here because I was always right around 7.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That doesn't make me too happy to hear that it's up to 9, even though I don't really know what I'm talking about with these numbers but it's.
DOCTOR: Alright I'm going to order this uh.
PATIENT: I had my heart checked and I had an ultrasound done on my chest and all that stuff before.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Not my liver.  Now I never really have any pain.  Like I said when I first started taking it, thyroid medicine, I thought I felt a little dull pain a few times but nothing severe and I haven't had it for a while so.
DOCTOR: Alright, so let me see if I can find a nurse who can give you the zoster shot.  I'm actually going to have you walk out here with me.
PATIENT: Okay.  Oops, I forgot think I dropped my glasses.  I got my glasses here.
DOCTOR: Alright she's going to help you out with the shot you get today and then she'll get you scheduled with your ultrasound for you.
PATIENT: And the glasses and the whole business.
DOCTOR: I'll do all of that, there's a clinic who will call you and can get you in.
PATIENT: Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright take care.
PATIENT: Nice to meet you thank you.
DOCTOR: I'll see you in a few months okay.
PATIENT: Thank you.
PATIENT: 126:4
Time is 4:40.
