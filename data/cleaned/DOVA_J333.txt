DOCTOR: Yeah.  So everything, what’s the thing that’s bothering, what other things have been bothering you?
PATIENT: What about the esophagus you know.

DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And this lousy little cough I got.
DOCTOR: Alright, so.
PATIENT: Donna.
DOCTOR: Anything from the heartburn, is anything helping you?  Do we have you on any coating?
PATIENT: They gave me that three in one thing, that pink stuff.
SECOND PERSON J333
Hello doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh hi, how you doing?
PATIENT: It's okay but it doesn't last you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's quick dissolving like.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I think a viscus lidocaine that might help and you're completely done with the radiation and at this point you have had the chemo.
PATIENT: Everything is done.
DOCTOR: And they're going to do a CAT scan in a couple months.
PATIENT: In three months, yeah a couple months.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They couldn't find anything, everything is gone.
DOCTOR: Great.
PATIENT: Yeah, God almighty yeah.
DOCTOR: You know it's been a.
PATIENT: Tough fight.
DOCTOR: Yeah it has, especially with that pneumonia and everything.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I'd like you to go through and see if there are some of those medications I could stop taking.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know there's so many of them.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm losing track.
DOCTOR: Oh I know.  Alright so, let's see.  So you need the magnesium cause it's been low.
PATIENT: Definitely so.
DOCTOR: I think might be low because of the chemo.  Um and then you're on this Neutra-Phos which is the packet.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I think that's okay.  Um your cough syrup.
PATIENT: I gotta have that.
DOCTOR: We'll continue that.  Tramadol are you taking that at all?
SECOND PERSON J333
That's for the pain, not at all now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Um okay, get rid of that.  Albuterol inhaler, that inhaler has that been helping at all?
PATIENT: For what, what is that for?
DOCTOR: Like the puffer you take.
PATIENT: Oh I haven't been using that.
DOCTOR: Yeah has it ever helped you?  Alright we can get rid of it.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Uh you know I remember.  It's one of those things it's not going to hurt, but it doesn't sound like it's doing anything for you.  Uh the omeprazole or Prilosec?
PATIENT: Prilosec I need it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you need that.  Uh okay, are you still taking the, there's some of these chemo medications they gave you the prochlorperazine for nausea.
PATIENT: I didn't have any nausea on it.
SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah you had some in the beginning.
PATIENT: Just in the beginning.
SECOND PERSON J333
You know what that actually made him more nauseous.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON J333
You was taking that remember?
PATIENT: Yeah I know.
SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah.
PATIENT: I'd take it before I'd eat and before I could eat I was throwing it up.
DOCTOR: Okay, atenolol?
PATIENT: Yeah I have to have that.
DOCTOR: Yeah blood pressure.  So Lasix?
PATIENT: What is that?
DOCTOR: That's uh furosemide, it's a water pill.
SECOND PERSON J333
Oh he's not taking it right now.  The doctors told him to stop it.
PATIENT: To stop it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh the Colace or Docusate for stools, for constipation?
PATIENT: No I need help there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Those are not working.
DOCTOR: Okay so you need something stronger.
SECOND PERSON J333
But they used to work from the beginning though right?
PATIENT: No, no, no.  It's just the.
SECOND PERSON J333
For the very beginning they do a little bit.
PATIENT: Yeah the first time I took them, I thought oh this is great, but it didn't happen, it didn't happen again.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] and then do you need any of these uh dressings and things?  They pulled the PICC line out right?
SECOND PERSON J333
Yes they did that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you don't need any of these alcohol.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON J333
Can you eliminate all this from the computer so when they give a print-out we'll have just [REDACTED].
PATIENT: He's doing it now.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well he'll get a print out but after he gets rid of them.
DOCTOR: You don't need any of this IV stuff.
SECOND PERSON J333
No.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Still on the metformin?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: The simvastatin?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Flomax?
PATIENT: Flomax I don't know.
SECOND PERSON J333
What was that for?
DOCTOR: It's for trouble, if you're having trouble urinating um.
PATIENT: No in fact I urinate too much at night.
DOCTOR: Well that's the thing; you're waking up to urinate?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Well this is supposed to help you empty your, when you go you empty your bladder all the way.  Sometimes what happens if the prostate is big you have and it's not emptying all the way you get just kind of, you're always halfway full and you end up going all the time.
SECOND PERSON J333
And that makes you get up all the time.
PATIENT: But it seems like I go enough until I empty out as much as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh I'll leave it on there, if you don't want it.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: For now and you could and then you're giving yourself and these are just the insulin and stuff um… the diabetes check.
PATIENT: Oh I want to tell you about that, remember with the glipizide.
SECOND PERSON J333
Glipizide.
DOCTOR: Glipizide.
PATIENT: Glipizide, I'm taking two pills in the morning and one in the evening.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that's working out beautifully.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know remember we were going real low.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So a half wasn't doing it.
SECOND PERSON J333
You were right then.
PATIENT: Remember we tried a half and it wasn't doing.
SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah.
PATIENT: So I started a full pill and that's been working great.  In the morning I'm 109, 111.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Right on the number.
DOCTOR: So 20 in the morning and 10 at night.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright and then the metformin still.
PATIENT: Yeah it's working.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Now for the stool softener uh, so you're taking the Docusate.  You want to try something, have you ever tried MiraLax?  Uh it's something you know, it's kind of something to take it's like a last resort.  So here, let me give, I'm going to give you a pill that'll keep things, will get things moving.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so the Docusate is just a stool softener and it's not.
PATIENT: It's not.
DOCTOR: It's not a very strong one um.  Then there's a laxative called Senna which you can take in a pill form.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I'm gonna give you that one and then I'm gonna also give you a prescription for MiraLax, which is if things get backed up you can take uh one of these MiraLax things and that's uh, that's to get things moving okay.
PATIENT: See I've been drinking prune juice.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And that helps.
DOCTOR: Yeah that'll help too.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But uh this is you know a little bit stronger um.  I would keep doing the Colace, you can just take that every day, it'll just keep things a little moving but.
PATIENT: Cause I normally don't go like every three days or four days sometimes.  That's been a problem too.
SECOND PERSON J333
Eat some more prunes. [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Do you want this delivered or do you want to pick it up today?
PATIENT: Uh they can deliver it; I got enough stuff to keep me going.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I got some prune juice left.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Then the MiraLax, polyethylene glycol is what it's called.  It'll come in these packets that you just put in a glass of water and just take that as needed for constipation.  So the cough, you know we're, there's not much else we can do for it.  I just hope that it gets a little bit better after things calm down a little bit and um if it's, you know we'll keep the cough syrup going and uh you know.  I think you know it's probably, it is probably from the mass and we know that.  I don't think it's a pneumonia.
PATIENT: Oh no, it's definitely that.
DOCTOR: And uh.
PATIENT: Cause there's hardly any phlegm with it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's just.
DOCTOR: It's just irritating.
PATIENT: Tickling and you know.
DOCTOR: So I, you know I think the best thing to do is the cough syrup for that um.  I don't think DOCTOR had any further ideas.
PATIENT: Well she sent me what four bottles of cough syrup.
SECOND PERSON J333
Uh-huh yesterday.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Does the cough syrup help?
PATIENT: I haven't started it yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we'll try that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: I got four bottles.  Don't order me anymore.
SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah, actually you know, he took it before.  But you gotta take it I guess every four hours regularly, you know for it to help.
DOCTOR: Yeah and it's going to be this stuff that's a little bit sedating um so you just got to watch it.  You know, don't drive with it if you're taking it you know.
SECOND PERSON J333
No.  Is it addictive doctor?  No?
DOCTOR: Not really um.  It's just uh, it might knock you out a little bit but there's not.
SECOND PERSON J333
[REDACTED] okay, I had bronchitis a couple weeks ago and I took the antibiotics and all of the and I still had a bad cough you know and I started taking NyQuil at night, like a teaspoon of it before I go to bed.  So for ten nights I'm sleeping nice without waking up.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
SECOND PERSON J333
Well the one night I didn't take it, I woke up early.
DOCTOR: No I'm not too worried about him becoming uh.
PATIENT: Yeah.  And you know me when it comes to medicines.  As soon as I can stop it, I stop it.
DOCTOR: If you didn't need it, I mean it.
PATIENT: Right exactly.
SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you taking anything for the, what are you taking for the heartburn and uh esophageal?
PATIENT: The syrup?
DOCTOR: Yeah nothing okay.
PATIENT: They gave me, like I say this pink stuff in this big bottle.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But that ain't doing it.  I mean it's okay for about ten minutes or so and if I would go out to dinner or something, by the time I'm finished with my dinner it's doing nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I mean I think that's all from the radiation you know.
PATIENT: Well that's what everybody said.
DOCTOR: It'll be getting better.
SECOND PERSON J333
How long does it take a year or?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON J333
No not that long.
DOCTOR: Your last treatment was on when, it was about uh.
SECOND PERSON J333
Five, six weeks ago, something like.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay so you still have that bottle of pink stuff?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: So when you go out to dinner, I mean you can take it and it'll last for about ten minutes okay um and do you have pain pills that you can take?
PATIENT: Yes.
SECOND PERSON J333
He has Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Yeah sometimes the Vicodin will help a little bit if you take it prior.
PATIENT: Prior.
DOCTOR: To meals you know and just try to kind of brace, just till it's numbed down, kind of like this.
PATIENT: Cause they said that can also cause the.
DOCTOR: Constipation.
PATIENT: That was funny.
SECOND PERSON J333
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON J333
Better start eating more vegetables and fruits though.
PATIENT: Oh you and your vegetables.
DOCTOR: But I'm hoping that that should get better.  The more we move away from the radiation.  It's just lingering a little while.
PATIENT: But you know I can't imagine how that pain is when I start eating and it locks up there you know when I swallow.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it gets down to a certain point and then I could feel it like you know there.  If I try to sip some water to get it down.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well when the water hits it, oh it's like somebody shoved a poker down there, hot poker.
SECOND PERSON J333
Oh my God.
PATIENT: It's really hard and I don't know what to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now it does go down.  It'll finally let go and then the pain is gone.
DOCTOR: Alright well let me see if I can talk to, I'll talk to some of our cancer doctors and see if there's something else that we can think of uh.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: After this, um I'm actually on the Hemoc Service right now so I'll see doctors, a couple of the doctors a little later today.  I'll see if they have any other ideas of what we can do and how long we can expect this to go on.
PATIENT: Oh that would be nice.
DOCTOR: Uh I don't know if I'm, I mean I don't want to promise anything.
PATIENT: Oh right.
DOCTOR: Um and uh alright no fevers or chills or anything like that?  Uh cough is pretty much dry at this point.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh alright and uh.
PATIENT: I mean I'm putting on weight.  I put on a few more pounds.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I'm doing a lot more things that I couldn't do before.
DOCTOR: Okay, great.
PATIENT: Yeah so.
DOCTOR: That's the key.
PATIENT: So it's working out.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Slowly.
DOCTOR: Yeah so yeah, the weight is coming up a little bit.
SECOND PERSON J333
What's the weight, how much he weigh now?
DOCTOR: 149.2, so it was 147 at the lowest.
SECOND PERSON J333
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So it's starting up.
PATIENT: Yeah we're getting it up there.
DOCTOR: Alright want to just have a seat up here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Give me a deep breath.  Okay, breathe normally.  Any swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: No.  I'm doing okay.
DOCTOR: Alright uh so.  I'm gonna go talk to the boss and see if they're gonna want to do this.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: This assessment, so I'll show you where it is when I come back.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  49:11  DOCTOR IN:  59:02)
DOCTOR: Alright so, do you have any antibiotics at home in case you need them?
PATIENT: The what?
SECOND PERSON J333
Antibiotics, we don't have any more.
DOCTOR: Okay, well you know if you start having fevers, chills or anything like that uh you know, if that happens.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: You're at risk for getting pneumonias okay, you understand.  Because this obstruction, that's what's causing the cough.  But sometimes if you can't clear up, you're not going to be, you know what I mean so you're at risk for getting pneumonias and you might not be able to tolerate it.
PATIENT: Well we just took the antibiotics for seven days.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  So the same antibiotic that you took.
SECOND PERSON J333
Well if you can give him another prescription then.
DOCTOR: And we still want you to, but I want you to be.  You know if you start having any fevers or chills or the cough is getting worse.  If you're just feeling like body aches or feeling sick you need to call us immediately okay and then we'll get you some antibiotics.
SECOND PERSON J333
Oh you can't prescribe him any right now?
DOCTOR: Well I can give it, if you want I can give you, what I can do is have them mail you a prescription, so you can have it at home and take it in case you need it.
SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah that'll be good.
DOCTOR: But I want you, if you do get to the point where you're gonna take them, I want you to call us yeah.
PATIENT: If I have to take them I'll get hold of you.
DOCTOR: So let us know if you end up taking the antibiotics, just in case.
PATIENT: So when do I get over this hump with the pneumonia?
DOCTOR: Well no, no I'm just saying, I don't think you have a pneumonia right now.
PATIENT: Oh.
SECOND PERSON J333
No but he needs the, it's when the, like when he won't be susceptible anymore.
DOCTOR: Yeah your lungs are, you know you have a blockage in one of them so you know the lung comes down like this you know um, breaks off a couple of different ways.
SECOND PERSON J333
And the blockage is still from the tumor right?
DOCTOR: Tumor and just scar.  You know we got this.
SECOND PERSON J333
The scar tissue.
DOCTOR: From all the radiation so you know this is kind of where the tumor was, it was in this ball park like on the right side so you got the tumor all shrunk down, so it's shriveled down but this airway here is still blocked you know partly.  So you're, you know what I'm worried about is if you get another infection you know, past this blockage, like so all the bacteria's down here, like just sits here and then you know and you're not able to clear it because it's blocked then we need to make sure you're getting the antibiotics okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But I think um oh um, but I don't think you need any now you know.
SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah.
DOCTOR: You will know yourself if you're getting sick.
SECOND PERSON J333
So he should be very careful coming in contact with people that are sick.
DOCTOR: Well yeah I think that's uh.
PATIENT: But that goes for everybody.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um.
SECOND PERSON J333
So wash your hands often and all that.
PATIENT: I do you know I always do that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah.
PATIENT: Every place I go I squirt.
DOCTOR: So I'm going to give you a script for that just in case you need it.
PATIENT: That'd be good.
DOCTOR: To kind of.
PATIENT: Cause sometimes you now you try to call and you can't get through and then.
DOCTOR: Oh I know, that's what.
SECOND PERSON J333
Or it's a weekend.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright and then let's say four months or if you need something else you know you can always call for something.
