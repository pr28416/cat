DOCTOR: [REDACTED] make you come in.
PATIENT: Right usually twice a year.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: To see my primary caregiver but I had other, because they called me first yeah [REDACTED] decide my other isseus in the meantime I need to see the dentist and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh yeah.
PATIENT: And I need a referral to the dentist and I been complaining to uh when I come to the Emergency Room cause I been having chest pain.
DOCTOR: Yeah they said that it wasn't anything [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah but after a while I'm still having chest pain plus my left arm goes numb.
DOCTOR: Are you still having that now?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Right now?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Like right now?
PATIENT: Yeah it's, you know when I really notice it is when I'm sitting, I'm sitting and the angle I'm sitting at is like you know first it feels like maybe you've strained a muscle then it starts hurting then my left arm goes numb and the circulation [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So this is the same thing you had in the ER?
PATIENT: Right, yeah but I been telling them like for the last, you know for a long time.
DOCTOR: So you had a stress test in May that was normal.
PATIENT: Yeah that was last May.
DOCTOR: Um and all your EKGs are normal.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So it doesn't sound like it's your heart.
PATIENT: Yeah it seemed like, I don't know if it's like a muscle part or I was wondering maybe you know they had seen some type of tissues that was in my lungs you know now that's something do I have cancer, is that causing the pain, do I have a tumor?  You know so I'm just wondering what you call it because it just keeps bugging me.  You know they gave me blood cultures and.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Everything you know the last time I was over at the Emergency Room the last time.
DOCTOR: Everything was totally normal.
PATIENT: Yeah, it was everything was normal.  I said then why am I still having pain and.
DOCTOR: What did she say?
PATIENT: She's said she didn't know because all your tests come back as normal.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean does it hurt if you push on it?
PATIENT: Huh?  Here's what I show, sitting I first started out and I'm sitting dang you know it started hurting and I sit up and I take the pressure off.
DOCTOR: Does it get better when you move around?
PATIENT: I move around and I change positions.
DOCTOR: It gets better.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Sounds like it’s a muscle, you know a pulled muscle.
PATIENT: You know, but it's been like this going on year.  But of course I came in pain recently, you know before I came in - my left arm, you know just like I told you it gets numb, like needles and pins.
DOCTOR: Do you feel weak in that left arm?
PATIENT: Huh.  It’s not weak, it’s like, you know I lose sensation you know it’s like, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Like every day or?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] circulation.
DOCTOR: How often does that happen?
PATIENT: That’s every day.
DOCTOR: Like right now?
PATIENT: Huh?  Right now it's not bothering; I just threw it across, see if maybe uh I move my arm you know too much and the wrong angle, because I had surgery back in 2006.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: On this arm.
DOCTOR: So if you had it [REDACTED] I bet it's a little bit of the nerve that's irritated.
PATIENT: Yeah because you know [REDACTED] when I came in when I had the surgery on this, right I had lost all function of this arm.
DOCTOR: Hmm, this is post-surgical.
PATIENT: Alright, now this is bothering.  Kind of like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Sometimes it's like needles and pins all up and down my arm because it's [REDACTED].  [REDACTED] any pain, [REDACTED] you know like what I used to do with the type of work I was doing then you know I was trying to [REDACTED].  So the only thing I connect it to you know was maybe the surgery you know, cause uh after surgery I had a lot of occupational therapy.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Yeah.
PATIENT: You know rebuild my muscle up cause I had to hold my arm up when I came here before the surgery and like the doctor said, you know, gave me those tests and then they did a probe you know they took blood, they [REDACTED], biopsies, five needle prong, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: We're going to do surgery blah blah and now I mean I've already had one surgery when they removed a tumor [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well [REDACTED] new symptoms.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Nothing new is going on.
PATIENT: No this is, these two, the chest and the arm and you know I need to see a dentist, not like I want to but to check what you know when I try sometime when I try to eat or drink something or liquids you know there's a pain in my gums, I don't know what that, but I have to see a dentist that had.
DOCTOR: Any fevers or chills or big lumps or bumps anywhere?
PATIENT: No just pain.  Cause I would try to get a referral back cause I need to get some partials or maybe just this little a tooth that I need to have extracted, it broke off.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And maybe the you know with if it increases are getting in my system or [REDACTED] pain for this.
DOCTOR: Now um and you're followed by Oncology for, what did you last see the oncologist for?

DOCTOR: Oh you just have an enlarged prostate.
PATIENT: Right they gave the medicine for you know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But why did you see the oncologist for that?
PATIENT: Well the program I was in that's what they've been sending me to cause see I went up, I'm in a program that uh gives you a multivitamin and at that time like it would be either selenium to see if it had any affect on decreasing your chances of you know getting prostate cancer.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: But I've been in that program like for seven years.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: Yeah so I had a colonoscopy, I had that just once a year, I had a prostate exam so like I had a prostate exam.
DOCTOR: Okay, gotcha, gotcha.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: So I was required, so I was asking them about you know the tumor cause they seen a growth and they checked it before and said it was benign then I was wondering could I have cancer which would have affected me.
DOCTOR: Your chest x-ray in December was completely normal.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Guess I know before 200@, because like I had this surgery.
DOCTOR: Last year.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um and you've got some fibrosis in your lungs.

DOCTOR: Your lungs are becoming stiff and they're not moving that well with air.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And your smoking will continue to make it worse.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Okay I'm glad you told me that.
DOCTOR: I mean that's what's going on here yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I been thinking [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Have you been [REDACTED] substances?
PATIENT: Yeah that's what kind of led me to surgery back in 2006 because I had the episode, you know I was doing rehab construction and so like one time we had to remove you know like we cleaned some stuff from this building so we used some caustic chemicals and I had to put on you know a protective suit and the doctor was saying DOCTOR said maybe you know it had seeped through and affected my renal system cause I had this tumor that popped up you know on my left arm, I couldn't use it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I broke out in a rash.  For two days I couldn't see my eyes swole shut you know.  So when I came in to see them because it happened the same time I was seeing my regular physician which was DOCTOR then.  You know he rushed me to the Emergency Room and that's when I thought this is why my system is breaking down.
DOCTOR: Oh okay yeah, I see.
PATIENT: I lost weight, you know I couldn't eat.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Couldn't do nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah I was really out of it.
DOCTOR: We need to get you to stop smoking.
PATIENT: I need to do that for sure.  Especially since you alerted me to the fibrosis part and all the pain from this side.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I'm still thinking about because they had you know [REDACTED] give me x-rays back in 2006 where they wanted to do exploratory surgery but the lady that was in charge of me then said no he just came out of surgery that's benign, blah, blah and I was dealing with the kid saying okay we got Hepatis C, we have to deal with this.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: And I didn't know I had that cause they didn't inform me.
DOCTOR: Your head, what's going on with that?
