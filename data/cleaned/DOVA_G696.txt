DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yeah, how you doing doc?
DOCTOR: Good to see you.  Have a seat.  How you been?
PATIENT: Um okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I found out that sag in my bag.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: It’s a bunch of sperm.
PATIENT: Um yeah, no.
DOCTOR: When did they say it was? That’s what the note says.
PATIENT: It says that?
DOCTOR: Yeah what did they say it is?
PATIENT: That's not what they told me.  They said it was a uh a uh.
DOCTOR: An abscess?
PATIENT: Not a cyst but something on my sperm delivery system.  What else, it's a liposil thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah it is a cyst.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because a cyst is basically liquid that's benign first of all.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You don't have to worry about anything serious there um but it can be filled with either like water um, it can blocked up sperm, is why it's filled up like that.  In either case I know that they had offered [REDACTED].  If they offered to lump it off.
PATIENT: No they didn't.  They said that that would be elective surgery. I can’t afford that.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah. That’s the thing, that's the thing so um did they say they wanted to follow up with you though?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  There's no way you can maybe talk to Social Work to see you can get this done?
PATIENT: Oh I don't know I mean I tried to talk to the social worker and then everybody at the Urology Clinic told me oh I don't know who to call.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, that’s the thing.  You know we have, I think its Financial Services or something like that that may be able to help you out with this.  I know it's an elective surgery.
PATIENT: I mean like right now, right now I have, see I usually pay all my VA bills.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: There's my taxes, I’m gonna get my taxes and I mean I haven't paid since last April so I got all the prescriptions and all the doctors and I got extra doctor visits in here.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Because of my problem.
DOCTOR: Right.  I know, I know.
PATIENT: So the VA bill is getting kind of big.
DOCTOR: Yeah right.
PATIENT: So I mean I could probably stand to see the social worker just [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah that's not a bad idea.  I mean let me see if I can have them talk to you and see if they can help out.  Um how have you been otherwise?
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: Have you been doing okay?
PATIENT: I stopped taking my pain medicines for a little while.
DOCTOR: Is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah I slowed down uh and stopped completely [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And how'd it go?
PATIENT: Well I've been off of it for a week and it's not going very good at all.  So I want to get back on it.
DOCTOR: I [REDACTED] you know that, right?
PATIENT: You did.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I didn't see the name on the list when I came in.
DOCTOR: Um I filled it up.
PATIENT: Today?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I hope they didn't mail it out.
DOCTOR: They can't, they don't mail morphine out.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So if you still want to get it it is in there.
PATIENT: Okay cause I didn't see my name on the board so maybe, maybe they were still getting the dose.  Did you drop them off today?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So, do check.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yeah you should be able to get it.
PATIENT: Thank you.  I didn't bother to call this month because I figured whether you were on top of it or not I would get it straightened out when I come in to see you.
DOCTOR: Yeah no you're always, its part of this [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: You’ve been her long enough.
PATIENT: So I won't have to call anymore?
DOCTOR: Well I would still call.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just to make sure.
PATIENT: Okay.  Cause usually when I’m not seeing you, I call about 10 days ahead of time.
DOCTOR: Cause it's your pain.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So um, I'm not the one in pain so sometimes I'm not [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um okay so that's that.  Do you [REDACTED] sometimes that the pain is controlled with the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's great.  Um do you have anything [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I've having.  The neuropathy in my feet is getting worse.
DOCTOR: Are you still seeing Neurology?
PATIENT: I've got an appointment with DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: This afternoon at 3:30.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You're saw them last time in the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And uh I had that colonoscopy scheduled.
DOCTOR: What happened?
PATIENT: I took all the stuff.  I sat on the toilet all night.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then in my morning my wife was feeling so terrible and she couldn’t take me and I went through the worst part of it.
DOCTOR: The worst part of it is the prep.
PATIENT: Yeah I went through the worst part of it and then I couldn't go.
DOCTOR: I read the note and went, “No!”[REDACTED] procedure.Okay, they said they are still willing to do it. Do you want it?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  I gotta have it done. I mean the stuff.  My father had.
DOCTOR: Your father had colon cancer?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh goodness and you're 58 okay.  So we'll do it sometime.
PATIENT: I mean I haven't had one for sort of like five years at least.
DOCTOR: Yeah, well you've had one before?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Not here.
DOCTOR: Oh [REDACTED] it wasn't here.  That's right [REDACTED] yeah.  Um okay so I'll put that back in.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Put it back in.  What else we got going on here?  Uh, oh they want some other stuff here.  Um, flu shot, do you have one?
PATIENT: I had them both.
DOCTOR: Yep, yep, [REDACTED] good.  And your cholesterol is very good I'm not going to recheck that.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: 43?
DOCTOR: Yes.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I know.  I've been active all of my life and it's low enough for me.
DOCTOR: Yeah definitely, definitely.  Your sugars are very well controlled too.
PATIENT: Are they?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I want to take a look at you.
PATIENT: In spite of the doctor, I mean [REDACTED] for sleep.
DOCTOR: Yeah I have a number from 2009 um that tells me what it's been in the last three months in 2009 and you've been well controlled.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep what you're doing up, cause you know keep watching your diet and watching out for fat thing [REDACTED] that kind of thing because as long as you have [REDACTED] that makes your heart is working well.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know.  Lean forward for me, deep breath, good, breathe, breathe, out and in, out.  You know this is the hardest thing to talk about how's the smoking going?
PATIENT: I'm thinking of quitting.  I have actually am.
DOCTOR: Are you there yet?
PATIENT: This new tax [REDACTED] you know this is [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: First of all you'd save a lot of money um you know.
PATIENT: I don't want to do the classes Thursday because it's too far for me to drive.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know and with me on a limited income uh I can't afford to come over here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Two or three times a week.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The first question is though do you want to quit?  If you don't, I can't really talk much more.  I can tell you why you should quit and maybe that would convince you.
PATIENT: I've been thinking in the last week yes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Okay, okay.  Um, well the important thing is you know you're quitting.  I can't stress to you, you have such real disease with your legs and all that kind of thing.  Smoking only exacerbates these problems and adds more problems.  Smoking one of the things it does in terms of your legs is it clamps down your vessels and when you walk it gives you even more pain in your vessels there.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The blood can’t get to them and then now I don't know what the pain comes from, especially. Lung cancer.  I'm sure you know about that.  The chance of lung cancer is dramatically higher than normal people.  Other disease is called COPD, an obstructive problem.  I don't know if you get [REDACTED] when you walk around at all.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I've been walking all my life.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it doesn't bother me.
DOCTOR: So if you do any activities or anything a or have a cough or [REDACTED] okay so that's probably a bronchitis type of thing.  Um so not only the heart disease, hypertension, kidney disease, stroke all these things are increased with smoking.  I can’t tell you the importance of smoking.  I can't emphasize that enough.  What you can try to do is, if you're willing to quit.  You have to be realistic.  How much you smoke a day?
PATIENT: A pack.
DOCTOR: Um do you want to try nicotine patches or the gum?
PATIENT: No but my wife said that that's the only thing that ever worked for her.
DOCTOR: There's multiple things you can try the patches, you could try the gum, you could try the lozenges, you can try Chantix, but the first in the line of things is to try nicotine replacement.  So you could start with the patch.  I'll give a two week trial of the patch okay and by the end of the two weeks you should be stopped.  Now that's a lofty goal, that's a lofty goal okay.  Cessation of smoking is the only way to do this but let’s try to do the patch okay.  See if you can cut down from a pack to like a half pack.  Something like that and then you'll eventually get down to none, okay.
PATIENT: My first of the cigarette of the day [REDACTED] bother me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know and it's just getting to the point I need to quit.
DOCTOR: I think that you'll find that you'll save a bunch of money.  You'll feel much better okay and things you don't notice are things that you're body's reacting to.  Your heart will be better.  Your blood vessels will get better once you've quit.  So you want to try to do the patch?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay let's give it a try.  Let me know. Uh I'll be honest you know you give it your best go.  People relapse all the time. Sometimes it doesn’t work or if people do quit they start smoking again.  It's kind of a lifelong thing but I'm sure this guy will stop.  The last thing I'd like to do here is you have a little bit of a cough [REDACTED] short of breath.  I'd like to get some lung studies on you.  Have you ever heard of anything called pulmonary function tests?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you ever done the tests?
PATIENT: Yeah but where they wrap your legs.
DOCTOR: No, no, no it's not that.  That's just uh, I don't think you've done a pulmonary function tests before.  This is where they make you blow into a machine and they test how big your, what your lung volumes are and that kind of stuff.
PATIENT: Oh I've done that before.
DOCTOR: Oh have you?  Well I just, yeah let me take a look here.
PATIENT: Not here.
DOCTOR: Oh, like somewhere else.
PATIENT: They used to do that with us yearly when I worked for a paper company up north.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then they would do it yearly when I worked for the power company down in Madison.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So this was you know like 16 years ago.
DOCTOR: I gotcha.  Let me order that for you, see what they show.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  And we'll see what else, I'll see if I can talk to the social worker for you and maybe set up a meeting.  Okay, let me talk to my attending and I'll be right back with you.
PATIENT: Great.
DOCTOR: What have you got?
PATIENT: No, well kind uh.  [REDACTED].  I have my name on here [REDACTED] you can sign it or not.  This is so that I can drive, so I can get insurance to drive.  Now before they would let me drive, when I was up here last year.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Before they would let me drive again they gave me a test and I passed the test with flying colors.  When I was on the pain medication, now I don't know.
DOCTOR: Why are they making you do this?
PATIENT: Uh I told them that I wasn't working anymore and that I was on disability.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And they said then what kind of medicines are you taking and when I said morphine they said well okay then you got to fill this out.
DOCTOR: Oh really?  [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah so you're not going to know what that means.
PATIENT: Spinal stenosis.
DOCTOR: No [REDACTED] spinal stenosis.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Smokers [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] they're not going to know what that is either.  [REDACTED]. Life long.  Medications morphine oral uh, 15 mgs. COPD, hypertension.  [REDACTED].  Oh you're taking it four times a day.
PATIENT: Four.
DOCTOR: Every four hours.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don't know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] optomistrist [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Oh, good.  I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now, I never asked you how is that mass doing, any pain?
PATIENT: It's a pain.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well it really hasn't gotten any larger.  The largest it was was when it got to a certain size when I came in to see you, I mean right around that area [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] peak.
PATIENT: And it peaked [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
(DOCTOR 27:55  DOCTOR IN:  32:38)
DOCTOR: Okay, I just to kind of to summarize over what we're going to do for you a few things um, I want reorder the C-Scope and I'll have them call you about that.  I'm going to order nicotine patch and you'll get the morphine and you can pick that up too.  Uh again it's once a day for two weeks.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So hopefully you'll be down quite a bit by that time but if you don't take [REDACTED] but if we have a realistic goal of cutting down by our next visit, [REDACTED] every little bit.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh and the last is the pulmonary function tests also they'll call you about [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh I have one more [REDACTED].  That terazosin.
DOCTOR: Terazosin?
PATIENT: Terazosin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: For my bladder, my.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The guy downstairs ordered that for me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah I see that.
PATIENT: And uh it makes me feel groggy so I stopped taking it.
DOCTOR: Okay did it affect your bladder now or how have you done with that?
PATIENT: You know it didn't really make any difference.
DOCTOR: In the first place?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I started on that and they gave me this regimen, it was supposed to last more or less, I don't know two or three week's total.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Whatever.
DOCTOR: Oh they started you in the GU Clinic.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh I went to the first, I through the whole carton; it didn't seem to make that much difference except it made me feel sleepy all the time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay that's fine and why don't you mention that when you see them again.  Cause you're the one saying you're going to see them again.  I want you again colonoscopy, PFTs, get the [REDACTED].  The other thing for you is that I want you to sit outside, I had the social worker contacted and she's going to talk to you about some stuff okay.  I think you should have the surgery and the VA, even though elective, should cover it and you'd have to probably pay some sort of a small co-pay on top of it but in terms of the surgery it's not going to be that expensive for you okay, [REDACTED].  So why don't you talk to her though okay and [REDACTED].  In the meantime, if you're doing much better why don't we see each other in six months okay?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you can get that scheduled up front but first sit here and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Good to see you.
PATIENT: Thanks a lot doc.  You know there's a [REDACTED] that reminds of [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Okay thank you.
PATIENT: 35:21
Time is 9:59.
