DOCTOR: Oh cool. So what's your favorite game?
PATIENT: I am playing Rollercoaster Tycoon.
DOCTOR: Oh cool, that sounds like fun. OK well, hopefully we can get you back to feeling healthy so you can continue to play lots of roller coaster Tycoon. So I’m going to go get the doctor that I'm working with. I'm, uh, I'm wondering, you know, he might want to do a chest X Ray and get a better look at what's going on there. Have you ever had an X Ray before?
PATIENT: I don't think so, no.
DOCTOR: Do you know what an X Ray is?
PATIENT: A little bit, yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's like taking picture of your body on the inside. It's pretty cool so it gives us an idea of what's going on in the inside. Also, this really this part is kind of not so much fun, but I think we should probably do a covid swab because we're doing that with anyone that comes in with these symptoms lately and that's not a lot of fun. We gotta stick something up your nose, but I think that you're really brave and I think that you'll be just fine with it, OK?
PATIENT: OK.
DOCTOR: So we're going to arrange for these things and then I will come back with the doctor that I'm working with and we'll kind of talk about where to go from here.
PATIENT: OK, that sounds good.
DOCTOR: Thank you guys for chatting with me.
PATIENT: Yeah, thank you.
DOCTOR: Thanks.
