DOCTOR: I was wondering if you could start by telling me what brought you into the emergency Department.
PATIENT: So I came to the emergency Department because I've been having pain in my chest.
DOCTOR: OK, where is the pain located?
PATIENT: I would say it's like the whole pretty much the left side of my chest.
DOCTOR: OK, and when did this pain start?
PATIENT: So I think it started just around 2 hours ago. I actually was riding my bicycle and just fell off on, kind of just slipped and I think I fell on that side like when I the impact was right on my chest and since then it's been really painful.
DOCTOR: OK I am how would you describe the pain, sometimes people will use words like burning dull, achy.
PATIENT: I think it's more like someone is just stabbing me and then whole left side area.
DOCTOR: OK, and um. Anything that you've been doing that's that's made the pain worse?
PATIENT: If I. Think I have to take really really slow and shallow breaths. If I try to take a deep breath it just really hurts like taking those small, smaller breaths helps.
DOCTOR: OK, and do you feel the pain anywhere else, or is it just on the left side of your chest?
PATIENT: No, I would say just on the left side.
DOCTOR: OK, and has the pain been getting worse, staying the same or getting better?
PATIENT: I'd say over the last two hours it's been getting worse.
DOCTOR: OK, and do you have any other associated symptoms?
PATIENT: Uh, like I think I I'm having. Also maybe it's just because I'm trying to breathe slowly, but I feel like I can't catch my breath.
