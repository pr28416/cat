DOCTOR: OK. Uhm. OK, I think that that about covers my questions for you right now. Is there anything else that you wanted to add that I didn't ask you about?
PATIENT: Um no, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: OK. I’m going to go over this with the document I'm working with today, I'm guessing just because some of your symptoms are in line with common symptoms of covid 19, that will probably do a covid swab, and what happens with that is since we do have some syptoms, will have to isolate until the result come back and potentially after that if you still have symptoms, even if it is negative. So that's just kind of a heads up on that. Maybe one of the next things that happens. We will probably get you a chest xray 'cause we want to get an idea of what's going on in there. Did you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: OK well thanks for chatting with me we should be back shortly to kind of let you know with the next step.
PATIENT: OK, great, thank you.
DOCTOR: Thanks.
