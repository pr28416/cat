SECOND PERSON A843

PATIENT: Uh.  Yeah.
SECOND PERSON A843
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Now I take this and this.
SECOND PERSON A843
How come your cholesterol pill [REDACTED] this one here but I don't know [REDACTED] more than once, I don't know that one.
PATIENT: No [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A843
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON A843

SECOND PERSON A843

DOCTOR: Which one?
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
SECOND PERSON A843
[REDACTED] me?

SECOND PERSON A843

SECOND PERSON A843
He [REDACTED], he's taken a half and one all he has to do is just cutting one in half.

SECOND PERSON A843

SECOND PERSON A843
I know.
DOCTOR: You have to talk with DOCTOR.
SECOND PERSON A843
I'll talk to him, I'll just go.
PATIENT: Yeah see here this is because it's one tablet and its 400 mg so.
SECOND PERSON A843
Okay.
PATIENT: So cut it in half.
SECOND PERSON A843
Well this is 350, okay.  If you take them, [REDACTED] and if you cut that [REDACTED] that's it.
PATIENT: He wanted it to be [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A843
Okay, that's what I'm saying, [REDACTED] not anymore, then all you have to do is you got to pill in half, you cut one pill in half and take one in the morning and one at night.
DOCTOR: These are the same prescriptions.
PATIENT: Right.
SECOND PERSON A843
That's what I'm saying.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A843
And they're the same.
DOCTOR: Don't worry about that, that's not a big deal because he only gets one, one set of pills at a time and if he has two, three, four prescriptions, it doesn't matter, it's not like he's getting charged more and we only charge you on the pills that they distribute and what that means is that when someone orders a prescription instead of renewing it they just order another prescription for the same thing.
SECOND PERSON A843
Oh.
DOCTOR: It's just listed twice.
SECOND PERSON A843
But do not; he's not getting it twice?  And he's got two bottles at home.
PATIENT: No I don't.
SECOND PERSON A843
You don't?
PATIENT: I have one bottle.
SECOND PERSON A843
You have [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's not a big deal and uh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] cut in half.
SECOND PERSON A843
Okay then.
PATIENT: If it comes to me it is one pill.
SECOND PERSON A843
Yeah I know.
PATIENT: And then I cut it in half.
SECOND PERSON A843
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Take one in the morning and one in the evening.
SECOND PERSON A843
Yeah but I thought you was getting two different bottles, that's what I thought.
DOCTOR: No, no.
SECOND PERSON A843
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, anything else?
PATIENT: That's good enough.
DOCTOR: We talked about shaking, we talked about urination [REDACTED], we are going to check your urine.  I'm gonna draw some blood today um it's been a little while since we've done some of those, the basic blood tests on you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um so we'll just check some other, some basic blood tests to make sure that everything looks okay, cholesterol, electrolytes all of that okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And um your blood levels.
SECOND PERSON A843
Okay and that mean he's not supposed to have eaten anything today right?

SECOND PERSON A843
Did you have something to eat, is that what?
DOCTOR: No, no, you didn't eat anything today?
SECOND PERSON A843

PATIENT: No way.
SECOND PERSON A843
When, when we were coming over here, that was about 10:30, about 10:30.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A843
Might have been 11, it might have been 11.
DOCTOR: We'll be able to draw some lab work.
SECOND PERSON A843
It might have been 12 [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Anything else?  Do you need refills of any of your medicines?
PATIENT: Uh I could probably [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'll refill all of them.
PATIENT: So now what are you saying about the shaking because I’m not shaking today [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A843
Uh uh you didn't take your medicine today either.
PATIENT: No I didn't.
SECOND PERSON A843
Well, that’s probably why you’re not shaking.
DOCTOR: Well the other thing too is you know how are you taking the medicine?  Are you taking it, are you taking it with food?  No, how come?
SECOND PERSON A843
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don’t eat that early.
DOCTOR: It's not eating or not having food in the stomach or taking medicines on an empty stomach, you know now there's some medicines that you're supposed to do that.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But most medicines you want to take with food um but a couple of things, number one is the medicines can upset the stomach or [REDACTED] that you know takes care of that and other people have you know some [REDACTED].  Uh [REDACTED] you know if I had to guess.  How often are you using the albuterol?
PATIENT: Not that often.
DOCTOR: Once a day?
SECOND PERSON A843
Uh uh.
PATIENT: Uh uh.
SECOND PERSON A843
[REDACTED] the medicine.  He'll utilized it [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah, no uh.
SECOND PERSON A843
You use it [REDACTED] a day okay.
DOCTOR: How many times, once, twice a day?
PATIENT: Once a day.
DOCTOR: Okay if I had to guess that it was any of your medicines, it's that cause that is well known.  It makes your heart rate go up, it makes people jittery um I took albuterol and it does that to me um it's just one of those side effects of the albuterol [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well will uh Depakote and [REDACTED] cause I'm taking 1500 mg at night.
DOCTOR: At night.
PATIENT: At night.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  And when are you shaking the most?  Is it all day or in the morning or?
PATIENT: In the morning yeah after uh I get up and when I get up.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And if I have coffee and then I start shaking.
DOCTOR: You got a coffee?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Coffee can do that too.  And you're not eating anything?  Are you eating breakfast every morning?  Uh you know, everything that you've mentioned is [REDACTED] could be causing you know the coffee, not eating, uh the albuterol which if I would guess I would say it'd be the albuterol but I, you know, I don't know when you, it depends on when you take the albuterol and then when you have your shaking, uh you know having taken the medicines on an empty stomach that can also you know cause that.  You're not shaking right now um so it'd probably.
PATIENT: That's because I had no medication and no coffee.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON A843
No you [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A843
They say yes [REDACTED].  I'm telling you when he has his coffee in his hand he shakes so, the coffee done come out of his cup, he be shaking and stuff and I say [REDACTED] what is happening here and he say I think it my medicine I'm taking you know.
PATIENT: And I see the doctor and he told me that [REDACTED] has a side effect of that.
SECOND PERSON A843
Yeah maybe we could tell them that's not helping [REDACTED] maybe we just tell that doctor about [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'm just looking it up now.
SECOND PERSON A843
[REDACTED] shaking [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, that could also be the cause.
PATIENT: Depakote.
DOCTOR: Depakote yeah.  Um what I would do is I would take your medicine when you eat something.  You should be eating [REDACTED], you should have three solid meals a day.
SECOND PERSON A843
Definitely [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON A843
Even if you eat a banana and take your medicine or an orange.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON A843
I bought you some oranges over there every day.
DOCTOR: You should put something in your stomach you know.  The first thing that your stomach seed should not be a bunch of medicines.
PATIENT: Well I, drink orange juice.
