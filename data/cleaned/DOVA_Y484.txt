PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think you should try using them.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you don't have to wait until the cough is gone.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If anything that's probably a good time because the smoking is probably going to make the cough worse.
PATIENT: Yeah but that's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath.  Is there anything new about the cough or is it just [REDACTED]?  Are you coughing up junk?  You got any mucous?
