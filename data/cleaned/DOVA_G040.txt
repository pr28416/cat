DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: I get along, how are you today?
DOCTOR: Good.  You survived everything since the last time I saw you.
PATIENT: Well I have intermittently.
DOCTOR: Well I hope we were able to help you out there with everything that's happened.  Good.  Iâ€™m over this way.
PATIENT: I'm able to lie in bed and breathe more.
DOCTOR: Good.  Okay that's when it was happening at night.  [REDACTED] maybe it's just heartburn but we should get it checked anyway.
PATIENT: Oh my God, [REDACTED] extended an area so [REDACTED] and it works like a champ as I say.
DOCTOR: Good.  How are you with your activities?
PATIENT: Increasing.  Yeah, not earth-shaking now but.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Um, timely enough about a month ago my car broke.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I can't afford to fix it yet.  I'll get it fixed next week, payday comes in next week and uh that doesn't mean I don't have a car.  I just do my running around in the evenings when my daughter's home or on the weekends.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Or I put my two little flat things and I hoof it off because there's a large mall two blocks from our house.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So if I had, I have not gone there, why?  There's no reason, nothing you need over there and uh the evil is every fast food place you could think of in the world is within a half mile of our house so I can go eat something grubby instead of eating good out of the refrigerator.  But uh overall I have some stuff I want to talk to you about today.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh and number one I have, I don't know what it is but if I stretch my out and then pull on something I get sharp burning pains through the upper arm.  I don't know.  At one time I think I was told tendinitis, I don't know if that's what it is.
DOCTOR: How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: It's been bothering me now for about a month.
DOCTOR: And that's when you, like this or like this?
PATIENT: Yeah, when I okay, I can go from straight up, up to there and it starts to get painful.
DOCTOR: And show me exactly where is the pain?
PATIENT: Right in here.
DOCTOR: Right here?
PATIENT: Primarily here but it will run down almost to the elbow.
DOCTOR: And it never goes past the elbow?
PATIENT: No not past the elbow.
DOCTOR: You can extend it down.  Does that hurt?
PATIENT: Uh, hurt no, uncomfortable yes.
DOCTOR: Okay I'm gonna push, resist me okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: How is that, okay?
PATIENT: Downward it doesn't bother it okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That doesn't bother anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay it's not a rotator cuff so that's fine okay.
PATIENT: I'm not a jock; you got to be a jock to have that.
DOCTOR: Yeah you never know.
PATIENT: I don't know, when you get old, I found out today I had cataracts.
DOCTOR: You know everybody gets cataracts eventually.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: Are they going to operate?
PATIENT: Well, he says you have the beginnings.  Everybody tells you inside of the next four years that you need them fixed, tell them to stick it.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: So they're just.  The first time anybody's ever mentioned it.
DOCTOR: Eventually, when you, when they'll probably need to be fixed, you'll probably know it cause things will start looking yellow.
PATIENT: A little fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My wife was an ophthalmic technician.
DOCTOR: Ah.
PATIENT: So when you get into the eyeball side of things we spent many years.  I used to be her prepper and quiz her for questions when she had to take a test.
DOCTOR: I know they ask you @@2@
PATIENT: And so me and the eyeball get together probably better than anything else other than maybe heart and the little bit because of my involvement with that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That was complaint number one.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Number two, it has been brought to my attention that I couldn't hear a board hit me up the side of the head according to my daughter.
DOCTOR: That you're deaf?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: And she said it's not selective hearing is it?
PATIENT: Well I tried to explain that once to her but it worked as well as when my wife explained it, no, no, that's genetic, women get it, men don't.  Oh yes dear.
DOCTOR: Well I heard that usually [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I know and you know how I, you know what are you married?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: You try that on your wife and it doesn't work very well.
DOCTOR: You got blood drawn today, well let me check your hearing here in a second and then we'll review all your labs today too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Which actually look excellent.  Whatever you're doing, you're doing it all right okay.  Um.
PATIENT: What is this my chemical one?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Your cholesterol perfect, its right where you need to be so you're going to significantly reduce and prevent your risk of any further events.
PATIENT: Good.  We have to talk about another subject than that subject too than that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me check the hearing real quick.  Why don't you have a seat up here because I need to look inside.
PATIENT: My father, in the second World War was in the Army artillery.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Boom, boom, boom.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I grew up as a teenager with dad being halfway close to stone deaf.  That meant the TV was turned way up and you had to yell to get his attention.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well then he went to retire in 1959 from the Army after 20 years and then I said well maybe your ears need to have a look and they had come up with an operation where they took all those little pieces matter.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And you of course know, you don't know [REDACTED] stir up etc.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know about that long [REDACTED] but they could push him back together.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well they did that and then they sent the old fart home.  And the first day he's home, I walked and said hey dad how you doing, you shout at me again and I'll break your legs.  Oh shit, does this mean I got to be quiet?
DOCTOR: It worked.
PATIENT: Yeah it worked like a champ but it took a long time.  I had three younger brothers, between the four of us, for us not to come storming in the house yelling.
DOCTOR: Cause you were conditioned.
PATIENT: Oh my God.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You were trained already to try to.
PATIENT: I told my mother well you know we learned okay and she was an RN so.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She understood that but dad didn't.
DOCTOR: You've never been exposed to loud noises have you?
PATIENT: Flying the jet airplanes in the Navy.
DOCTOR: You did okay.  Okay.  Okay.
PATIENT: Up yeah.
DOCTOR: So you've got a risk of this too.  Okay no wax in this one and do you think there's one here that's worse than the other?
PATIENT: If I were pick the right one is probably.  I take a Q-Tip and I don't go shoving it in there.  I'll just to this front level.
DOCTOR: That's perfect.
PATIENT: And take it around and around.  Every once in a while I come with a hunk of wax; sometimes I come out with absolutely nothing.
DOCTOR: There is zero wax in there right now, it looks good.  Never push it any further than where you push it now.
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Those are inside parts, we mustn't mess with any of those.
DOCTOR: Close your eyes for me.  Do you hear noises?
PATIENT: Yes I hear a high-pitched squeal.
DOCTOR: Really?
PATIENT: Oh you're thumping your finger over it but I saw it so that's not fair.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Did you not hear it?
PATIENT: Could not hear it before I opened my eyes no.  Now I can hear your right, your left, I could hear the right.
DOCTOR: But not the left huh.  You can open again.  I might as well finish examining you since you're here and I need to.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: What else is on your mind?
PATIENT: When I first started getting this.  Five years ago I had this stuff and my daughter was gonna see a chiropractor.  Well I have Medicare so I get to go see him.  I get 24 adjustments off him.  [REDACTED].  He didn't, just as bad now.  But he took x-rays as they do all around the spine.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And he showed me the x-ray taken from the side in the abdominal area that had this little white tube in front above the spine.  He says you got calcification in your aorta.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I said okay and he said tell your doctor that.  Consider yourself told.
DOCTOR: Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Uh for a week in 1962.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Now how old are you?
PATIENT: No I'm 67 next month or in February.
DOCTOR: You don't look 67, you look good um.
PATIENT: Living with Italian women.  I'd recommend it highly now.
DOCTOR: Well one thing I was gonna say is that if you were 65 and you had smoked before all the studies show that you qualify for an abdominal ultrasound to look for an aneurysm.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's what we worry about when we hear about calcifications.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I've got a good heart, if it's gonna go pop well that's a different story.
DOCTOR: That's a different, yeah because if it's an aneurysm.
PATIENT: Yeah immediately internally, immediately fatal is what it is.
DOCTOR: So I mean it, technically you don't qualify for that study.  If you wanted one I can order it for you.
PATIENT: I think, well let me ask you this, am I in serious trouble?
DOCTOR: Let me close this door.  Sorry, I just thought.
PATIENT: If this is something that's gonna make me jump off the roof I don't want to know about it.
DOCTOR: I saw people walking out there out of the corner of my eye.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: If it's something, you kind of like we jumped on the stent and everything and knocked that out real quick.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'm due in another six months or thereabouts to see DOCTOR or.
DOCTOR: Yeah DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Again as a cardiologist.  Well to me that's the tube that goes out of the heart.
DOCTOR: That is the aorta uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I would bring it up to him if I'm not putting myself in a hazardous place by not doing anything about it right now.
DOCTOR: I don't think you are.  I think, I have to look this up real quick.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because I know that if you're a smoker, I would immediately counsel doing the screening but you're not.  But you know that you have a history of blocked arteries already.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm almost inclined to just get the test and make sure.
PATIENT: The car comes out of the shop on Wednesday, in theory.
DOCTOR: Okay well they can't do it today anyway.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: What's gonna happen is I think you have to be fasting beforehand so that there's no food content that's blocking the aorta.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, so let's plan on getting that tested.
PATIENT: I will read my mail closely and look for it.
DOCTOR: Very good.  You don't get belly pain or anything like that, okay.  I'll check for a second.  Seldomly, you can actually hear these things with a stethoscope or you can palpate them.  But we'd be in trouble if we're able to do that.
PATIENT: That would be, when the aneurysm is about as big as my fist.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Which means I'm going to lay down very carefully here while you go get someone to bring a gurney in here.
DOCTOR: That's what would happen.
PATIENT: And we'd head downstairs.
DOCTOR: Good.  Deep breaths.  Okay now let's have you lay down flat.  Everything sounds good so far.  Can you pull your shirt up for me PATIENT?  Okay.  And remind me what's this scar from?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Remind me what's this scar from?
PATIENT: Oh I had a quad bypass.
DOCTOR: Okay that's right you had a big, okay so.
PATIENT: It was supposed to be a three-fer but I got this used car salesman kind of pitch while they had it opened, they went ahead and did the fourth one.  It was a Loyola job.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Iâ€™m a stray - I told DOCTOR that and he's like really.
DOCTOR: You know we're all from Loyola actually, although I chose to stay at Hines for the next year completely actually.  I don't really hear or feel anything so I think we're okay.  Kind of a lot of layers to go through though before I get to hear the aorta.
PATIENT: Be nice.  Be nice.  We're working on it.
DOCTOR: You have a garden. Yes.  It's the summer people typically lose weight in the summer.  It's always a challenge in the wintertime to figure out.
PATIENT: I don't think I've put anything on since I came back.
DOCTOR: Well let's see, you look good.  You really do.
PATIENT: But I went out for my hike the other day and I took my 9-year-old and a 10-year-old out because I was house-sitting â€“ kid-sitting, grandson sitting and his buddy and it was a great hike, about a mile by the time we got there and back but we stopped at Pizza Hut while we were out so there went the good of the walk.
DOCTOR: That's what.
PATIENT: But I only had, I had two small slices of pizza.  They ate most of the rest of it.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: So that I ate the next day is lunch.
DOCTOR: You know you can eat that stuff, it's all within reason.
PATIENT: Exactly.
DOCTOR: It's not terrible to eat that once.
PATIENT: When I was next door.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I had this, well this black gentleman from the south.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: He was my roommate.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And I said you know there's a couple of things we got to work on to study because we had this dietician who was like if you drink one glass of whole milk you'll probably die before breakfast and I said yeah I'm one of these guys that believes in moderation and he said well you ought to be from the south and I said guess where my parents live.  They live in Bossier City, Louisiana and he says holy shit but long story short, we invented 95% fat free milk.  We were going to sell that and make a fortune.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Do you know how many little old ladies my mother-in-law would have been alive?  She would have bought that stuff, 95% fat free? You can still but it for the same price as milk.  Cause you know what it is?  Just regular milk.  It's got 5% butterfat in it, that means that it's 95% fat free if my arithmetic's right.  I said we got about ten days to do this and then we gotta get out of the country.  And he told me I was dangerous and apparently made some smart-aleck comment to the nutritionist cause I got a long lecture the next time she came through.
DOCTOR: Oh no.  Well things are looking good okay.
PATIENT: Okay good.
DOCTOR: But I'm inclined to order that test for you.
PATIENT: Alright, letâ€™s do that, when you get that set up can we do something about the hearing?
DOCTOR: And I'm going to order a Audiology consult for that also.
PATIENT: Super.
DOCTOR: So what they do is um they are going to do the, you do all this special hearing tests okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then I suspect though we're probably going to have to get an MRI or a CAT scan of the brain just because whenever there's an asymmetric hearing loss.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: People worry about the worst case scenario which would be a tumor um affecting the nerves there.  Affecting the nerve on that side okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I always tell you about worst case scenarios.
PATIENT: Yeah, I'll throw myself in front of a car on the way home so.  I got nothing to lose.
DOCTOR: I mean.
PATIENT: I'm being facetious, you can see I'm having a good time with this thing today because I have, I feel good.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to see it yeah.
PATIENT: You know if you can't make me feel good because of this, that and whatever else then I worry about it and I'm sitting kind of, I know what it was.  One other thing.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Oh what do they call it?
DOCTOR: Oh and the shoulder also, um that.
PATIENT: That one I got to work on.
DOCTOR: That sounds like muscle and tendinitis.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um I think ibuprofen is good okay.
PATIENT: Uh ibuprofen and Keflex.
DOCTOR: Uh Keflex is an antibiotic.  Do you take it?
PATIENT: Then I'm not talking about Keflex then.  Plavix.
DOCTOR: Plavix.
PATIENT: Plavix yeah.
DOCTOR: There might, okay they worry about increased risks of bleeding, specifically in the GI tract.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you take your ibuprofen with food.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you don't take a lot of it, then it should be okay.  You know another option is Tylenol Arthritis that you can try too.  It's not as good as ibuprofen or Naproxen or meloxicam.
PATIENT: Well the big thing I was concerned was on my way out we were having a little chat about the do's and don'ts of being on Plavix and they said use the Tylenol or acetaminophen instead.
DOCTOR: Have you tried it for the pain for the shoulder?
PATIENT: Uh I got a bottle accidentally of Tylenol P.M.  It was about a week before my daughter said you know P.M. and I said [REDACTED] you get P.M., its PMS you get and she says no look at it and I looked at it and said um I wondered why they were blue and grey pills but I.
DOCTOR: Yeah and that's not the color of Tylenol.
PATIENT: No uh yeah it helped at night sleeping cause that's when I and again when I.
DOCTOR: Lift up.
PATIENT: How do I get [REDACTED] pain in the butt line so I go outside and I open the car door, I get in and then I reach out and have to stretch to get the car door and then pull to pull it closed, oh man so.
DOCTOR: Let's try and you never injured yourself right?
PATIENT: I have not injured my shoulder no.
DOCTOR: All of a sudden this showed up right?  This is all of a sudden right?
PATIENT: Yeah it's just been maybe as I say a month that it came on.
DOCTOR: And you weren't doing something strenuous to bring it on?  I might get an x-ray too.  I don't think it's in the bone.  I'm pretty sure it's in the muscle or the tendon okay.  Um and then physical therapy is another option too, to go over exercises to stretch those muscles out.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I can certainly order that for you, if you don't mind coming in here once the car is fixed.
PATIENT: Well how often do I need to come in here for that?  You see we live 100 mile round trip.
DOCTOR: I know you're over in [REDACTED] right?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Uh let's just take the medicine and see if it helps a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I.
DOCTOR: You want, Tylenol you said helped it right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let's stick with the Tylenol.
PATIENT: I also take 325 mg of aspirin a day.
DOCTOR: That helps too.  That's an NSAID too that should help.  So let's do that.  If it's not getting better and there's an issue then we're going to do physical therapy okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Then, Iâ€™m sure, by that time you're going to be more inclined to do something more aggressive then okay cause it was bothering you more.  Okay and then we need to order a couple other things and then I have to check in with my boss here in the clinic, my attending and I'll be right back okay.  Um but your labs look great.
PATIENT: Magnesium is it in line, is it a little low?
DOCTOR: It is perfect, yours was 1.8, but let me double check that.  Yeah 1.8.  They put you on pills right?
PATIENT: Yeah I take 400 mg a day.
DOCTOR: That should be fine; 1.8 is fine.  If you have like heart arrhythmia, I would probably want you above 2 but I'm quite happy with where it is now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  (Someone comes to the door and the doctor speaks with them)
PATIENT: I have one more question.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: Um probiotics, the little pill full.
DOCTOR: I know about the [REDACTED].  I work with researchers on this one here at Hines actually so [REDACTED].
PATIENT: My wife and my grandson or my daughter and my grandson are taking these things and I said no I can't hurt, I don't think.
DOCTOR: It doesn't hurt usually.
PATIENT: Okay.  Cause it did say there on the back if you're taking any other prescription meds check with your doctor so.
DOCTOR: No it won't hurt and if you're buying these like in yogurt and over-the-counter and stuff like that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately they're usually all the bugs they put in there are usually all dead.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Just to let you know.  There's very few that are actually truly regulating.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And very few that actually truly help and usually people mostly take probiotics for C. diff infection, which you have absolutely nothing to worry about with that.
PATIENT: I'm not going to do it, believe any of that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They're on this diet and I'm the all American diet yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah I don't think it adds anything to your heart either and if anything, honestly I think its expensive yogurt with dead bugs.
PATIENT: But we can wander down to Whole Foods which is in Stromberg and not that far from the house.
DOCTOR: If you want, I think Whole Foodâ€™s really expensive.
PATIENT: No it is but my daughter loves it and I just usually say great, when you go over there you're gonna end up picking up the tab and she'll say yeah let's go.
DOCTOR: Well if she's gonna pay for it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'll be gone just a second okay.
PATIENT: I'm here.  I'm here.
DOCTOR: I'll be five minutes okay.
PATIENT: Sure.
(DOCTOR OUT:  79:35  DOCTOR IN:  85:25)
DOCTOR: Ok let me put in the order and right before you go.  We're gonna do everything like we discussed so okay.  So we'll get you an ultrasound.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You're gonna go to the ear doctor.  We don't need any imaging for this unless it gets bad and then you give me a call.
PATIENT: I'll do that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and then I think that's it right?
PATIENT: Blood sugar.
DOCTOR: The blood sugar was fine, you're not diabetic.  6.3 is the hemoglobin A1c that was checked today and it stayed there.  When it becomes 6.5.
PATIENT: I'm diabetic.  Well I'm going to have to come a little less weight and I got up about a week and a half ago in the night.  I get up at 6 in the morning and I go down and about every other day or every third day I take my blood sugar.  It was 104, where the hell that come from you know.  I had a piece of cake after supper last night, I was at 104 and it's been 104, 105, I get 120 and it went back down to 104 the next day, this last week cause I took every day this week.  But it's floating along at 105 and I know that's chemically induced but um I need to stay on the medication I'm on.
DOCTOR: Right.  But you're just on metformin.  If you were like on insulin we could titrate that stuff down but you're just on metformin.  If you get low blood sugar give me a call.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's like less than 80s and if you get episodes or you're symptomatic.
PATIENT: Metformin is the only drug I have that is for diabetes?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That I just. [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh you're on glipizide too aren't you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay um 104 is pretty good, that's first thing in the morning right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Fasting.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's pretty good.  If you're ever less than 80 give me a call and we're stopping glipizide and youâ€™ll just be on metformin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So actually that's your goal, to come off of the glipizide.  But everything looks good.  If you lose weight this summer, I guarantee we'll stop the glipizide [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I if I take it off then we'll dump this that and whatever else and get Lipitor on, whatever the long chemical name is for generic Lipitor.
DOCTOR: Simvastatin.
PATIENT: The uh, I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: It is simvastatin.
PATIENT: That's what I'm on right now.  Is that.
DOCTOR: I don't remember if that's Lipitor, I only go with generics, I actually don't remember.
PATIENT: Uh DOCTOR said he was looking at Crestor.
DOCTOR: He did mention that.
PATIENT: And then I never heard a word back on that uh you guys don't handle it here but that's alright because you don't handle Plavix here.  You hand blood [REDACTED] or whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Clopidogrel.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Clopidogrel.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Except that it comes in a bottle that says Plavix and when I asked the Walgreens pharmacist he says there is no generic out for Plavix, it came out and it was pulled off the market.  Well you guys apparently decided you're gonna do it so you're giving me Plavix, I said that here, I'll deny it if ever goes out there in a discussion because it's making me work and I like it.
DOCTOR: Yeah but hold on just a second real quick.
PATIENT: Sure.  I'll shut up too.
DOCTOR: Alright these things are sent and we'll see you in a couple months.  We'll check labs again just like today, alright?.  Here you go sir.
PATIENT: Is everything in order?
DOCTOR: Yep, nice to seeing you doing so well.
PATIENT: Great to feel the way I have today although I kind hoped Iâ€™d got rid of the giant pupils.
DOCTOR: Oh you're dilated.
PATIENT: Dilated, yeah.
DOCTOR: Take care okay.
PATIENT: Okay and I just go right over here.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] uh-huh.
PATIENT: 91:28
Time is 3:23.
