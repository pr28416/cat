DOCTOR: Good to see you again.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's been a while.
PATIENT: Yeah it has.
DOCTOR: I think I met you one time right?
PATIENT: Yeah once or twice.
DOCTOR: Back in like September of last year.  How have things been?  I saw you were recently in the hospital for a day or so.
PATIENT: Yeah I was having uh respiratory problems.  I was short of breath and I'd run my medication out and with the heat that we were having at 10 o'clock.
DOCTOR: I think you called August 6th.
PATIENT: I was in on the 7th I think.
DOCTOR: For a refill.
PATIENT: It might have been yeah either the 6th or 7th is when I came in.
DOCTOR: Yeah and no it shows that same day you went into the Emergency Room.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah it was that day.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Next time call earlier.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, that's right.
DOCTOR: Why didn't you call earlier?
PATIENT: I really just lost track of it.  Cause I'd been pretty much surviving on my back-up.
DOCTOR: What's your back-up?  The albuterol or?
PATIENT: That one I've got listed.  Proventil.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah the albuterol.  Um how many times a week have you been using the albuterol?
PATIENT: Um two, maybe three times a week.  Not so much lately now that the weather is cooling off again.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Two or, say it again once or twice a week?
PATIENT: Twice.
DOCTOR: Twice a week.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What's your current asthma medication regimen?
PATIENT: Uh it's, if I saw it I'd know it.  I can't think of it off the.  It's the thing that counts off, does this look like.
DOCTOR: Mometasone okay so you're taking that.  How often are you using that?
PATIENT: Once a day.
DOCTOR: Okay and then what about, are you using any like nasal spray or anything like that?
PATIENT: I got a nasal spray that I use from time to time but it's not, it's not a regular day to day thing.
DOCTOR: Okay and you haven't seen the pulmonary doctors in a while right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Were you using a medicine called, let's see, flunisolide, the nasal spray is flunisolide right and you're using mometasone.  What about someterol?  Were you ever on that medicine?
PATIENT: Not that I can remember.
DOCTOR: And your breathing since you've been discharged in August?
PATIENT: Fine.
DOCTOR: Fine of using albuterol twice a week and your mometasone once a day.
PATIENT: Once a day yeah.
DOCTOR: And um no coughing, shortness of breath or anything?  Good.  What was the trigger?  Like what brought you in?
PATIENT: Well I think it was the humidity and the heat and I cut my own grass and I do stuff around the house so uh.  You know whatever outside allergies there might be but I don't necessarily, I'm not necessarily affected by.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But the combination of the heat.
DOCTOR: Running out of your meds.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Where do you get the albuterol from?  You don't have that listed in our medicine regimen.
PATIENT: No when in remission.  I get it here.
DOCTOR: You get it from here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Mometasone.
PATIENT: That's what I get.  Right.
DOCTOR: And you have enough of these at home?
PATIENT: Uh and I had another one in 2000.
DOCTOR: Make sure that gets on your medicine list.  Um how have other things been going?
PATIENT: Everything's been going, oh I was wondering if I could get a reinstatement on that [REDACTED] that I was getting.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: On a monthly basis.
DOCTOR: So you saw that, I think it's [REDACTED] to some of your testosterone levels, your free testosterone levels came back a little low which could be contributing to your erectile dysfunction.
PATIENT: That could have been it.
DOCTOR: How is your mood and are you like you know.
PATIENT: My mood.
DOCTOR: Your libido, like you're feeling.
PATIENT: Oh I feel good.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That might be a little low too cause I haven't been, you know like I said I haven't had that medication at all and uh, I haven't been as active as I was so.
DOCTOR: Well you know it might be worth treating it then, so we can just put like a [REDACTED] might consider a patch but uh a testosterone patch, that can help replace the testosterone.  It's actually quite common you know in men in their 60s and 70s.  If you have a deficiency but uh, yeah like yours was, your free testosterone was 0.9 and 1.5 is the lower end of normal.  Yours is definitely low.  One thing we could do is repeat it and see where you are today and then consider putting you on that.
PATIENT: Yeah I would repeat it and see where we're at with it after.  It's been a while since I had that vardenafil.
DOCTOR: How many times are you have sexual intercourse?
PATIENT: Uh well more like once a month.
DOCTOR: Once a month?  Okay.
PATIENT: Currently.
DOCTOR: Um okay so the last time you were here we measured your prostate-specific antigen, the PSA.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: A blood test that kind of measures the growth of your prostate um and it can be used for screening for colon cancer or prostate cancer but it has some downfalls um.  We talked about that last time, it giving false positives.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  But then yours has elevated from 06 to 07 it went up kind of quickly but then from September of 07 to January 09 it was more or less the same.  I definitely want to repeat that.
PATIENT: Yeah I think in April is when I had the colonoscopy.
DOCTOR: Yeah you had the colonoscopy in April of 09.  That showed one small polyp.
PATIENT: Yeah they removed that.
DOCTOR: They removed it.  It was a tubular adenoma which is a benign growth but it's actually not entirely benign in the sense that it could, has the potential to develop into a malignancy but that takes many years.  That's why they do a colonoscopy to catch things like this.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: They're recommending getting a repeat colonoscopy in five to seven years.  I prefer to get it in five because you’re young and otherwise healthy.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We want to make sure we don't miss anything.  Um, are you having any like urinary symptoms like a weak stream, dribbling stream?
PATIENT: Sometimes weak.
DOCTOR: Sometimes weak.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How many times a night are you going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Uh generally I'm waking up once a night.
DOCTOR: Once night, not too bad.  What about intermittency where you start and stop when urinating?
PATIENT: Maybe once.
DOCTOR: Once in a while?
PATIENT: Once in a while.
DOCTOR: So we'll get that repeat colonoscopy in 2012.  Looks like you're up-to-date on all your shots.  The flu shot is coming like in a week or so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So make sure you come and get that.
PATIENT: I'll come and get it.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: I had the pneumonia I think a couple years ago, shot.
DOCTOR: Are you able to come back to get some fasting blood work because I want to check.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Your cholesterol, I want to check your prostate antigen, I want to check some screening for diabetes.
PATIENT: Actually I have, I could do it today if you want.
DOCTOR: Are you fasting?
PATIENT: I haven't had anything since 6 or 7 last night.
DOCTOR: Coffee?
PATIENT: Nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay let's do it, let's do it today then.  Um I want to check a few things.  So if that testosterone comes back low I'll find out today or tomorrow, would you consider going on the testosterone patch?  It's a patch you wear on your arm, it has to be removed and changed once a day but you know it might give you energy.  It might give you more libido.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: It might help with erectile dysfunction.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Now remember next time, even if your asthma's under great control, next time you run out of your medicines.
PATIENT: Then just get it.
DOCTOR: Oh you know a week ahead of time call.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And it’s hard to keep track of everyone and I hadn't seen you in a long time.
PATIENT: Yeah so, it'd been quite a while.
DOCTOR: Um which one did you run out of, was it the mometasone or the albuterol?
PATIENT: It was the one that uh, I think it’s mometasone.  The albuterol I had.
DOCTOR: Okay have a seat up hear so I can have a listen to you.  Do you get any chest pain or pressure when you exert yourself?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].  Take some deep breaths in and out.  Appetite's good.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Any change in your weight up or down?
PATIENT: No.  I'm still at 160.
DOCTOR: Swelling in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: No swelling problems, no swelling.
DOCTOR: Sleeping okay?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Bleeding or bruising anywhere?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Moving your bowels?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  Alright let me go talk to DOCTOR or one of the other supervising doctors and I'll be back shortly okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Get some blood work done today.  I want to have you come back, you know things are going okay now but of course if things change we'll see you sooner.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: But maybe six months okay?
PATIENT: That's fine.
DOCTOR: And I'll stay in touch.  I'll give you a phone call about the testosterone and.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The other blood work if it's abnormal.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  42:36  DOCTOR IN:  49:48)
DOCTOR: So everything is the exact same as I talked about.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: With one minor exception, I just read your labs when we checked them.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Your percent free, I'm just telling you why I can figure it but the percent free testosterone for you was low but that doesn't really mean anything cause your total testosterone and your total free testosterone were high.
PATIENT: Oh good.
DOCTOR: So adequate.
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: So we don't need to recheck the testosterone today.
PATIENT: Okay good enough.
DOCTOR: I'll just give you the refills on the medicines.  Um and I'll see you back in six months okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You can go just across the way to get labs done okay.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: And I'll send it up to the Lab.
PATIENT: So now where do I need to go for that?
DOCTOR: Right here.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Thank you.
PATIENT: 50:59.
Time is 10:50 a.m.
