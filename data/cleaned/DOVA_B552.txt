PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And uh everything looked okay.  You had a polyp that wasn’t cancerous.
PATIENT: That wasn't one of my better moments in life.
DOCTOR: Well, it's uh yes [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: But uh the next thing that you just need to have another one in ten years or so.  If you have more polyps than usually they want to repeat the colonoscopies a little more frequently so and then you had any more chest pains?

DOCTOR: Just numbness?
PATIENT: Yeah my arm was going numb.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause you asked me if [REDACTED] arm.

PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Uh do you check it whenever you go anywhere else?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay cause today actually you know it was 133/80 and then on repeat it was 149/98, you know sometimes its a little bit higher when you come to the doctor's office so for right now we can actually just continue with, you know just continue with are you taking the amlodipine?

PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But the last time it looked okay.  Any other things I can help you with today?

DOCTOR: Alright um take a seat okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  38:38  DOCTOR IN:  43:12)
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything looks good.  I think that uh one thing that we could do about your blood pressure right now is have you cut down on the amount of salt.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Do you eat a lot of salt?
PATIENT: No.  I never put it on anything.
DOCTOR: Do you eat a lot of.
PATIENT: But I do eat some beef jerky and stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Okay so a lot of processed foods, in fact about 80% of what we take in in terms of salts comes in from processed foods so it's not really what you add during your meals but if you could just try cutting back on.  Do you eat a lot of you know frozen foods?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: So try cutting back on those things and that'll actually help and that'll bring your blood pressure down a little bit too and then we'll see where it is next time I see you.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And today I'll send up the nurse to give you a tetanus shot, I don't know if she's still around so just give me a second while I find her okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And if not then you can just have that done the next time you come in.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Alright so I don't see her so why don't we just plan on doing that next time.
PATIENT: Fine.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: And you'll need to take this with you and they'll set up an appointment for you.
PATIENT: Okay and okay I was gonna ask about when you want to see me next.
DOCTOR: About six months.
PATIENT: Six months alright.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Does that sound like?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] so.
DOCTOR: Well it'll be in the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then make sure that when you come back you get your labs drawn before.  You'll just stop at the, it's kind of diagonal to here, to get your blood drawn.
PATIENT: Oh okay yeah I know where it's at.
DOCTOR: Yeah and then uh.
