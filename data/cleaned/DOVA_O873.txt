DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And the Pharmacy filled the last refills and every time I would call in the nurse to have them refilled I never got anymore so I didn't know if you discontinued them or you just ran out of refills or what.
DOCTOR: I think it just expired.

DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Because I took one of those health care of my services, you they got the Heart Association come in.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: And they had a van and they did these tests and one was telling me my kidneys are not functioning at the proper level.
DOCTOR: Well the last time you were tested in September.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Not that long ago.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: They were fine.
PATIENT: Okay.  So uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I'm not sure what the issue was with that.
PATIENT: Um cause I just had, I had oral surgery at the VA Hospital.  You know I was telling the nurse [REDACTED] how.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: How bridge broke, that's why I got a flip in my mouth now.
DOCTOR: Where'd you go Jesse Brown or?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah they did it at Jesse Brown but they don't do implants.  See the stitches? They did this last month.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.  Okay.
PATIENT: This is about the second week now I've been out of surgery so I got to go back the end of this month so they can do pictures and then cause I had a bone graft also.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  And they was telling me then my kidneys cause you know they had to prep me for surgery.
DOCTOR: They were telling the kidneys.
PATIENT: And yeah one of the uh, uh anesthesiologists, she looked in the computer after I did my lab work at Jesse Brown, she said your kidneys is just a little bit over the functioning levels, just a little bit over and I said well I'm going to have to talk to my general medicine doctor and see if there's some medicine they got I need to take.
DOCTOR: Well let's see, I'm going to look over at Jesse Brown and see what they're talking about.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you just had a bunch of lab tests today.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, so see I missed my first operation that they scheduled me.  It was back during October or November because my church was doing a rehearsal to do our Christmas concert.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah I remember you telling me that.
PATIENT: Yeah and so I couldn't do the surgery so after the concert in December they had me scheduled and they did it.
DOCTOR: And it's very; I don't think it's a big deal.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: They're telling you, it's very slight.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I think they're kind of making a little bit more out of it than what it actually is.
PATIENT: Oh okay, I was worried.
DOCTOR: You they don't know you know better so.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Don't worry about all that.
PATIENT: So I don't need to worry about this.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I mean as long as we control your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It should be fine.
PATIENT: Okay doctor.
DOCTOR: And it's almost the same as it was when we checked it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Maybe a touch higher but.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: It's not that.
PATIENT: Not some degree, major cause I was under the impression my kidney was getting ready to shut down on me.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no.
PATIENT: And I was going to end up being on dialysis.
DOCTOR: No, no, no.
PATIENT: I'm glad to hear that man.
DOCTOR: No it's not that bad.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I'm having a lot of problem.  My major problem now is my eyes.
DOCTOR: Yeah you don't.
PATIENT: Yeah see right now I have a flap and I missed my appointment yesterday but see the thing is I'm going to a different doctor to treat me for my uveitis in the eye and he's treating me for the glaucoma.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I keep getting flyers.
DOCTOR: Do you see a DOCTOR?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah DOCTOR is the surgeon.  I just started seeing him and he's a surgeon so I know they getting ready to operate and I can't see out.
DOCTOR: Are you doing whatever eye drops they're telling you to use?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah I'm using that but the thing is my pressure still be elevated and then I'm becoming far-sighted.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know, every time I do that, what is that called way front you know where they have you look and then get your eyes adjusted and it be clear.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But it always be blurry and then when I read, I'm farsighted.  Farsighted, I really can't see out of this eye now.  I can't see past 50 feet.  And then now it's beginning to happen with my left eye and my left eye is my good eye so I'm wondering what's going on and then well now, last time I seen the private doctor for my uveitis he had gave me a prescription for bifocal glasses.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then after about two or three appointments here I went back to him and he said all of a sudden I got a lens problem, the bifocal glasses won't help me.  So he had to get me, so I had new reading glasses.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: I said what happened and he say I have a lens problem now and I said well when did that develop and he say glasses won't help me with my farsightedness.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Yeah man it's weird.
DOCTOR: Can you see him today or?
PATIENT: Well I scheduled to see him uh next month.  My appointment is.
DOCTOR: April 15th.
PATIENT: Yeah April, uh-huh cause I called in and rescheduled and I was just so busy cause my wife [REDACTED] when I needed my wife came in, I had to bring her in, uh because she did a biopsy the last time she was here and I had to bring her in last week and they had to go in and get some more of the tissue because they said it may be cancerous.
DOCTOR: What kind of a?
PATIENT: She has and so she had surgery on the fourth floor in the fourth floor, I brought her in the other day and that's when I came down here and made them find out when was my appointment was to see you.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Since I was wondering when my appointment was cause I know I needed to talk to you and my wife was having her surgery to see if they tissue, they had to go back into the side and take a lot of this tissue off to make sure they got it all so she was having cancer in a mole, uh-huh.  So she, then her car went out on her, she had a car went out on her.  The timing broke and then torqued the engine, I never heard of that.  They say Japanese made cars, if you don't change the timing belt in 60,000 miles it'll zap your car and you don't get, you out of the warranty.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I say well man, I said [REDACTED] cars out there cause let them know when they bring in the car in when you get 60,000 miles,
they said no that's their responsibility, they're supposed to read their manual.  I say oh man and she got to spend 4 grand on an engine man, just finished paying on the car.
DOCTOR: Geez.
PATIENT: I tell you man it's always something.
DOCTOR: There's always something.  Are you taking aspirin still?
PATIENT: No I had to discontinue that because when they did the surgery and when I developed a glaucoma.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: What it is the aspirin thins my blood and it ended up raising the pressure in my eye.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they definitely told me I couldn't take it prior to that oral surgery.
DOCTOR: Yeah cause of surgery but otherwise did they tell you you shouldn't take it at all?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah and I been having chest pain.
DOCTOR: Did you get that treadmill test done?
PATIENT: I sure had that test done, I sure did.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I did it at Jesse Brown also.
DOCTOR: Oh you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Did you do it here as well?
PATIENT: I did it here and I did it at Jesse Brown and I talked to the heart doctor up there.
DOCTOR: What did they say?
PATIENT: They wanted me to do the test again but Jesse Brown ended up doing it prior to my cause I had to have the operation and instead of putting me on the treadmill, they induced the heart rate.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: You know how they give you an injection.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And some man there and my heart is racing and they got me hooked up to the EKG machine and then when I got through my eyes was bloodshot red man.
DOCTOR: You're sure you even had this stress test in the last few months here?
PATIENT: Oh yeah it was a little farther back, a little farther back.
DOCTOR: But you saw this DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: In October and he ordered one.  Did you get that one?
PATIENT: He ordered one here but I ended up having it done at Jesse Brown.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay, so you didn't have it done here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You had it at Jesse Brown.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I'll see if we can find that at Jesse Brown.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You said it was fine or?
PATIENT: Uh yeah, yeah because they say it was okay to have surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know.  The only thing I was concerned about is that my eyes turned red and then after I come out of surgery in Recovery the doctors knew my pressure was high, my blood pressure was high and my eyes were red again so I don't know if something has something to do with the [REDACTED] pressure is up or something going on with my eyes again.  You know they noticed that they were bloodshot during that test.
DOCTOR: I never heard about not taking aspirin.  I mean I know for surgery.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But not in general.
PATIENT: Oh they definitely said not to take it prior to surgery.
DOCTOR: I know for surgery but I'm not, I'm saying.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Cause you have heart, you know what I mean you have heart problems.
PATIENT: I got a heart murmur.
DOCTOR: Well yeah you have heart disease.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: In general, you have blockages in your arteries so.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: I don't think, it doesn't make sense to me that you shouldn't be on.
PATIENT: You want me to go back taking them?
DOCTOR: I mean I would.  I'm going to talk it over with my boss and see what [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay if you want me to go back on them I take them.
DOCTOR: But uh it doesn't make sense.  I know for surgery but I don't think for permanently you shouldn't be taking it.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah cause I have a heart murmur.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I have a heart murmur and prior to exercising, walking on the treadmill, I get the chest pains and then all of a sudden once I get into my exercise it goes away yeah.
DOCTOR: And you had that test in October [REDACTED] over there.
PATIENT: Right, at Jesse Brown.
DOCTOR: And you have 66%, you have.  [REDACTED] defect [REDACTED]  They just injected you.
PATIENT: Right, yeah, they did an injection.  To mimic the running on the treadmill.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: They had me lay down, they hooked me up and then all of a sudden they gave me this injection and man my heart was racing man, as if I was on the treadmill or something.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright sir um and you're still getting chest pains quite a bit?

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh, they told me well your testosterone was low and that's what started it but you know, I don't know, if you want.  I know my wife was taking hormones and then her doctors made her take them when she started coming to the VA, made her stop taking them because they were messing with the women,  they were telling the women they were causing cancer.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah they were.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So she couldn't take her.  She was taking Prempro and all that stuff.

I have no energy and I want to stay in the bed all day and I'm glad, the only reason why I made my appointment this morning is cause my wife's car is down I had to take her to her work and her job this morning.

DOCTOR: Yeah we could do that.
PATIENT: Okay then doc that's fine okay.  You know cause I don't want to end up with cancers.
DOCTOR: Right.  No I mean there are definitely risks to it.
PATIENT: Yeah but I know some guys around my age and stuff and older and they go to the health club and they say they got this cream now.  They don't use it cause I know one guy who used to use the patches.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And now he takes the cream cause I ask him I say what happened, you don't use the patch no more, he said no I had my doctor prescribe me the cream and what he say he rubs it on his arm.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: Right.
