PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: What's going on?
PATIENT: A couple breathing [REDACTED] going on.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I only sleep about four hours.
DOCTOR: Are you using your oxygen at night?
PATIENT: Every time I do it doesn't help me [REDACTED] but then they told me to put uh the distilled water, you know what I mean but we've been out of it.  Uh that didn't help either for my mouth and my nose is very dry.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They can’t find out what it is.  It's been about seven, eight, ten years ago.  There was a little lump in here.  They took it out [REDACTED] it was not cancer or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But what is it, blood clot or something, why does it stop me from breathing.  Why can't they find that out?  Is it on my lungs; is there something wrong with my lungs or what?
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Um.
PATIENT: And uh, and another thing and another thing the last time I was here, I went over to the urologist.  [REDACTED] for a CAT scan and never got nothing out of it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh I'd like to take uh [REDACTED] what is it, sometimes I feel like a little pain in here you know, it's coming down from the heart, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I don't know uh so [REDACTED] and find out what it is [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Like do an EKG, the EKG you mean?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Yeah. I want to find out [REDACTED] the blood is circulating okay.  Is the heart working out okay.  I don’t even know.  I told them to find out or get some kind of a test you know when they took the biopsy of the kidney, see if that kidney function or something.  But this time I'm falling apart.  I usually be able to walk and I'm doing exercise.  Now I can't do it, I just can't breathe now.  I'm coughing like crazy.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So what's causing that, what it is then.
DOCTOR: Well okay, so let's focus on one thing at a time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let's talk about the breathing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um now you just saw the pulmonologist.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you're taking your mometasone and Formoterol and your ipratropium.  Are you taking all the three medicines?
PATIENT: Yeah I'm taking those yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: No matter what.

DOCTOR: Dry mouth.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So did the dry mouth get better after stopping it?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  That didn't change anything.
PATIENT: No.  And then they give me uh, what is cause I was breathing, what do they call that pill and they give me uh [REDACTED] almost sent me to the hospital.
DOCTOR: Tiotropium?
PATIENT: No it comes in a little,  you squeeze it and you breathe on it, it's like uh.  Oh God, [REDACTED] and they said it was one of the side effects.  Cause a couple of times it made me sick as a dog.

DOCTOR: Okay so now again.
PATIENT: You gonna put the CAT scan [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah CAT scan, I wrote it down. You need to schedule it, it’s in the computer so I don't know why they were saying [REDACTED] okay.  And they can schedule that for you.

PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Not finasteride.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: But a different medicine for your bladder.
PATIENT: No, they're not giving me any other medicine, what is it?
DOCTOR: They said that you were taking it and then stopped it because you had some side effects.
PATIENT: Maybe that's the one.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I had stopped [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Now my bladder, [REDACTED] another one.  You said [REDACTED] that CAT scan will show my bladder.
DOCTOR: Yeah.

DOCTOR: Why do you need to look? Your gallbladder is over here.
PATIENT: Over here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah and my other doctor said I had, what do you call it uh, ultrasound.

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: When [REDACTED] of the kidney.
DOCTOR: Okay.

DOCTOR: Okay so then just wait until the CT scan.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I remember you telling me about this.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But I don’t think it's really that big of a deal.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: It's not really bothering you that much so we.

PATIENT: No, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now it [REDACTED] specialist for the lungs [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I want to find out.
DOCTOR: Yeah the lung doctor wants to see you in uh let's see, about June, about the same time.
PATIENT: So you'll set up an appointment also huh?
DOCTOR: They didn't set it up already?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Let's see.  If they didn't [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The Spiriva, that was the name of the container.
DOCTOR: Yeah they didn’t put the appointment in but they did want to see you back.

DOCTOR: I uh, let's see [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah that's the Oriental guy.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay uh, I’ll put it in. Let's see Pulmonology.
PATIENT: When the doctors talked to me, [REDACTED] I actually want to find out why I can't, why my breathing is so bad.
DOCTOR: Well I saw his note, what they wrote in the computer.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um let's see if they can see you on the same day so you can do it on the same day as the CAT scan.  [REDACTED] yeah [REDACTED].  Uh so they evaluated you for the breathing okay.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Well one time [REDACTED] try to find out [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And then to say.
DOCTOR: It was not complete.
PATIENT: It was not complete and they had trouble with [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So they said that um.
PATIENT: Because I didn't do nothing.  All I knew is [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah well they said that they could repeat it.  And sometimes that happens with studies, they're just not, you know it doesn't happen properly for whatever reason.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So but uh you were reluctant to repeat the studies so they said that they think that you were having maybe some decrease of oxygen at bedtime.
PATIENT: Yes I do.
DOCTOR: And that's why they wanted you to just keep the oxygen on at nighttime and they said that might help with your sleeping.  Has that happened or?
PATIENT: No it, I didn’t sleep from 9 o'clock, 9 o'clock in the evening till the morning 7 or 8 o'clock, I do have the oxygen.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I do it.
DOCTOR: But you're still not sleeping well?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You're not sleeping well.
PATIENT: No.  I [REDACTED] four hours.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: One day I had one hour of sleep.
DOCTOR: Why are you waking up is it because you have to urinate or?
PATIENT: No I used to, but not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay um.
PATIENT: It's not that I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Are there problems with like falling asleep or [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Well normally I wake up and then like after three or four hours I wake up.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And you know all of a sudden that's it, I'm awake.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.
PATIENT: I try to stay in bed you know so I can sleep some more.
DOCTOR: So do you wake up, uh does anyone sleep around or, do they say you snore?
PATIENT: No, no, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No I don't snore, not that I know.
DOCTOR: No one's every told you you snore.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I don't snore.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The best thing do is the sleeping test, I don't know what else to tell you.
PATIENT: Okay [REDACTED] cause this is a lung problem.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Can they take uh x-ray of my lungs and see what it is?
DOCTOR: Well you can't tell from an x-ray.  They did do an x-ray.  They did an x-ray back about a year ago we did an x-ray and it was normal.  The only thing that you have is the emphysema which we already know.
PATIENT: Emphysema is what, it's in the lungs right?
DOCTOR: It's like a disease from smoking that you get in your lungs.
PATIENT: And [REDACTED] right.
DOCTOR: It means that your lungs are kind of stretched out.  It just happens from smoking.  Cause that's why you take all these inhalers, that's for emphysema.
PATIENT: Oh, that's not clear in other words, what will it get better or stay?
DOCTOR: It doesn't go away once you have it.
PATIENT: Doesn't go away.
DOCTOR: What we do is just treat it.
PATIENT: Treat it.
DOCTOR: With just using the inhalers that's it.  But that shouldn’t cause you from having problems with sleeping.
PATIENT: I understand but it's different.
DOCTOR: So that's a different problem.
PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: So what we need to do.
PATIENT: The other thing I have is I feel sleepy now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So it's for a lack of oxygen I have.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: And that's what causes.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But you know you're using the oxygen and you're not, it's not any better right?
PATIENT: Now you also told me.
DOCTOR: But are you using the oxygen [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes I do.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So then the only other thing is to do the sleep study again and watch, they monitor your oxygen, they monitor your breathing, everything.
PATIENT: And you think I should go back.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it’s a completely safe study there’s nothing [REDACTED]
PATIENT: No I understand that.
DOCTOR: You know, but it's important [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay, okay.  If you want me to I'll do it.
DOCTOR: Well if you, you know you can't sleep so you need to know why and the best way is to come up and do a sleep study so.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: You know it's not like a harmful study you know.  It's just that you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But I think, I don't know if it was overnight.
DOCTOR: Overnight yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah overnight.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: That's what I did the last time on it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They could not get good results.
DOCTOR: There was something wrong with it and so they'll have to do it over.  That happens also unfortunately sometimes the studies, you don't get the information they want.
PATIENT: Now what about, how can they check my heart see if it's about blood circulating.
DOCTOR: Why don't you think you don’t have [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Cause I do get a pain once in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I got to reach in and grab a Bayer aspirin.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I’m afraid that I’m gonna have a heart attack.
DOCTOR: Okay when does this pain come?
PATIENT: Uh when , what time?
DOCTOR: Like what are you doing?  Are you just sitting there or?
PATIENT: Oh once.
DOCTOR: Walking or?
PATIENT: No not when I'm walking.  It's when I'm sitting sometimes then you know when I watch TV.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh yeah.
PATIENT: Or uh.
DOCTOR: So just sitting.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you feel short of breath when you get this pain?
PATIENT: Oh yes, yeah.
DOCTOR: But you get the pain then you feel like you can't breathe?
PATIENT: Right.  [REDACTED] can't breathe [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Short of breath. Do you feel sweaty and your jaw hurts?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: If you want to do an EKG we can do an EKG and we'll know in a second, look at it you know and see.
PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: If there's anything abnormal.
PATIENT: If it is will it show on it or can they do it here or [REDACTED] do I set it up?
DOCTOR: Oh your angiogram.
PATIENT: Angiogram.
DOCTOR: Well they aren't get an angiogram just for once in a while chest pain.
PATIENT: I understand that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: When do they do an angiogram to find out?
DOCTOR: If they do an angiogram, we check your heart if you having chest pain or if you do a stress test and it comes back abnormal they might do an angiogram.  If you're having really bad chest pain and it's very likely you're having a heart attack.  But if it's just once in a while when you're sitting watching TV that's not necessarily that worrisome.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um but if you have chest pain very often or say you're walking and you have chest pain and you rest and it goes away, that’s a scarier type of chest pain.
PATIENT: So that's.
DOCTOR: Then we're going to do an angiogram for that so.
PATIENT: What do you recommend?  Is there one that [REDACTED] clean out the arteries what is it just one artery?
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: How ca I figure out what artery it is.
DOCTOR: You have to do a stress test and look inside or you can look inside.  They aren't going to just do an angiogram unless there's some really concerning findings.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and like I said you have to have really bad chest pain or you have to have an abnormal stress test.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: If you really want a stress test, you can get a stress test and we can see if you know [REDACTED] something is going on with your heart.
PATIENT: I don't know if the stress test [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: If you feel tired you know when you're walking and things like that.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.
DOCTOR: Anything like that.
PATIENT: If I'm walking yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so an EKG and we can get a stress test if you want.  Have you ever had a stress test before?
PATIENT: Uh stress test, not here.  I had a stress test.
DOCTOR: Long time ago?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: A couple of times.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Like before, when I had, with my other doctor and I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] Blue Cross Blue Shield.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I had it at St. Luke's over here [REDACTED] hospital you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Can you walk on the treadmill?  Probably not, do you get too tired?
PATIENT: I don't, I get tired when I'm walking you know from the parking lot.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: To the, like maybe 100 feet or something.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now a treadmill, I might, I don't know how many steps or whatever you know but the people over there.  The last time there were four or five different specialists over there.  You know what I mean they're waiting for the, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: If anything happens then they bring you back to normal or uh.
DOCTOR: Okay so I just ordered a stress test for you.
PATIENT: But before we do anything else, they'll probably do, [REDACTED] run out of it right?
DOCTOR: What?
PATIENT: To clean out the artery.
DOCTOR: They're not going to do an angiogram.
PATIENT: No I understand that.
DOCTOR: They're gonna do a stress test first to see if everything's normal.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what I'm saying.
DOCTOR: Cause you don't want an angiogram unless you to have it.  It's not a risk free procedure.  That's a lot more dangerous than the sleep study.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Because what they do is they put die, they shoot it into your body.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then they track it all the way inside your body into your heart.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So there are some risks.  There's risks of dye allergies, renal failure um you know problems with your vein in your leg [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well I'm not saying that I want it, in regards, I understand [REDACTED].  That's why I'm asking all these things [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah so we'll give you a stress test okay and then we'll see.
PATIENT: And then we'll find out what's causing all this.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: So which one [REDACTED] do I see first, the [REDACTED] the sleeping study.
DOCTOR: Well the sleep study um.
PATIENT: Which one I would see first?
DOCTOR: Okay so we want to do the sleep study.
PATIENT: Before everything else?
DOCTOR: Whatever order they come in [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay [REDACTED].  Is this the test, for about six months [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I uh.
PATIENT: They did something on me and you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: I think you need to talk to the, hold on you need to repeat the sleep study [REDACTED].  So you said you don't snore [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: I mean you have disturbed sleep, you have unrefreshed sleep, you have difficulty maintaining sleep.  Are you sleepy in the daytime all the time?
PATIENT: No but I do nap at noon, you know when I go home I feel like, sleepy but I can’t sleep.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, okay.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: And you don't have diabetes and you don't have high blood pressure.
PATIENT: No. Diabetes, I take, my sugar.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they say that its good but sometimes I have to have like something sweet when I get a low sugar or high or.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Okay.  So they're gonna schedule the sleep study for you, the [REDACTED] stress test.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
