DOCTOR: PATIENT?  Hi, how you doing?
PATIENT: Uh tired.
DOCTOR: Tired, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah no I'm not sleeping good these days.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What's wrong with the sleeping?
PATIENT: I wish I had an answer for you.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh some of it I can anticipate.  Literally, I'm waking up in the middle of the night with pain laying on my side, roll over the pain goes away but uh that doesn't happen all the time, just rather infrequent and I just can't sleep.  Last night I got about four hours sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you sleeping at all during the day?
PATIENT: Occasionally I'll take a nap but that's occasional.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um how much coffee do you drink?
PATIENT: Uh let's see maybe a cup or two in the morning.  I make sure I don't drink anything late at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I even stopped drinking iced tea to uh you know do it early in the day.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What time do you try to go to sleep?
PATIENT: Generally about 9:30 after the news.  Last night it was at 11 o'clock cause I was watching the Cubs game.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um so number one, your sleep hygiene is pretty decent um.
PATIENT: What do you mean? My sleep hygiene, I'm sorry?
DOCTOR: So uh sleep hygiene is taking no naps during the day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And um limiting caffeine intake.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So um those are two things that you can do to help yourself sleep better.
PATIENT: Obviously I'm doing that but it's not working.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um so I can give you medications to help you fall asleep at night um but one the medications can make you feel a little drowsy when you wake up.
PATIENT: I'll hold off on that just so you're aware that I'm having problems but uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um, all I can say is try to uh, limit even more so maybe your caffeine intake in the morning.
PATIENT: Hmm, two cups?
DOCTOR: And I know.  I, if somebody told me to stop drinking coffee I'd probably say no but if somebody said okay now put yourself in the shoes of not being able to sleep at all.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Then I'd consider it then.  Um and then no naps during the day.  Um, obviously no caffeine at night um and then trying to eliminate any sort of distractions like closing the windows or.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um shutting any doors.
PATIENT: Sounds, drown out sounds right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Uh I can give you medication to help you get to sleep um.  What I tend to do with medications that are sleep aids, is any sleep aid is a possibility of becoming addictive, meaning if you take it long enough, eventually you need that to get to sleep.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you can't sleep without it.
PATIENT: Therefore I will say no at this point.
DOCTOR: But what I tell my patients who have problems sleeping is and I give them sleep medication is the medication is not for every night.  The medication is for one or two nights a week in which you say oh my God I didn't sleep last night and I didn't sleep well the night before and I got a big test due tomorrow and or I got a big thing to do at work and I have to get some sleep tonight.  I cannot deal with you know staying awake all night.
PATIENT: I don't want to take any of it right now period.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's fine.  Um how about, what else is going on?
PATIENT: Well I'm curious to know what was the results of the two tests that I had, the CAT scan or whatever else that I had.  Haven't heard anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um so you had an ultrasound of your thyroid.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It was normal.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: It still sees that you have some nodules on your thyroid.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And that your thyroid is a little bit enlarged but it's not any different from the last time they checked it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It's about a millimeter bigger.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um.  There's a CT scan.  You have some evidence maybe of some sinusitis.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Which is inflammation in your sinuses.  Did you have surgery on your sinuses before?
PATIENT: Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  They mentioned that you had the results with some surgery.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, many years ago.
DOCTOR: Uh.  You have a polyp in your sinuses.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um, the polyp is uh can possibly cause some uh sinus congestion and if you wanted to I can refer you to the ENT surgeons and they can look at possibly removing that.
PATIENT: At the moment it's probably a lot better than it has been in years.  The congestion that I've had literally, I've was in here twice in the Emergency Room and uh that has almost completely cleared up.  the only time I have a problem is when I'm first waking up in the morning and one of the nostrils will be uh basically clogged and it's you know.
DOCTOR: Are you uh using the spray?
PATIENT: The spray, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay good.
PATIENT: It's working.
DOCTOR: And how about the pills?
PATIENT: Which pills are you referring to.  I got so many of them.
DOCTOR: The loratadine, it's basically Claritin.
PATIENT: I believe so. I literally…I got a list; let me see, which did you say it was?
DOCTOR: Loratadine.  Lorat
PATIENT: Lor, okay, take one tab oh yeah okay.  It comes wrapped in a silver foil yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] yeah.
DOCTOR: Then great, then they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing.
PATIENT: They were yes okay.
DOCTOR: I'm glad you took them regularly.  Some people take them for three, four days and then they say this doesn't work at all and they throw it away or they take them for like whenever they have a problem and it doesn't really fix the problem.  It's a medicine that's meant to be taken every day or every day during the season.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: In which you have problems with nasal congestion or something like that.
PATIENT: I should mention that I had uh two infected toes after I clipped my nails, soaked them in Epsom salt and groin salve and it cleared it up so.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: I'm trying to understand what's going on with my thyroid.  Uh a week or so ago we were going out to eat so I took my blood sugar before we went out.  It was at 186.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh I went to the restaurant, ate, figured it was going to shoot way up, came back uh it was down to 111.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Took my evening medication, it went back, so it was about an hour and a half between the first and second reading, about an hour after, for the third reading and it was up to 116 after I'd taken the medication.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So it didn't seem to make sense that it would be 186 and then drop down to 111 without medication then go back up to 116 with the medication.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't understand that.
DOCTOR: Uh I don't have an explanation for it either.  That's not usually the way the medications work.
PATIENT: That.
DOCTOR: I don't know if maybe it took a while for the medication to.
PATIENT: You know what I'm saying is I hadn't had the medication since that morning and I go out in the evening to eat and it's 186.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I had a fairly regular day so I didn't see any reason why I should and I still don't understand why it went down to 111 without medication.  I am really concerned about just how accurate or what is going on.
DOCTOR: Well the meters can be inaccurate uh.
PATIENT: That I can believe yeah.
DOCTOR: But if you get an inaccurate number you can always recheck it again and see if you get the same number um.  Usually if you recheck it and you get the same number, the machine is fairly accurate if you repeat the value.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And if it's the same it's.
PATIENT: So what you're saying you really can't be, you don't have enough information to be able to say.
DOCTOR: Exactly.  If you were in the hospital and this sort of thing happened you know, I would have a more controlled environment.  I'd be able to know exactly what you ate; I'd be able to know
when you got your medication and.
PATIENT: I'm going to cut you off there.  When I was in here in the Emergency Room I was in here for three days.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: One time they came in did a blood test and the technician who did the blood test, ah you've been cheating and I hadn't basically been out of the room.  I hadn't had anything but what had been served to me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So literally I'm saying something doesn't seem right.
DOCTOR: You mean cause your blood sugar was high?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I don't know if it was because uh the carbs and that were more than what you should've gotten or what.
PATIENT: It doesn't make sense but you know I am concerned about it.  You know literally that it's just that inconsistent and I know I basically have been.  When I cheat I cheat okay, but I can account for it but there was nothing in this case, either of these cases.
DOCTOR: All I can tell you is that as long as your blood sugars aren't dropping to low levels where you're below 70s uh or they're not.
PATIENT: Once I think.
DOCTOR: They're not regularly really high like regularly above 200, I'm happy with things being in the middle.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: And uh I would adjust medications based upon your hemoglobin A1c, which is the number I measure in the clinic.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That we measure which is a long term measure of your blood sugars and your sugars over 3-4 months, kind of what it averages and so that's a number that we like below 7.  We have good data that shows that if we keep people below 7 they have better outcomes.
PATIENT: Hmm.  Actually I was surprised I wasn't asked to come in for a blood test this time around but uh.
DOCTOR: Oh let's see when your last cholesterol panel was.  I was looking at your thyroid hormone study.
PATIENT: How long ago was that, I'm trying to remember?
DOCTOR: The thyroid study was done on the 21st of April.  So it shows basically that, your numbers show that you might have a little bit too much thyroid medication, very, very little too much.
PATIENT: Okay.  If it's too much that could also relate to why I'm having trouble sleeping.
DOCTOR: Uh that's possible but it's only very slightly elevated.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: To the point that I might consider not even doing anything about it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh but let me look and see what the Endocrine doctor said.  Now I see normal is 0.76-1.46, you're 1.59.  It's just barely above the upper limit of normal.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: You take two thyroid pills every day right?
PATIENT: That is correct.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And the endocrinologist said they wanted to see you back.
PATIENT: Hmm, I haven't heard anything so.
DOCTOR: I think you have an appointment coming up.  Your hemoglobin A1c was better last time.
PATIENT: What does that mean was good?
DOCTOR: So 6.9 um, our goal for this is less than 7.  This is a measure of your long term sugars over the last three months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The way it works is called glycosylated hemoglobin or hemoglobin A1c.  Hemoglobin is uh a compound that's inside of all of your red blood cells; it's what stores the oxygen in your blood.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: So the higher your sugars are in your blood, cause sugar sticks to those hemoglobin molecules.
PATIENT: So basically we're on track is what you're saying.
DOCTOR: So we measure the amount of sugar that's stuck to those and that gives me an average of your sugars for the last three or four months.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So uh 6.9 is below the guidelines of 7 so you're between 6.5 and 7 is the goal.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Looks good.  So no change in those medications and blood pressure looks good.  I think we'll just uh keep everything there as it is.  Uh, did you start taking fish oil tablets?
PATIENT: Yes I have been.
DOCTOR: Oh good.
PATIENT: Twice a day.
DOCTOR: Good and you've had a colonoscopy before right?
PATIENT: Uh that's no surgery no.  Oh the colonoscopy that's the rectum.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Yes, that's colon what am I thinking.  I've had it at least twice here.
DOCTOR: Yeah I was just looking at that.  Um.
PATIENT: I shouldn't need another one for a couple of years, for years maybe.
DOCTOR: Yeah you don't need another one for another six years.
PATIENT: Ah good.
DOCTOR: And I think everything looks good and I think, oh I was thinking you know what.  Another thing I want to my boss about seeing whether or not we should go down on that dose of uh Synthroid.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Cause you've been having trouble sleeping and your numbers are a little bit high.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I think that that would be a good thing to do.
PATIENT: Two things I have to mention, literally, on a scale of 1-10 I'm getting pains of about 1 level okay.  Uh I had gallbladder surgery, every once in a while, within a few hours after eating, I can feel pain in that same area.  It doesn't make sense.
DOCTOR: Which area?
PATIENT: Right about here is where I had the pain when I had the gallbladder okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh the other one, this goes back 40 years, uh when I was in Vietnam I had my morning bowel movement and I happened to notice a lump in my left cheek.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Went into the clinic, they looked at it, come back after where I'm taking care of everybody and the operated right there, the local anesthetic pulled out a lump that was probably about that size and I remember a big mass.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I don't know, that was the end of that you know I got shipped home shortly thereafter so the paperwork probably got lost on the thing but literally it was just a slit, pull it apartpart and excised.
DOCTOR: You probably had a lipoma.
PATIENT: Yeah probably but anyway that area is starting to feel sore again every once in a while and I can't figure, it doesn't make.
DOCTOR: Are there any lumps back there?
PATIENT: Uh I haven't been able to feel any lumps back there.
DOCTOR: Do you want me to check to see if I can feel any lumps back there?
PATIENT: Uh I would appreciate it yeah, you know.
DOCTOR: Um and then as far as the pain goes here, are you having any diarrhea at all?
PATIENT: My uh bowel movements are erratic.
DOCTOR: That's right I remember now.
PATIENT: The same thing you know literally hard to very loose and I basically cannot predict.  If I drink too much milk or diet I know it's going to be loose okay.  If I drink too much alcohol or even sometimes just a little bit of alcohol, it hardens up.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I can predict the cause of that anyway.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Control for it.
DOCTOR: Uh so the reason I ask is pain down on this side I think of two main things, one would be um hard stools and the other would be diverticulosis.  Diverticulosis is where your colon instead of being a nice even tube.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: For the stool, you get these little out pouching on the side of it, almost like a pocket for your pain.
PATIENT: I vaguely remember when I had the colonoscopy somebody made a, one of the technicians or whatever was doing it, a doctor I don't know, um made a remark about that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let's just take a look at it.
PATIENT: I’m surprised I remember I'm supposed to be knocked out in there, it didn't knock me out so I was hearing a lot of things that maybe I shouldn't have.
DOCTOR: Yes diverticulosis.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So sometimes those can get irritated or inflamed.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh and usually that stuff is self-limiting, it goes away.  If you start to feel really sick, like nauseous, sick to your stomach, having fevers, that would be a symptom that one of those have gotten infected and so you need to come in to the hospital, but I think a little bit of pain down in that area, I wouldn't do anything about it at this point.  You might just have a little bit of a low grade infection.
PATIENT: Yeah you know basically the reason I had the gallbladder out, I think it was the gallbladder yeah, it was the West Side VA Hospital.  Anyway I had been to; I hadn't been in there since the White Castle.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And so this very greasy food.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And within 24 hours I had somebody drive me to the Emergency Room.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So and basically it's the same area of feeling the pain but definitely not as intense.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So.  Anyhow, you want to look at the . . . and see.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I'll take a look at it.
PATIENT: Okay.  Pull them down I guess right?
DOCTOR: Is it about here?
PATIENT: Yeah right where you had your thumb a second ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: As I recall it was more, yeah got something there.
DOCTOR: Hold on.  Probably just one of your muscles back there.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I don't feel any tumors.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So.  So uh lipomas are a benign tumor.  It's basically just fat cells in your body.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That proliferate too much, they multiply too much.
PATIENT: That's one of two that I've had.  Another time I had another one, about two inches below my.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Right on the spinal cord.
DOCTOR: Oh wow.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Those are the problems with those is you get, they're benign but if they come into a spot that's.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: A delicate area.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Then removing it can become difficult.
PATIENT: Fortunately the girl I was dating at the time felt it and called it to my attention.  So you want me to wait while you check with your supervisor.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The only thing I think we're going to talk about with him is possibly going down on that Synthroid dose.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then the endocrine doctor wanted to see you back um and they also wanted to see you back with a repeat ultrasound of your neck so what they wanted to do is give you more of the Synthroid medication and see if there are some nodules in the thyroid, see if they disappear.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Will they notify me or what, I was going to ask you.
DOCTOR: So what I'll do is I'll put in a request and they'll call you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: About uh setting up the Endocrine appointment.
PATIENT: Alrighty.
DOCTOR: Okay and I'll, I'll talk to my boss to see whether we want to repeat the ultrasound now or.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Wait [REDACTED].
(DOCTOR OUT:  162:4  DOCTOR IN:  168.18)
DOCTOR: Okie doke.
PATIENT: Okay what happens?
DOCTOR: So he wants me to refer you or have you see DOCTOR um and then repeat your thyroid studies today and then based because those were…
PATIENT: Oh go downstairs to the yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Lab, yeah get a blood draw.  Um and repeat those studies today and if they're still elevated.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Or even if they're more elevated then I'll give you a call at home.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Reduce that dose.
PATIENT: Okay and I just happened to notice that this being up for a renewal, I only have one more refill between now and August.
DOCTOR: I'll go ahead; I go through all my patients' medications.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: When I write your note and I'll make sure all your refills are up-to-date.
PATIENT: So by the time I get downstairs to the Lab they will have the work order for me or whatever is required?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, I'm putting it in right now.  When should I see you back six months?
PATIENT: Sounds good to me.  Unless something transpires between now and then regarding the.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay take that out there?
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: Thank you very much, see you in six months.
DOCTOR: See you in six months; try to stay out of trouble.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] at my age?  Take care.
DOCTOR: And I put on the bottom there, I wrote on the bottom of that sheet that they should just set you up with DOCTOR.  I shouldn't have to put anything in the computer for it because you've already seen her, that it's just a follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: They should be able to schedule you with that okay, but should you have a problem just come back over here.
PATIENT: Okay.
PATIENT: 171:30
