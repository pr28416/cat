DOCTOR: PATIENT.  How are you?

PATIENT: To the left or the right?
DOCTOR: To the right, all the way back to the right.
PATIENT: Okay.  [REDACTED] turn right.
DOCTOR: Take your time, take your time.
PATIENT: To the right and to the left.
DOCTOR: So you guys have had a lot of things to do since the last time I saw you.
PATIENT: Ah yes.
DOCTOR: Yes and it looks like you've done a lot of them.
PATIENT: I've done everything.
SECOND PERSON M903
[REDACTED] he did five in the last month.
PATIENT: Except the MRI that you cancelled.
DOCTOR: Huh?
PATIENT: The MRI that you cancelled.
DOCTOR: When did you do the CT?
PATIENT: I did the CT already.
DOCTOR: I think they can't send you for an MRI because your, you have the what do you call the hardware in your neck right.
PATIENT: Right.
SECOND PERSON M903
Oh.
DOCTOR: I don't think you can go because of that.  Or do you have a pacemaker PATIENT?
PATIENT: No I don't.
DOCTOR: You don't hmm.  For some reason we had to cancel that MRI because yeah it was contraindicated for a reason that I can't quite recall but.
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON M903
[REDACTED] tests [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh we did.  I think we've come upon something now.
SECOND PERSON M903
Oh.
DOCTOR: When we visited the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation doctor because of the problems with the stride and the walking, do you guys remember what he told you?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: What did he tell you was going on?
PATIENT: He scheduled me for something else.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: For my eyes as a matter of fact.
DOCTOR: He did.
PATIENT: And a swallow test.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: And uh I think that was it.
SECOND PERSON M903
So what'd you find out?
DOCTOR: So what he thinks is going on is um you might have a syndrome that's very, very similar to Parkinson's disease.  So not maybe Parkinson's disease specifically, but so there are a whole range of things that are very similar.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And there were things that he saw when he evaluated you so when you write you write really small.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: On the micrographia and when you move you tend to move very slowly, that's what we call bradykinesia and you know the way that he watched you walk, all of these and then that combined with the falls.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And the difficulty maintaining your blood pressure when you're moving a whole lot.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: He thinks that's what's going on.  So now it's a matter of what are we gonna do next.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: There are medications available for this.
PATIENT: (Patient makes a noise.)
DOCTOR: Which I know you're not excited about medication.
PATIENT: I am so sick of taking medications.
SECOND PERSON M903
His legs is paining him now too.  Tell her.
PATIENT: Right.  I've been walking too much.
SECOND PERSON M903
He only walks [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Today I have.
SECOND PERSON M903
PATIENT, he waited in the car, came here and walked from the parking lot.
PATIENT: That take effort.
SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah and his nose is bleeding.
PATIENT: Yeah my nose has been bleeding all morning.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Are you taking any medications that thin your blood?
PATIENT: I don't think so.
SECOND PERSON M903
[REDACTED] up in his nose.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON M903
And it's irritating so he [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Then that's exactly why it's bleeding.  You kind of just need to leave it alone.
PATIENT: It just started this morning though.
SECOND PERSON M903
You know with that scab [REDACTED] he probably shouldn't do that you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  We're just gonna have to keep the inside of your nose very well moisturized.
SECOND PERSON M903
That's why I told him to put some Vaseline up in there but.
DOCTOR: You could use Vaseline.
SECOND PERSON M903
[REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: And you can use a saline spray.
SECOND PERSON M903
You know this is something new.  He fell twice yesterday.
PATIENT: Did I?
SECOND PERSON M903
Yes you did.  When we came out of church.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Are you using, I don't see that you're using your cane today.
PATIENT: I forgot it this morning.
SECOND PERSON M903
He has been, he has been.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I don't think that's gonna be optional anymore PATIENT.
PATIENT: I understand but I just forgot it cause I was rushing to get here because we woke up late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely.
SECOND PERSON M903
It was not a good night [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I woke you up at 10 to 8 didn't I?
SECOND PERSON M903
No.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I think.
PATIENT: Now what'd they see in the x-rays?
DOCTOR: Um I don't think anything has changed too much on the imaging.  Um in terms of your neck.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Are you still having the neck pain?
PATIENT: Yes.
SECOND PERSON M903
Wasn't that you who called and said that ya'll seen that one [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So uh a little bit of a change but nothing major so I don't think.
SECOND PERSON M903
But it still bothers him.
PATIENT: It feel like its damn heavy behind my ear now.
SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Is it pain?
PATIENT: That where it feel like the plate is.
DOCTOR: The plate is?  So we definitely do not see that at all because that would have been an abnormality.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And we would've have uh called you in and um so they didn't find any evidence of a fracture or subluxation which means like they didn't find any where the two parts of the vertebrae sort of aren't aligned anymore.  Um.
SECOND PERSON M903
But when he be getting up, like if he get up out the chair like this.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I fall back.
SECOND PERSON M903
And falls back I told him he be getting up too fast but sometimes he really don't get up that fast.
DOCTOR: That is due to what we think is the Parkinson's disease.
SECOND PERSON M903
Oh.
DOCTOR: All of that is tied together so the falls, the problems with the gait, you know we're gonna say all of that and the blood pressure issues, all of that is tied together.
SECOND PERSON M903
Oh.
DOCTOR: So I think we're gonna have to go seeing a neurologist cause they're the ones who really manage this okay and they'll be able to start you on some medications.  So I already put in for the consult but it doesn't look like they've responded to it so I'll put in for it again and I'll call them today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So they can get in touch with you and you can get in to see them.
SECOND PERSON M903
And you call the number to go get the driver's test?
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: Probably Hines VA.
DOCTOR: Yep.
SECOND PERSON M903
I told him, you know what I'm saying.
DOCTOR: It's not that I don't want you to drive.
SECOND PERSON M903
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's not safe.
SECOND PERSON M903
I know it's not cause I've been riding with him.
PATIENT: (Laughs)
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON M903
I know.
DOCTOR: So we've got to look at.
SECOND PERSON M903
I'm going to insist that he's not going to drive.
DOCTOR: Good, good, good. Um so those are the big things for us right now.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON M903
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: I [REDACTED] garbage.
DOCTOR: And then did you get that reacher?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay and have you been using that at home?
SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I think I used it once.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON M903
He been reaching to get that, I told him to put it closer.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON M903
So he been using it.  He does use his cane [REDACTED] the day.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh we're [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh okay, that's okay.  So [REDACTED] Um when you're having those kind of nosebleeds you have to be very gentle with your nose.  You can't keep blowing it.  All you want to do, I know it's irritating, is hold out, [REDACTED].  Hold the tissue up to your nose and try not to blow, just hold it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then right here on the bridge of your nose hold down.
SECOND PERSON M903
Now see that has started happening like this.
PATIENT: This morning.
SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah this just started happening, it hasn't been like that.
DOCTOR: Just hold it.
SECOND PERSON M903
But [REDACTED] I saw [REDACTED] it get all [REDACTED] I can tell when he needs to blow his nose [REDACTED] but then he [REDACTED] blow it [REDACTED] you know not blood, mucous you know come out.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Don't blow okay.  You just want to hold pressure here to prevent it from bleeding and help it clot.  I know it's irritating in here and you want to blow it out but you're not gonna be able to because there's a scab in it.
PATIENT: I have to breathe.
SECOND PERSON M903
Oh he definitely had a scab.
DOCTOR: You can breathe through your mouth.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Breathe through your mouth okay.
PATIENT: Hmm.
SECOND PERSON M903
But he always be picking at it you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah don't pick it.
SECOND PERSON M903
Don't do that, cause I looked up there.
DOCTOR: You're not giving it a chance to heal.
SECOND PERSON M903
I was just seeing that he was blowing and I told him not to pick it, just leave it.  I was gonna put some Vaseline in it.
DOCTOR: Vaseline and we'll get you some saline spray today.
SECOND PERSON M903
And I bring him here doctor.
PATIENT: Wow.  Yes ma'am.
SECOND PERSON M903
Listen to her.
PATIENT: Yes ma'am.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  So that's kind of where we are with that so I think the big key, you know, how much the medications are gonna be able to help is really unclear.  It just depends on how you respond to them.  So I think the big key is it's gonna be some changing lifestyle stuff so using your cane, using the reacher.  Try not to get into situations where you're bending over a lot or coming back up.
SECOND PERSON M903
Right.
DOCTOR: No sudden motions.  You want to do everything gingerly.
SECOND PERSON M903
Slow.
DOCTOR: Because the issue is your body is having a hard time regulating.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure so when I move up and down like this my body's able to maintain my blood pressure so I don't feel woozy when I come back up and this way I don't fall backwards.  Well one of the things that you find with this disease is that your body has a hard time doing that it's what we call postural hypotension.  So depending on what, you know, position you're in and if you're moving from one position to another it's having a hard time maintaining um blood pressure all over your body and so that's when you can easily fall.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Okay right, cause there was one fall when you were like this, you came back up and then.
SECOND PERSON M903
He go back.
DOCTOR: And then you'd go this way right?
SECOND PERSON M903
[REDACTED] do that.
DOCTOR: So you know.
SECOND PERSON M903
No more reaching for the bag.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON M903
And you leaning this way, you know falling over.
DOCTOR: Absolutely.
SECOND PERSON M903
But then he got up and went back then he fell back.
DOCTOR: Backwards yeah.
SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Parkinson's huh?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Similar to it yeah.  Like we can't confirm that yet until you go to the neurologist but that's what this other doctor is thinking that it's a Parkinson's like type syndrome.  I will give you some information about that before you leave today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so I know those were the big things on your mind.
SECOND PERSON M903
We can deal with that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON M903
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Very.
SECOND PERSON M903
Give it all.
DOCTOR: That's all I've got for you now.
SECOND PERSON M903
Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: We will know more once we see the brain doctor.  He's the guy who's gonna be able to really um give us the sense of what's going on.
SECOND PERSON M903
And that's why he be having the shakes like that?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  All of it is tied together.
SECOND PERSON M903
Cause sometimes he can just shake, shake, shake.
PATIENT: Yeah one night I was shaking so bad it was terrible.
DOCTOR: Do you guys remember Michael J. Fox?
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's what he's got Parkinson's?
DOCTOR: He has Parkinson's.
SECOND PERSON M903
Right and Cassius Clay.
PATIENT: Cassius Clay don't have Parkinson's does he?
SECOND PERSON M903
Yes he do uh what's his name?
PATIENT: Mohammed Ali.
DOCTOR: Mohammad Ali.
SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah I called him Cassius Clay but yeah he has it.
PATIENT: Hmm.  That a rich folks disease huh?
SECOND PERSON M903
No [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So um I want you to know though I'm giving you information for Parkinson's disease but that's not exactly what you might have.
SECOND PERSON M903
That's not what he has.
DOCTOR: Because you know with anything you know whether its lung disease or heart disease there's always you know a couple of different options.  Everything's just a little bit different than the other one but I'm just giving you sort of the basic gist.
SECOND PERSON M903
Yes, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then as we continue to sort of work with the neurologist we'll have a much better idea okay.  So I will print this uh, I'll do that before we leave today.  Let's talk about a couple other things.
SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um alright.  Any chest pain recently?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  And how about pain in your legs?
PATIENT: I've had a little just today.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

PATIENT: In the mid-calf.
DOCTOR: In the mid-calf, just one?  Right up there?
PATIENT: Right, right up here, just one leg.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON M903

DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON M903
You know but we be walking up two flights of stairs.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON M903
So that gets to me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely.  Where do you find, do you find that your legs hurt by the time you're on the second flight of stairs or not really?
PATIENT: No they don't usually hurt when I'm going up stairs.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have fallen back also.
SECOND PERSON M903
He still be, he still be clumsy cause I have to be behind him.
DOCTOR: Okay.
DOCTOR: I think it's good that you guys are moving back to the first floor.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think that will be great.
SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah that be good too.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Any symptoms in terms of shortness of breath while you're walking or when you're exercising?
PATIENT: Exercising (laughs).
SECOND PERSON M903

SECOND PERSON M903

PATIENT: Go straight to bed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON M903

DOCTOR: Any problems with uh feeling like you haven't finished um that you still have urine but you're not able to completely empty?  No.
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: No? Alright.  Your blood pressure looks good today so we'll go ahead and not change anything in terms of your blood pressure medications.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um let's see.
PATIENT: Now then the metoprolol.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I stopped taking it during the day.
DOCTOR: You have?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How come?
PATIENT: Cause it was making me sleepy and tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Why did you feel like it was the metoprolol versus all the other things?
PATIENT: My sister told me that's what it was.
DOCTOR: Oh.
SECOND PERSON M903
Who you told you that?
PATIENT: NAME.
SECOND PERSON M903
How does only one person know your medicine?
PATIENT: I don't take that one in the morning but I do take it at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.

SECOND PERSON M903

SECOND PERSON M903
But baby you don't do nothing.

SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah I know but you getting ready to take more now.
PATIENT: Well shit.
SECOND PERSON M903
More pills now okay.
DOCTOR: Well I don't know if it's for your blood pressure, let me just make sure.
PATIENT: I thinks the metoprolol is.
DOCTOR: It could also be used for your heart rate so I just need to check one thing, going back in time.  Okay so we're fine.  If you really feel that way and looking at your heart rate, if you haven't taken it this morning then that's fine.  I'm okay with you holding off on the metoprolol.
PATIENT: I haven’t been taking it for the month.
DOCTOR: Okay you haven't taken it okay.
PATIENT: At least for the entire month.
DOCTOR: Alright so we'll say um, I'm gonna have to figure out how to reduce your metoprolol but maybe we can cut back on the dose okay.  Because it is a medication you're supposed to be taking twice a day.  It doesn't work.
SECOND PERSON M903
But he don't take it.
DOCTOR: But you know what we could do.
SECOND PERSON M903
Oh yeah, I know you told me that but I didn't know you had stopped taking it.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll have to.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we'll have to figure that part out.
SECOND PERSON M903
You better believe the MD.
PATIENT: She's telling me what it was she said I used it the other way.
SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah but still people die of resistance.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I don't know that the metoprolol is really contributing to your feelings of fatigue but um we'll see what we can do to try to.
SECOND PERSON M903
He still hasn't changed.  He still be in the bed all the time and he be constantly be tired but.
PATIENT: Yeah but I don't be sleeping.
SECOND PERSON M903
You don't be sleeping.
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON M903
You don't be sleeping at night, so like you said.

SECOND PERSON M903
So what are you saying?  You want to be [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don't know.
SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let's just see for a second here.  Your last CBC, maybe you're anemic.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You're a little bit anemic at 12.7 but that's barely, I mean that's just a little bit lower than what we would think um.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um your MCV looks fine.  [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON M903
I wish my doctor would do that [REDACTED], she's good.
DOCTOR: And your iron levels were fine, too, the last time I checked because I did check um because you were just a little bit anemic we wanted to make sure that you were okay, so I don't think it's that in terms of what's making you fatigued.  Um it could be Parkinson's.  Are you eating alright?
PATIENT: Hell yes.
DOCTOR: Are you having any problems sleeping at night?  Does he snore at night?
SECOND PERSON M903
He do have a problem with sleeping but then when he do sleep he be like [REDACTED].  He be like talking and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So he doesn't sleep very restful.
SECOND PERSON M903
[REDACTED] talking out of his head. I’ll wake him up. He'll say no, he'll be doing something like the other night, uh you were doing something with a dog or something, was it a dog or something and I said what are you doing and he said oh I'm just.  No I know what it was.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON M903
He got up and just started lighting a cigarette, so he was going like this.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON M903
Do you remember that?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
SECOND PERSON M903
He was doing like this and I said what'd be doing?  And he said I'm trying to light this cigarette.  I said what cigarette and then he woke up. I thought he was woke.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON M903
And he said I'm trying to light the cigarette and I said wake up and he said oh I was asleep and then in the morning I asked him and he don't even remember.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON M903
Doing it oh yeah sometimes he'll do something and I'll ask him right then and there, oh I was, he be like he won't but then the next thing I know he's snoring so he still be talking in his sleep.
DOCTOR: So is he snoring every night when he's sleeping?
SECOND PERSON M903
No, no.
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON M903
You know he may be but he don't take his dentures out his mouth.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON M903
So his tongue be like this so I think he would snore.
DOCTOR: Do you think he’s snoring?  Cause it could be that you're not sleeping well at night and that's why um you feel a lot of daytime sleepiness.  So there's a test.
SECOND PERSON M903
But he don't sleep that much so he can't sleep.
PATIENT: I can't sleep during the daytime.
SECOND PERSON M903
He be taking naps but he don't know he be taking naps.  He don't go [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So that kind of sounds like somebody who's not sleeping very well at night um.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um so I think what we can do is um we can do a test called a sleep study when you come here for a night and they monitor how you sleep.
SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And if they find that you have um difficulty or you're snoring a lot, they can give you a machine that allows you to sleep better at night called a CPAP machine.
SECOND PERSON M903
But he don't snore like this.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You don't think so; you don't think this is a problem?
SECOND PERSON M903
No he was telling me he was just saying he'll tell me that he didn't go to sleep until about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.
DOCTOR: So you're not sleeping.
SECOND PERSON M903

PATIENT: Right.
SECOND PERSON M903
He do be asleep.  He don't know that he's asleep so he don't be getting cause he be talking but he be asleep.

SECOND PERSON M903
It be on all night.  He leaves it on.

SECOND PERSON M903
You be going “uh huh” and you be too quick to answer.

DOCTOR: Okay I'm sorry.  I may put you on a daily aspirin.  I'm surprised it hasn't been ordered.
PATIENT: I take one.
DOCTOR: You do?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But you're buying them at the store?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  So that's why I don't see them anywhere else.  I'm like I can't believe I don't have you on a daily aspirin.
PATIENT: I was on it before I used to get it from here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Then I found out it was cheaper.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Good.
PATIENT: To get it at the store.
DOCTOR: Alright I'm glad you're doing that.  Oh I do, I see I have it on my list; it's just not on this list though.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: For a minute there I was worried.  You're right; they are a little cool to the touch.  I just want to check this here.  Alright.  Well I would say that we have you on everything that we need to have you on in terms of your um peripheral vascular disease, you're on an aspirin.  You're taking your simvastatin right now.  I would say that if it's not getting worse um we can stick with it.  The key to this disease is basically what's happening is that we're having a build-up of cholesterol throughout your body and it's making it hard for the blood to flow.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So the key to this is that, it’s just like exercising.  Like if you, say if you're walking one block and you're developing that pain in the back of your leg.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Every day you want to walk a little bit further so today's a block, tomorrow you're gonna walk a block.
PATIENT: Like a half.
DOCTOR: Ten steps. Yeah and slowly but surely that will improve so that's the only real thing that we can do um is to try to exercise because you know as things progress then you start getting into like getting stents in your legs and things like that but anything that we can do to try to improve it on our own, is much better.
SECOND PERSON M903
So he always be tired.  We gonna start walking.
PATIENT: Yeah I feel very weak too when I fall.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And try to get up.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I have no strength.
DOCTOR: I think this all is related to the blood pressure issues and so I think we're definitely gonna need some guidance as well from the neurologist about how to deal with your blood pressure issues cause I don't want to be you know doing things that make it worse.
SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So um we'll definitely get you in to see the neurologist as soon as we can okay.  And I think some of your medications are going to change depending on what they say alright.
SECOND PERSON M903
Okay.
DOCTOR: Give me one second, I'm gonna be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  50:24  DOCTOR IN:  67:39)
