DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Go ahead and have a seat over there.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's okay.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh so how uh, so yeah I'm sorry to hear about that.  Yeah you got the lesion on the larynx there, I was hoping that wasn’t going to be what it was when I sent you there.
PATIENT: Yeah well.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So sorry.
PATIENT: Well the good news is they caught it in time.
DOCTOR: Yeah it looks like there's no spread and they're just going to pound it with the radiation.
PATIENT: Right and that should be okay.
DOCTOR: Okay that's good.  Uh alright and then you had some plaque in your cheek I guess that they biopsied.
PATIENT: Uh yeah they biopsied [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It doesn't look like it's anything major.  Alright well so but that pretty well, I mean the Ear, Nose and Throat guys are doing a good job.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um now the sugars, um what are you taking now?  You're still taking the metformin.
PATIENT: Uh the metformin and then uh Lantus.
DOCTOR: Lantus.
PATIENT: Lantus insulin.
DOCTOR: 30 units?
PATIENT: Uh yeah but the thing that happened was they had been sending it to me and for some reason the post office would send it back.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: And so my children [REDACTED] go to the pharmacy [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright so.
PATIENT: So [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And when was that?
PATIENT: Oh that was Monday.
DOCTOR: Uh so you had not gotten it.  Cause I noticed some labs from December and uh the hemoglobin A1c was doing a little worse, it was up to 8.7.  You think that and I know you were in the hospital for something else; you had another bout of pancreatitis, right.
PATIENT: Uh yeah.  So they probably improved and then got worse.  If I got a blood test today, it  would be bad.
DOCTOR: Probably be better.
PATIENT: It would be bad.
DOCTOR: Well why don't we just recheck it in a couple of months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And keep doing what we're doing uh you've been through a lot so it may have messed with the sugars.  Um.
PATIENT: I don’t know if it's related to the radiation or anything?  But I notice some tingling in my left [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay uh it's tingling?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: How often does it happen?
PATIENT: Um, uh several times a day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I don't know if it's related to the radiation or what.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Any chest pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Does it happen if you use it more or?
PATIENT: No it just comes and goes and I just noticed it started when I started the radiation.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah it could potentially be related to the radiation, it's hard to say.  Uh do you feel weakness in your arm?
PATIENT: No.  Just strange, just this strange tingling feeling.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Alright.
PATIENT: I also mentioned to the radiation doctor [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh one other thing doctor, I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh I need for you to order the patches.
DOCTOR: Oh okay yeah.

DOCTOR: You can't use uh; you cannot smoke with uh this stuff either.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh.  Do you want to pick it up today or?
PATIENT: Yes I would appreciate it if I could.
DOCTOR: Do you want the gum?  I think we have the gum.
PATIENT: Uh okay, okay.
DOCTOR: Uh and [REDACTED] lozenges.  So you take, you know you take them predominantly when you have uh cravings.
PATIENT: It must have been a long morning for you.
DOCTOR: Well it's not too bad.  Alright your blood pressure's been good.  I want to bring you back in a few months and then we'll repeat everything okay.
PATIENT: Okay, good enough.
DOCTOR: You need to get labs drawn beforehand.
PATIENT: Okay.  I can do that in a couple of days.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean it's up to you.  If you're here you can do it and otherwise you can do it the day of and you know I don't want to make you come in just for that um.  Don't worry about it, just uh.

PATIENT: In three months.
DOCTOR: Three months and we'll get the labs beforehand.  Uh I ordered the nicotine stuff so you should be able to pick it up today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just don't smoke on it.  It's got a lot of nicotine.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: And you could get a blood clot or something from this.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Uh and then I wish you well with everything with the radiation you know.  I'm glad it got caught early you know.
