DOCTOR: We're not gonna [REDACTED].
PATIENT: All this time I've being [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's alright.  I get nervous doing the same thing you know.
PATIENT: But I don't change this cause I don't if its arthritis or whatever it is man this stuff getting to me.
DOCTOR: Have you been going to Physical Therapy?
PATIENT: No because I don't have money anymore to be getting down here all the time like that.
DOCTOR: Let me honest the arthritis, there's very little.
PATIENT: I know y'all done told me, yeah I know it.
DOCTOR: That we can do but the thing that I would try to see is in my, you've seen them before, thought.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  Have they taught you exercises?
PATIENT: Yeah I do those exercises.  That was for my arms but uh now you know it's in my back.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I don't sleep well at night no more cause I'm you know aching and you know I turn over and woke up and I woke [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So this is the thing that I’m going to say.  So I know your shoulders have been giving you a lot of problems.
PATIENT: Right.  That's, it's still.  You know I ain't got no strength over my head.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It keeps locking up.
DOCTOR: If you want to consider surgery okay.
PATIENT: Uh.  You talking about cutting on my back?
DOCTOR: Not your back, your shoulder okay.
PATIENT: Well we got to talk about that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's a lot, that's fine and that's pushing it.  So I'm saying.  If you it's getting so bad that you can't do your regular daily things.
PATIENT: Yeah, like shaving, yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah so then I want you to start thinking about it, in terms of, it's an option.  It's a crappy option but it’s the only other remedy, okay.  But that’s not something you have to answer now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So to let you know what they would do is they would, you know take a look at your shoulder to see how bad it is.  They might have to replace a joint, with something mechanical and then after that you would have to go to physical therapy anyway to have them get your strength back up.  [REDACTED]it’s a pretty tough couple of months, but after that your problem is gone.
PATIENT: It would hurt, but it’d be gone you know, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah, ‘cuz you know, the ankles aching, feet swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay the only other thing.  I'm going to be honest so you know we're giving you pain medications, but physical therapy when you can do it and then the only other thing is your weight loss you know.
PATIENT: Is what?.
DOCTOR: Weight loss yeah.  [REDACTED] you weigh.
PATIENT: 213.
DOCTOR: 213 last time you were here, you weight 194.
PATIENT: Yeah I know I've gained weight.
DOCTOR: Okay.  All that stuff.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And I mean, it's kind of you're your own worst enemy in that sense you know.
PATIENT: What eating?
DOCTOR: Yeah because think about, okay, so think about your back [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And in August when I saw you, you weighed 194.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Now it's like you're carrying around a 20 pound dumb bells with you.
PATIENT: Yeah, all right here, I gotcha.
DOCTOR: So it's a lot of stress.
PATIENT: But I mean, look I been having, man I been, you know I eat all the time now.  I don't know, you know it start happening.  I'm always hungry.
DOCTOR: You got to control it. There's different ways right.  I'm not telling you not to eat but just eat the right things.
PATIENT: That's right yeah.
DOCTOR: You know, instead of fried foods, no fried foods [REDACTED].  Instead of going and reaching for a snack like a cookie or something, get an apple, just the right thing.  All that stuff makes a difference.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: And you know of course you know try to stay as active as you can you know.  I know that it's hard with the arthritis but walking and doing exercise it actually helps.  That's why we send you to Physical Therapy.
PATIENT: Yeah I know.
DOCTOR: But the thing is, I don't think that hope is lost because we just need to get you to start doing these things you know that'll help you.
PATIENT: Okay I’ll start watching my diet a little better. [REDACTED] you said If I feel a lot better, [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I've been you know forgetting a lot too doctor.  Like uh I’ll be doing something and my mind just snap.  You know [REDACTED] kind of scaring me cause I ain't used to this.
DOCTOR: How has your mood been recently, like are you feeling a little bit down?
PATIENT: Uh yeah because I want to be by myself.  You know I ain't been doing, uh I get up for a morning walk or something.  I'm mad because if I did a bad job shaving so you know I get pissed off that all it is.
DOCTOR: So you live with your daughter right now?
PATIENT: Yeah I do.
DOCTOR: So that memory stuff, the most common cause alright is depressions, stuff like that.
PATIENT: Oh really [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Cause when you start getting down like the mind starts not focusing okay.  It's just one of those things that depression does, it causes  you not to focus and causing you, you're in the middle of something and all of a sudden you forget what you're doing.
PATIENT: That's it, that's it.
DOCTOR: Right.  Um.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] you know except she be at work and I'm home by myself, that be the one time she at work but she'll call you know.  [REDACTED] take your medicine, breakfast in the  microwave too.
DOCTOR: Now I think that the thing that's always [REDACTED] connected together, you know.  You're weight gain, you're arthritis, the blood pressure, memory problems, the depression all these things are connected together right.  So what we need to do is kind of make a plan saying these are going to be your goals you know for the next time I see you okay. I’ll write them down, you know we'll make a list.

PATIENT: I know it, but it’s hard for me.
DOCTOR: But you can do it right?
PATIENT: Oh yeah I can do it because uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, no other choice, too.  So before you leave we're going to make a plan okay.
