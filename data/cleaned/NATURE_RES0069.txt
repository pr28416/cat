DOCTOR: Although the symptoms that you're experiencing, with feeling or having a fever, sore throat, and not feeling well with the muscle aches and fatigue, uhm, its relatively non-specific, so as you mentioned, it could be something like the common cold, that you've experienced in the past, so we can't rule that out either at this time, but we will do some investigations including a nasal swab for covid and kind of go from there.
PATIENT: OK, sounds good.
DOCTOR: All right, we'll get that started.
PATIENT: Great.
