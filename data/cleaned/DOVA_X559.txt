DOCTOR: Have you ever tried anything in the past?
PATIENT: In the?
DOCTOR: In terms of medication for anxiety.
PATIENT: I don't know whatever they been giving me, I been taking. Because that's I was always like keeping it cause since that time I think that was having to drink and everybody around me was drinking cause I was more relaxed when I drank and you know more often I would [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: That is what the note says though.
PATIENT: Had four DUIs, not really.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Even one is too many.

PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm reading this note here when you went to go see the psychologist in October of this past year and you told him there's a lot going on so it's like you know at that time you were still using some cocaine.  Still drinking but not as much and you know you have some issues with your wife and you're worried about your job and I think the medication you were using at the time you feel like was working for you.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And I think that they would be the best people to help you with you with this cause my concern is go on the medications that we start for anxiety um uh they're not good for people who have had a history of drinking too much alcohol.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: It gets real complicated.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you know you're here, its 11 o'clock, you're not going into work today right?

DOCTOR: And just let you you know go through life a little bit easier.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: And I want you to get started on one of them.
