DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: How you doing doc?
DOCTOR: How you doing?
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Having a nice day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yep.  Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Oh, washing [REDACTED].  Alright.  Clean water I promise.  Any problems?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yes?  Oh no.  Oh yes I've read about this, a tick bite?
PATIENT: Yeah.  It looks like it's going away though.
DOCTOR: Did it ever look like a target?  Like where it had central clearing?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Oh no.
PATIENT: Uh they took blood work.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah.
PATIENT: For you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah everything looks good.  Yeah let me pull it up for you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now I remember I looked at everyone this morning and I remember you were in the Emergency Room on Friday.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Right okay.  So the Lyme disease serology, that's what they, that takes a long time to come back so that's still pending.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and then it looks like your white blood cell count was normal and that number sometimes is high if there's an infection but with Lyme disease I don't know if it's always high, I can go look that up.  Uh your hemoglobin was fine too, it looked fine.  Everything else looked okay.  Um and then your other tests that they took um looking at basic chemistries that all looks okay too except your sugar was a bit high.  Everything was okay.
PATIENT: Yeah that's something uh, I don't know what it is but it just won't go down below 240 or 220.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I don't know how many different medications for that.
DOCTOR: Maybe yeah.  And right now we have you on metformin and that's all right?
PATIENT: Uh, I don't know the names of them.
DOCTOR: Okay so you take all, everything on this list you're taking?
PATIENT: Uh unless um which one for quit smoking?
DOCTOR: Chantix.
PATIENT: Yeah they uh said they were going to give me another month's supply of that and.
DOCTOR: You didn't get it.
PATIENT: They didn't order it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I've been off of it for probably about a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, how's your smoking coming?
PATIENT: Oh about seven or eight cigarettes a day.
DOCTOR: Better.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay, well I'll reorder that for you.  And you have the tick bite and um diabetes are probably the main issues right now then.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well I still have the pain in the neck that I will need a second shot for that.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I saw that you were being, they were looking, there's Anesthesia Notes and stuff so.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's perfect.
PATIENT: And it helps a lot, the other shot helped quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Good.  And how is the weight loss program?  Not good?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You did well initially.  You were excited about it initially.
PATIENT: Yeah I, well I've been going to it and uh lost uh about 23 pounds but I've gained about five of it back.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: Well.
PATIENT: And that's just been in the last month.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well keep going.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It can't be easy.
PATIENT: No it's not.
DOCTOR: You know, if it was easy everyone would be you know a normal size but it's not easy so.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Keep trying um.  I'm wondering if we should increase your metformin.  Right now you're on half a tablet twice a day, maybe we should go to a whole tablet twice a day.
PATIENT: I'm trying to think which one it is.  What color it is?
DOCTOR: You can Google it.
PATIENT: Is this the white one?
DOCTOR: I don't know, here let's Google one.  I wish that in my book it gave us what it looked like.  Whoa, I opened it three times.  And these look like.  Any of these look familiar?
PATIENT: Yeah the one in the middle on the right inside, down the middle yeah.
DOCTOR: And you break them in half right now, so we would go from taking one pill to taking the whole pill.
PATIENT: Twice a day.
DOCTOR: Twice a day and then I think we're kind of maxed out on it.  Let me check the list though.  I think as you lose more weight it should be, we should be able to get, you won't have to take as much of this medicine hopefully.
PATIENT: Yeah they could wire my jaw shut or something.
DOCTOR: I know, it's hard you know.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay the max dose is like 2500 a day so if you go up to 1000 a day or 2000 a day, um we're getting there and if you need something other than that, we'll probably have to go to a second drug but for right now I think it's easier to keep people on just one drug at a time.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'll give it a try.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: What was the name of it again?
DOCTOR: The metformin, so this one.  Um we're going to change to one pill twice daily and I'll reorder it so that you have the correct amount ordered.
PATIENT: I can just [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Or actually you can go at 850, why don't we do that.  Sorry I didn't realize that it came in this other dose and we'll do the 850 mg twice a day instead um, do you want them in the mail?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You can just wait till you get them in the mail.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then so we're going to change this to 850 mg twice a day.  You'll get a new prescription in the mail.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But keep doing what you're doing for now.
PATIENT: And what do I do with the extras, cause there’s
DOCTOR: Do you have a lot?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Keep them because if you end up needing a higher dose you can go back to taking one whole dose.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And we throw them away.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just keep track of what's what, put them in a drawer or something.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um okay so let's talk a little bit here.  So you were just in the Emergency Room and you said the tick bite looked like a target?
PATIENT: Yeah it was like red on the outside and white in the middle.
DOCTOR: And they started you on the doxycycline?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: How many days did they give you?
PATIENT: Seven.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How's the pain?
PATIENT: Uh there never was any pain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I just, when I was taking a shower Friday I just happened to glance down and happened to see it.
DOCTOR: Well how big was it?
PATIENT: It was about the size of a quarter.
DOCTOR: Okay but you noticed the center was light.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And the outside was dark.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Just while you’re make sure [REDACTED] don’t have to recheck it um.  Any fever, chills?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: No like fatigue, malaise, chest pain, trouble breathing?  You're feeling fine you just have the tick bite?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean the only reason I came in was because I saw it you know, other than that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I had no.
DOCTOR: And really with Lyme disease you don't want to wait, it should be treated.  Some people feel fine but if you don't treat it, it can cause problems down the road so.  And no joint pains and aches anywhere aside from your usual the neck pain and everything?
PATIENT: Correct.
DOCTOR: I think Lyme disease, from what I'm remembering, it causes an arthritis that migrates so you'll have a very severe like elbow pain or knee pain and the next day it will be in different joints um and then it can cause like heart problems too but that's only if you don't treat it so you should be okay.  I think my dog had it and we noticed that she's limping so we were like oh man what happened to her and they checked it and found it so.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But it should be fine. I'm here to make sure that we're not, make sure that we follow up on the way to check this.  And how high did you say your sugars are in the morning?
PATIENT: 240, 220.
DOCTOR: This is high.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Twice what they should be.  Um when does that class meet for, um diabetes so you know what, you know they show you what, teach you what to eat?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And what not to eat.
DOCTOR: You've seen them before haven't you?
PATIENT: Yeah but I missed, like that was the first day.
DOCTOR: Oh okay so you want to get the full.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You want to just go again?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I know that they may reject our consult so we'll.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I would think you could go back, I don't think it's a, I'll just write in our consult that you're inadequately controlled and you requested it.
PATIENT: I got in touch with Ears, Nose and Throat ‘cuz it’s been probably six or seven weeks since I went to see them for the deviated septum and the doctor told me I needed surgery and It’s like I never heard anything.  So I called him back and um the person told me that it's more of an elective surgery and that they would fit me in when things aren't so bad you know, people getting polyps removed you know different stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So that's in the works?
PATIENT: Yeah.  But it's probably another couple of months.
DOCTOR: Oh geez.  So do you have to keep checking back with them or will they contact you?
PATIENT: They're supposed to contact me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I was just, I didn't know until I called them and I think it was Friday or Thursday last week.
DOCTOR: I would keep on them you know.  If you don't hear from them in a month I would call back.  I don't know how that works but they should be able to schedule you I mean, you can't predict emergencies and they're going to have emergencies and have to bump people eventually or you know sometimes.  They should be able to schedule you so, keep on that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause if you, I feel like at all hospitals you have to be your own advocate if you can be because things get dropped.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Especially with residents, who like me, that come and go and you only come have clinic like once every two weeks and I would definitely call again, you never know so.  And nobody means to do that but I think it does happen.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um, we want to make sure that we treat you correctly.
PATIENT: The only other problem I have is the um, the oxygen concentrate um my electric bill was like $70.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: For like three months in a row and then when I got that it went up to like $220.
DOCTOR: Ah.
PATIENT: And uh my next bill was like $180 and they came and checked it last week and I asked about it, did this machine take a lot of electricity and he says oh yeah a lot so I haven’t been using it.
DOCTOR: The CPAP you mean?
PATIENT: No the CPAP I'm using, it's just the oxygen concentrator.
DOCTOR: That goes through the CPAP?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I just, you know I can't afford a $200 bill.
DOCTOR: I know, I mean oh my God I couldn't afford that either.  That's like a car payment.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  You know this article here says you should be on the doxycycline for 21 days so three weeks [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Uh for the bite oh okay yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm glad we looked it up.  So let me see if there's anything else in here that we would need to know.
PATIENT: And you're supposed to stay out of direct sunlight with that right.
DOCTOR: Yes.  You can get a burn, you'll be photo sensitive.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So let's see okay, so this trial, it looks like it's kind of it’s either 21 days or 14; so because you have no symptoms I think you could get away with two weeks instead of three.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you develop any of those symptoms like the arthralgias or rashes or anything like that then you know go ahead and give me a call.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll extend it um or we'll have you come back in.  And then I think you should be fine.  So it looks like that's all you have to do.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So let me change that to the lower while I think about it.
PATIENT: So you think I should [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh let me give you 14 days, okay.  You mean the oxygen concentrator?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I mean I know I need it but.
DOCTOR: Yeah but if you're not going to use it.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I don't disagree with you, that's crazy.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And no one ever told me that before.  They're probably just paying it and they don't even realize.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How well.
PATIENT: Well they get me, like I said last month was $220 and I called them up and I said there's got to be a problem here somewhere.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know cause my last three months didn't even equal $220 and um so they checked it again and it was right.  So you know like I said uh the guy told me it takes a lot of electricity so I quit using it.
DOCTOR: Do you still feel better using just the CPAP alone without the oxygen?
PATIENT: Yeah I feel fine I mean.
DOCTOR: Probably.
PATIENT: I sleep pretty good.
DOCTOR: It's still helping you?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um I think that that's fine.  You can probably just get rid of it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um but, let me go ask my boss and see what he thinks.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Any other issues today?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Let me make sure there's nothing else, I always write myself a note um so I make sure I'm treating everything.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  High blood pressure medication, like 114/71.
DOCTOR: That's good.  And we have you on; it looks like Lasix 20, nothing else?  Well, so you check your pressure at home?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: I'd say the last, I think the last seven times that I've been here they check my blood pressure and it's always been, the last seven times it's been that low.
DOCTOR: You have metoprolol too it looks like.  I think you can probably stop the Lasix, the water pill if you want.
PATIENT: That's the little white.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Just mark it on here with an X and I'll figure it out when I get home.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Why don't you keep it so you can stop this one and then just keep it though cause if you start accumulating fluid, like let's say your legs start getting puffy, that sort of thing then you can restart it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So it can be an as needed thing and then I would keep the metoprolol that's this one um just because that's cardio protective, it'll protect your heart okay.  The rest of the meds we'll keep the way they are.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Until you get better readings.  I think we did checked your cholesterol initially and it was good, that was back, that was just recently and it was very good so we'll continue with our therapy.  The triglycerides were kinda high.
PATIENT: How high were they?
DOCTOR: They were 278.
PATIENT: Wow.
DOCTOR: And are you taking the gemfibrozil at this time?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] everything is normal.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The last time you told me to um take fish oil too.
DOCTOR: And you've been doing that?
PATIENT: Yes.  I've been.
DOCTOR: They are higher than they were.
PATIENT: For some reason they keep fluctuating like that.  I mean it's ridiculous.  Cause the one time I had it checked it was like 210 and then the doctor put me on you know no red meat and all that kind of stuff.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I did that for like three months, went back and had it checked again and it was 2100.
DOCTOR: Now I’m remembering this, geez.
PATIENT: So I don't know.  I was hoping that that would be done with with the fish oil.
DOCTOR: Yeah I thought that would help too.  I know that helped my mom.  It helps a lot of people [REDACTED].  Well right now we have you on the gemfibrozil one tablet once a day.  You can take that twice a day and that [REDACTED] next dose.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So why don’t we try that and then we'll repeat the cholesterol next time you come see me; so I'll write it on there.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So, change, two.
PATIENT: And two would be one in the morning and one at night or two at the same time?
DOCTOR: Yeah, no one in the morning and one at night.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So when you take your metformin do the same thing.  It helps to take them at the same time and then let me change that one too.  It's still 230 [REDACTED] we need to get that down.
PATIENT: Yeah, well the last time it was checked um of course I didn't bring the paper with me, it was down.  I couldn't remember what the number was.
DOCTOR: Yeah it did come down initially to 1200 which is still high.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But it was down from where it was before, I think the first time I saw you it was 1600 and it was whoa you know but you told me it has always been like that before.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um let's just repeat some of your labs next time so [REDACTED].  So we will repeat the cholesterol, and your diabetes tests and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] does that go along with the cholesterol?
DOCTOR: It's a panel [REDACTED] we’re good there, I think.  Let me take a listen to you and then we can [REDACTED].  Am I running late yet? No. I usually try really hard. I usually have people waiting  I am sure we have people waiting out there.
PATIENT: I remember the last time I was here I was almost done at 4 o'clock and that's when my appointment was.
DOCTOR: Oh I got you in here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I like doing that, too.
PATIENT: Yeah and especially on a Friday I think.
DOCTOR: Yeah, take a deep breath.  We like patients like you.  You do everything we say and you remember everything.
PATIENT: Well I have to, if I don't you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You've made progress too.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Just keep moving.  Take some deep breaths.  Good.  This is my last year here and you'll get somebody new.  Unless I decided to stay.  I’ll probably see you a couple more times during my reign here. (Laughs)
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh, I want you to come back and see me in three months, is that okay?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: And we'll do your labs before that and they're all renewed okay.  You’re good.  Everything that we talked about has been changed.  I'm going to leave this, the one we cancelled in there just in case you need it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Burt know that you don’t have to take it.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Good to see you.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Enjoy the rest of your summer.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: 66:30
Time is 3:50.
