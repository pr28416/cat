PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: OK, yeah. Um alright, so it's sounding like most likely this would be strep throat or, or Group A strep pharyngitis with, because you have no cough, and with a high fever and swelling that you've been redness that you notice in the back of your mouth. And so we'll do a rapid strep antigen test and it will require just a throat swab. To see, to to detect for that, however with a, uh, umm, yeah, I guess that's it. That's what I yeah, well, we'll start with with that now and it could potentially be something like uhm, a viral illness, but that's lower on the on the differential then the bacterial infection is right now. And because of COVID it will be, we'll do a swab as well because people can get fever and sore throat with with COVID as well.
PATIENT: Ok.
DOCTOR: So just to make sure that we're being comprehensive.
PATIENT: OK. That sounds good. Thank you so much.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
