DOCTOR: Okay let me put in an order to go to Prosthetics or actually Pharmacy can give you a sugar monitor, I can I'll order that.

It brought it down some but not enough.  It was still like 120 or 130 every day.

DOCTOR: So maybe PSA, otherwise [REDACTED] fine.
PATIENT: Can you see the A1c that I took in there?
DOCTOR: Yeah it's extremely high.
PATIENT: Is it past 10?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It's double what it's supposed to be.
PATIENT: Double a 10?
DOCTOR: Well it's 11.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Because it should be less than 6.
PATIENT: Right.  I had got it down to 7.3.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: When I was doing really well, cause it was like 10 1/2 and I got it down to 7.
DOCTOR: Well let me have you sit up here and um do an exam.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Deep breath.  Let me see your scar, any problems?
PATIENT: Well it's kind of sore right here.  Cause there's one time when I was gaining weight back I thought they had opened a vein up.
DOCTOR: Oh, pardon.  I think it feels fine, I'm not feeling a hernia or anything like that.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I'm talking about down here.  At one time it was hurting for like a week.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I thought I'd stretched the stomach thing and it was supposed to be permanently little.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Um okay so I think as far as I think our main problems today are the diabetes and the blood pressure.  So we're gonna restart some medications which I'm gonna discuss with DOCTOR.  As far as just health screening type of stuff, I know you had a colonoscopy a few years ago.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: So you're not due for that for eight more years.  You're fine.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um we could check a PSA today um otherwise you just had all your other blood work.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I might, your one cholesterol number which we usually start medications for it looks okay but your triglycerides are really high.
PATIENT: Okay.  How.
DOCTOR: We don't like that, 473.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's supposed to be below 150.
PATIENT: I know, I know.
DOCTOR: So I might um.
PATIENT: But at one time it was 1100.
DOCTOR: Oh.  Do you have a family history of that?
PATIENT: Yeah I think so.  The other one is on cholesterol medicine.
DOCTOR: Or do you want to go on fenofibrate?
PATIENT: I don’t know what that was?
DOCTOR: I think I'm probably going to start you on that.  It's a medicine that mostly just works on the triglycerides.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But otherwise.
PATIENT: I know I got it from 1100 to 100 some, I was shocked.  It took about four months but.
DOCTOR: Well I'm gonna go talk with DOCTOR about all this and otherwise we'll, I'll get you to see somebody about that MOVE Program, the Diabetes Program.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we can kind of get you back on track okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Anything else?
PATIENT: One thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They said I supposed to go through you about getting my travel pay so you check me out.
