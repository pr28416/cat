DOCTOR: Perfect so I'll put that in.
PATIENT: And I can pick them up today uh.  Yeah that way in about three months I can make another round.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that works for you? Okay, yeah let's do that.  Um let me just check a couple things I need to do.  So last time we checked your cholesterol was recently, no it was about a year ago.  I'm gonna order labs for you.  You do not have to get them done today.
PATIENT: Well I might as well get it cause I.
DOCTOR: Cause you're here you'll get them.

DOCTOR: [REDACTED] smart.
PATIENT: Maybe you wanted to uh.
DOCTOR: Alright I.
PATIENT: Blood tests.
DOCTOR: Yes I do but I didn't think you'd go this long.  Okay let's check some labs; I'll refill your meds.  Um and you had a flex sig in 2006 that showed some diverticulosis.  Are you interested at all in doing a colonoscopy where they go up through the bottom and they take a look for colon cancer?  The test you had in the past was sort of an incomplete test.
PATIENT: It was incomplete cause.
DOCTOR: It was uncomfortable.
PATIENT: It was real uncomfortable.  They could at least put uh a local.
DOCTOR: Yeah I agree.  So the one that I want you to get is more complete and they completely knock you out.
PATIENT: Well I don't need a complete knock out.
DOCTOR: But they sedate you so that you don't remember it.  You can respond like when they're asking you questions you can respond but you won't remember it so it's not painful or anything.
PATIENT: That's what mine was, that's where I got the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You want to do that okay.
PATIENT: I don't think they found anything unusual but they.
DOCTOR: No, no, they didn't.  It just wasn't a complete study so I just wasn't sure if you.
PATIENT: I've been going on the [REDACTED] to work on the stomach.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, okay.  Well think about it.  If you decide you want to change your mind and do it we can set you up okay.  Um otherwise everything is looking pretty good.  You're doing a real good job.  Your blood pressure looks great.  You're taking your aspirin.  Um sounds like all the GU stuff and your urology stuff has gotten.
PATIENT: Right, no problem.
DOCTOR: Good well let me go talk to the boss.  Let me take a listen to you, then I'll talk to the boss and we'll get you out of here.  We'll send you to the Lab; we'll send you to the Pharmacy.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Go ahead and lean forward just a little bit.  Forward, there you go.  Big breath.  Another one.  Good you can breathe normal, I'm gonna listen to your heart.  Good.  Let me go talk to the boss and we'll get you out of here.

DOCTOR: Alright sir.
PATIENT: You know I was thinking, I want to mention something.  I did go to the doc, some kind of growth.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That needs to come out, on the side here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um cause then I will send you over to the skin doctors.
PATIENT: Right, dermatologist.
DOCTOR: Yes, you got it.  Amlodipine 30 day supply.  So I changed your finasteride medication to be a three month supply, cause the way Urology wrote it out it was only 30 pills um otherwise I restarted your amlodipine and your lisinopril.  I'm going to put in for your labs now and you can just go get it.  Let's see.  And then why don't you come back and see me in three months, does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's the Blue Clinic and [REDACTED] you're all set to go.  And your meds should be waiting for you at the Pharmacy.  Everything's in the Lab.
