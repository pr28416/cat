DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yo.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It never fails, whatever side I sit on the doctor come out the other side.
DOCTOR: How are you doing today?
PATIENT: Well I'm not so good.
DOCTOR: We can talk about it.
PATIENT: Okay.  I got it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Put my stuff over here?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  What's going on?
PATIENT: Well, it's to be expected.  I have cancer of both lungs.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I'm on chemo.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So there gonna be some good days and some bad days.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: This would be one of my bad days you know, a little dizzy but no pain or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm not falling down dizzy you know.
DOCTOR: Do you feel.
PATIENT: Sort of like you feel after you have three shots you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I think that, I was just looking through your chart.  I think we can stop one of your blood pressure medicines.  So the blood pressure is pretty low, has it ever been high since we started the chemo?
PATIENT: Uh no.  In fact, a couple of times.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It has, you know its bottom.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Has been in the 90s.
DOCTOR: In the 90s yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think we should, if it's alright with you, try stopping the blood pressure medicine, the hydrochlorothiazide.
PATIENT: Oh that's the little yellow pill.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It makes you get up sometime at night.
DOCTOR: The water pill right.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um I'll talk with DOCTOR but I think and that'll help you from being, so you were losing water by taking that and so.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That causes some dizziness and some low blood pressures.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But maybe we could try.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause I don't think you need it anymore.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: For a long period, as long as my blood pressure been down.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's going, let me just check and see.
PATIENT: Well I feel, well I still have my nifedipine.
DOCTOR: You still have the nifedipine?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What's that uh, let's see.  How much of that are you taking?
PATIENT: Well, it was 90 right?
DOCTOR: Right, it's 90.
PATIENT: 90 mg.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let's talk with DOCTOR.  I think we should go down on one of these blood pressure medicines.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Either the nifedipine we can, since that's a pretty strong dose maybe we could just cut it to 60 instead of 90.
PATIENT: Hey good.
DOCTOR: Or we could get rid of the hydrochlorothiazide.
PATIENT: Completely.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Until further notice.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll, I'll talk to him and see what he thinks is the.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Better thing to do.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Any fevers or chills?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Just the dizziness.
PATIENT: Yes, you know just the dizziness.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I was dizzy.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I had chemo three weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And right after you know, the body said hey what's this you giving me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh and I been doing pretty good you know.  I no longer getting the blood-streaked sputum you know.
DOCTOR: That's good.
PATIENT: I hope it is.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  And then did they talk to you about how many cycles of chemo you have to get or?
PATIENT: Uh right now they said, not to hold them to it, it all depends on the tests they take.
DOCTOR: How you're doing.
PATIENT: And what have you but they said approximately.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Six - three weeks apart.
DOCTOR: Three weeks apart each one.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You're going good.
PATIENT: Well I'm hanging in there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So do you live with anyone then or?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Do you live by yourself or do you have someone to kind of help you out?
PATIENT: Uh I live in a building with 150 apartments.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh.
DOCTOR: Your neighbors are pretty nice?
PATIENT: Noisy, but sometimes that come in handy.  Once you get past 75 you can, you know the neighbors you know.  So they always want to know where you been and all that and you know when you came out, those type of neighbors.  I appreciate them, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, right.  So nobody stays like with you in the house though?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you that, would you like to if I could get it set up that a visiting nurse come by and just check on you once a week?  Just so you know if you need anything you know she could help get it.  I'll have to see if I can get that set up but you probably would qualify if you think that would help you.
PATIENT: Oh BNA?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Do you have that already or?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No okay, yeah.  I think it might be helpful at this point in time.
PATIENT: I agree with you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I'll see if I can get that set up.
PATIENT: Oh she can make suggestions you know.
DOCTOR: Sure, yeah.
PATIENT: You know maybe you should go to the hospital.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Lighten up on the crown royal, you know things like that.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: But I think it'd be a good idea.
DOCTOR: I think so too.  I'll see if I can, it'll take a while for it to get set up to but.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: But we'll get that started and um did you need any refills on any medications or anything?
PATIENT: Well, if he cut the hydrochlorothiazide to say 60.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I mean to [REDACTED] the nifedipine to say 60, I would need to get that refilled so I don't take the old 90 mg.
DOCTOR: Sure.  We will uh.
PATIENT: And only hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg is probably as low at it goes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well I'll ask him and see which one is better to do.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: Okay.  Yeah he's a good man.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean either one is probably fine so.  I'll ask him.  Let me just take a listen to you and you want to sit up here for me?
PATIENT: Okay.

PATIENT: You know I like the way you do things.  Oh about ten years ago.
DOCTOR: And do you have trouble eating or anything?
PATIENT: Uh no I eat soft food you know.
DOCTOR: You eat soft food.
PATIENT: And uh, according how this chemical thing works out you know if the process should go in remission or something then I worry about the teeth.
DOCTOR: Sure, no I understand.  That's more important right now.
PATIENT: Yeah.  So why worry about uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Putting dentures in the gum.
DOCTOR: Deep breath for me.  Good, good.  Did they tell you had [REDACTED] cause I don't hear anything.

PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: They can get discolored like the bottom side finger [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Both hands [REDACTED] very much.
DOCTOR: Yeah its part and usually when that happens it's because people smoke a lot and then you worry about cancer, so the cancer causes the problem.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So it's uh nothing, we can't really do anything to change it.  You could just um you know clip your nails but they don't look that long I don’t know.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  I clipped them last night.
DOCTOR: Yeah so but yeah it's just part of the.
PATIENT: Part of the, part of the situation.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: I have a power port on the right side.
DOCTOR: Now what is it?

DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: So we remove more pills.
DOCTOR: Right.  Right and if your blood pressure goes high you can start taking it again but I don't think it's gonna go high, right so.  Alright and then I'll put in for the nursing to come visit you and that could get set-up over the next couple of weeks okay.
