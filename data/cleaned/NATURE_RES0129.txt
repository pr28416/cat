DOCTOR: OK, any trouble recently?
PATIENT: No no.
DOCTOR: No, OK. Well, those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?
PATIENT: Uhh no, just was wondering what what might be going on?
DOCTOR: Yeah, for sure, so right now it sounds like a viral picture. It sounds like he has a cold and possibly an ear infection. I'd have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more uhm because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we'll probably do a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm and so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things, so if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated, or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him a 10 day course of antibiotics, and if I see like middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging, and he seems really sick like he has a high fever, what she does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has a middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick, we can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. Uhm An antibiotic that we usually prescribe is amoxicillin. Uhh how does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds really good. Thank you.
DOCTOR: OK, no worries. Take care.
