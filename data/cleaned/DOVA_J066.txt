DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: How you doing?
DOCTOR: Okay and yourself?
PATIENT: Good.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Follow me.  Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: How have you been?
SECOND PERSON J066
He's been real good.
PATIENT: My only problem so far, well other than the blood pressure that I just found out it was high, I fell back in the middle of January.  I tripped and uh injured my wrist and uh but it's not getting any better, my wrist.  When I fell it swelled uh and there was pain in the shoulders and I get a burning sensation in the shoulders, but that's subsided and my left shoulder is a little bit, not the same as it was prior to the fall, it's not gotten any better.
DOCTOR: Which hand is it?
PATIENT: The right hand.
DOCTOR: And the right shoulder?
PATIENT: Left shoulder.  Yeah and it continues.  This is minor so the wrist is not [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's been going on for the past three months you think?
PATIENT: Um since the middle of January, so about two months.
DOCTOR: And you've been able to use that hand or you still?
PATIENT: I use it but I'll give you, I brought this cause I tried to write something the other day and this is what happens with my signature.  It shook so bad that that's how it looks.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: So when I start, when I held the pen, it started to shake and that is sort of a representation of what I was trying to write.  There's pain in this position like that and it's located here and here and this area here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So like I can't push down, like if I was laying down and to do a push -up or something like that it's different.  The only other little bitty minor thing would be holding where the incision is on the foot, where they did a surgery a year ago and [REDACTED] surgery minor and sometimes there's some numbness in the area but I guess that’s to be expected.
DOCTOR: You're still able to walk and do everything else?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, the foot is actually 100% better than it was prior to the surgery.
DOCTOR: And how did you end up falling, do you remember?
PATIENT: Oh the first.
DOCTOR: For [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay, what was happening is uh a dog, a lady and was walking a dog and the sidewalk, a tree must have lifted up the sidewalk and I wasn't paying attention to the sidewalk as much as the other dog coming, approaching us and there was a change in elevation or whatever between one angle of the sidewalk to the other and I tripped on that.  Since then I've been the townhouse has used asphalt to repair that area so that.
DOCTOR: Any lightheadedness or anything?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Any lightheadedness?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any chest pain or feeling like your heart's racing?
PATIENT: No, you know I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Did you lose any consciousness?
PATIENT: No I have not, no, just when I go to sleep.
DOCTOR: Oh good.
PATIENT: Although my mother used to say I was unconsciousness all the time.
DOCTOR: Any falls previously?
PATIENT: Uh that's how I broke my foot though back in 2009; I tripped over a drywall lift so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm not that prone to falling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see.
PATIENT: I was looking at a hammer and there was an apparatus there's three legs that come out and I was looking beyond the legs sticking out and I tripped on it. I actually didn't fall.  I put my foot off to prevent the fall and the stress I guess.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Caused the break.  Technically I didn't fall, fall okay.
DOCTOR: So as far as the medications, you're still up-to-date, do you need any medications?
PATIENT: No I'm okay.  Yet there was one that was discontinued um [REDACTED] I think.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] a cholesterol.
DOCTOR: And that was discontinued or?
PATIENT: No, it just ran out.
DOCTOR: How long ago did you last take it?
PATIENT: Gee I don't remember I'd say a couple months ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh uh.  Zocor and simi-es, whatever, I can't pronounce either one of those.  Blood pressure was high.  And then the nurse said something, I don't know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED] a blood pressure cuff.
PATIENT: But I haven't taken the blood pressure medication today.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And you're still taking the pantoprazole?
PATIENT: Yes I do.
DOCTOR: Is that for reflux?
PATIENT: Yes uh-huh. It doesn’t stop it as much of it seems like antacids.  Um there was a period where in one week that I got three episodes of reflux and uh aspiration in the lung.  That's not caused by uh food intake it's based on really how tired I am for some reason.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh other than that one week for a three episodes, or so, very few, few and far between.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  And how has your weight been?
PATIENT: It's gaining.  I think it was around 200 today.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's a problem.
DOCTOR: You been trying to gain weight?
PATIENT: No I was not.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you exercising?
PATIENT: Each night I walk about three miles with the dog.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it's not really exercising.
DOCTOR: Still [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm not sedentary.
DOCTOR: Sedentary, yeah. Any burning when you pee?  Or any difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: No.  Nothing really other than the wrist right now, nothing.
DOCTOR: Any shortness of breath, cough?
PATIENT: No, just the only coughing occurred after one of those, that  week, there was some sort of mucus coming up from – that subsided shortly thereafter and that was nothing.
DOCTOR: I was looking at the x-rays of the wrist.
PATIENT: What would be here?
DOCTOR: Various bones and it has like eight bones and so.
PATIENT: It's just this part, junction right, it junctions.
DOCTOR: Yeah but it still potentially be a bone that's in there.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So it could be a nerve, so just get an x-ray and we can send you to physical therapy as well [REDACTED] means to kind of strengthen the joint if there's something else that's causing problems.
PATIENT: I really hasn’t gotten better. It one of those things especially if you fall in front of a woman or a girl, you're like it could be broken, whatever, you just get up and “I'm fine.”
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Then you go home and cry but like it did swell.  I don't recall any black and blue, [REDACTED] but the hand just swelled in this area.  This side gives me more pain than this side.  This is the side that swelled.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke at all?
PATIENT: No I don't smoke and I don't drink.  I assume the MOVE Clinic, it's some sort of exercise program?
DOCTOR: It is yeah.  Are you interested in it?
PATIENT: Is that somewhere you do cardiovascular?
DOCTOR: Not just no.
PATIENT: What do they do?
DOCTOR: Here they work on diet and various exercise programs that one can do to help people lose weight.
PATIENT: Let me see if I could do it by myself.  But it's something if I can't, I would be interested.  I really enjoyed the cardiovascular program that they had here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know the rehab.
DOCTOR: Yeah any history of any sexually transmitted diseases that you know of?
PATIENT: No.  How much longer will you be working at Loyola?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]  it's 15 months yeah.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  So where are you hoping to go afterwards?
DOCTOR: Really I've not decided.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: I have family in Minneapolis and Pittsburgh.
PATIENT: Minneapolis uh it's kind of wintry up there, well not now.  It was a couple of weeks now.
DOCTOR: So yeah, I can't really say, we'll see.
PATIENT: People go to new clinics, not a bad place.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Most of Minneapolis.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had an ultrasound of your liver before?
PATIENT: No I have not.  [REDACTED] enzymes.
DOCTOR: Yeah I think they've been up in the past before.  They’re up at this time.
PATIENT: Extremely?
DOCTOR: Not extremely, 60s, 100s. Normal is under 40 [REDACTED].  No abdominal pain that you’re having?
PATIENT: No nothing.  Is that from the [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: It could be.  You're not having any kind of muscle aches or anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You've been taking that medication for a while too?
PATIENT: Yes, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Something I can just continue to watch as well.
PATIENT: Hmm.  Now what was it 60?
DOCTOR: One was 60 and the other one's 100.
PATIENT: And both of them are supposed to be?
DOCTOR: The first one's supposed to be under 40 and the second one is under 60.
PATIENT: Oh they're elevated.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Hmm.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah I definitely think we should do an ultrasound and check some other labs.  No weakness or fatigue?
PATIENT: No not really.
DOCTOR: No change in the skin color, rashes or anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Joint pain?
PATIENT: Joint pain here.
DOCTOR: Other than that wrist?
PATIENT: No nothing, nothing.
DOCTOR: Good okay.  Deep breath through your mouth.  Good, you can breathe normal.  Do you get any swelling in your legs at all?
PATIENT: No nothing.  This is where the pain, with the stents, prior to the stents, prior to the surgery, came from.  Not uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No I don't have anything like that.
DOCTOR: I've had other patients with that similar.
PATIENT: And it was bilateral on both sides.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh on this side.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: So I'm very aware of pain that might originate or doing it.
DOCTOR: Relax your arm.  Not too bad, I got 150/78.  It should be under 140.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So not terrible.  Just lay back for me.  And you said you didn't take your medications [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And just turn your head to the left.  Okay go ahead and sit back up.  Have a seat in the chair that you were.  Any pain?
PATIENT: No pain, not when you touch it.
DOCTOR: Are you able to do this?
PATIENT: I could do it but this is where it starts the pain.
DOCTOR: And what about the other wrist?
PATIENT: That's fine.
DOCTOR: How far back could you put them?
PATIENT: I could all the way back; this is where the pain is originating.
DOCTOR: And what about when I do this?  Going up the side and this side [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Not so much, much less than it was.  The other thing is when I would shake somebody's hand right after, oh about a month after shaking their hand would be a problem.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: This was the position that causes the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay and hold your fingers out like this, go ahead and squeeze [REDACTED].  Now squeeze my fingers as tight as you can.
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: I want you to squeeze me just like that.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: As tight as you can, don’t let me pull back.  [REDACTED].  Your strength is a little decreased.  Is it hard when you try to write or sign your name?
PATIENT: Um it changes when I write.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that was an example of what happens but not all the time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Only at times.
DOCTOR: I'll talk with some of the other doctors and I'll be back then.
PATIENT: Okay.  My liver enzymes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They were elevated before.  I had taken part in a clinical trial many, many years ago with the Zocor and [REDACTED] they put them together and [REDACTED] medical research.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And um my liver enzymes went pretty high there and they took me off that study.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We can see.  It can cause enzymes to go up, as you know.  But looking at your enzymes from before and it's over years [REDACTED] a while and then [REDACTED] a few times in 2005 up to 2011 you were always high and you were taking it then so I don't know.  It's interesting to see now and you've had times before they were a little higher.
PATIENT: Okay I didn't even [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: We'll [REDACTED].  Something that hasn't helped you, your cholesterol numbers have been good, let's take a look at that, we want you kind of under 100 for sure and maybe under 70.  There are times here you're pretty good like under 70, 70 and this time you're up to 104 so you're above where we want you.  We definitely want you under 100.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And so it's a just a matter of statin doing that.  Also weight loss and exercise can play a role in that too.
PATIENT: Depending on my weight.
DOCTOR: Yeah you're weight has gone up 10 pounds and so this could be a reflection of the weight more than anything too so.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Something we need to consider to.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But I'll talk with the other doctor and we'll see the next steps okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  86:40  DOCTOR IN:  92:40)
DOCTOR: Okay so we're gonna continue the statin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll just recheck the labs in the future at the next visit so we might six months, check and we'll give you a blood pressure cuff, we'll do x-rays of the wrist.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We'll do an ultrasound of the liver to see and make sure it's what we think it is, this just may be because of, they call it fatty liver sometimes fat infiltrates the liver and it can cause these enzymes to go up.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll just make sure that's the reason behind this.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then I'll get you a splint for the wrist.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] ace bandages for support.
DOCTOR: You don't want a splint then?
PATIENT: I don’t think so.  Let's see what the x-ray shows first.
DOCTOR: And then I'll have them send this blood pressure cuff to your house.
PATIENT: Concerned about a couple things, one my weight, the blood pressure and the liver enzymes.  And this a fatty, what do you call, the liver or is that something that will clear up?
DOCTOR: With weight control and [REDACTED] um.  There’s really, just weight and time progressed further and some other risk factors like hepatitis, viral hepatitis or alcoholic hepatitis.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um it can progress further as well.
PATIENT: I'll try to stay on the same dosage of blood pressure medicine.
DOCTOR: Yeah your pressure is nearly where we want it to be.  In fact you can just stay on the same medication that should do it.
PATIENT: Monitor that.  Uh feeling well is deceiving.
DOCTOR: Numbers don't prove it.
PATIENT: Now the ultrasound they'll schedule that?
DOCTOR: Yeah you can maybe even schedule it at the front desk.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I put these labs in for three months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I think I should see you back then.
PATIENT: So in three months I would come and get.
DOCTOR: Just the blood work.
PATIENT: Just the blood work and then they would be given to you and then if anything out of the ordinary you'll contact me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  We can see you back in six months.
PATIENT: And you'll reorder the [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  We'll just do fasting labs in three months’ time.
PATIENT: Okay.  They'll send out a letter or just show up.
DOCTOR: Yeah they'll send probably a letter I believe.  Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you are going to get the x-rays today [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And then again if there's something wrong with the x-ray you'll contact me or somebody will?
DOCTOR: Definitely.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Any other questions you have?
PATIENT: No, nothing.  My concern were the three things I mentioned the blood pressure, the weight and uh that helps with the wrist support thing.
DOCTOR: Did you want to try the MOVE Program?
PATIENT: Um let me see how, it should come down with the warmer weather and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: If it doesn't I will definitely contact you.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I did not realize that I was up that high.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I'll go for the x-ray and get that done today.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then labs in three months.
PATIENT: Right okay.  Do I take that?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You can give it up front.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You can schedule the ultrasound okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You take care [REDACTED].
PATIENT: 98:45
Time is 3:10.
