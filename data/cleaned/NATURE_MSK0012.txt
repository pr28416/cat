PATIENT: Um a little bit of limp yeah,  I'm putting more weight on the left leg.
DOCTOR: OK, alright, so yeah, those are just some of the questions I I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all?
PATIENT: Um no, what can I do about this back pain and how long do you think I'll have it for?
DOCTOR: Yeah, so it's been happening for one month right and you're getting some symptoms in in your lower leg, so normally we would wait before we do any kind of diagnostic imaging. But since you're also having these other symptoms we we were worrying about sometimes lower back pain can lead to something called sciatica. It's just when one of the nerves get pinched, and then that's why you're getting the tingling around your right upper leg. So what we can do is. We can do if you haven't had an X Ray, we can do an X Ray of your lower back. And then we can also do an MRI.
PATIENT: OK
DOCTOR: And. Based on what results come back at the same time we will, I will give you some information about some anti- inflammatory medications you could take to help relieve some of your pain, but other than that I will also refer you to some physiotherapy. That will help you do some exercises at home. Just ways to protect your back as well as strengthen some of your muscles to help deal with some of that pain. Yeah, so we'll get the results back. And then we'll go from there.
PATIENT: OK, sounds good. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Take care.
