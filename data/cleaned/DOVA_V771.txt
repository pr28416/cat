PATIENT: We went down there one time, we were going to Florida of course and we're coming back and it was the final four in basketball and there was, that was on and something else was on and it was raining and the traffic was really horrible and I decided that we never went down 65 again, we always go back through Alabama and all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Oh really.  Yeah it's pretty bad.  Where in Florida do you go?
PATIENT: Saint Pete beach.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  So you always go back down there?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Yeah see I called in for lisinopril and I spoke to the lady yesterday and I told her I was coming to see you today and she said well you talk with your doctor about getting lisinopril.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So, I'm just trying to update all this.
PATIENT: Yeah many years ago my daughter's girlfriend, she went through Loyola and now she's got, she's working with a couple other doctors as a cardiologist and so.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: She went through probably the same thing you're going through now.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Where does she work?
PATIENT: Downtown city now, she had to stay in the city cause she married a cop.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: (Laughter).
DOCTOR: Where do you get the metformin from?
PATIENT: From you I guess.
DOCTOR: Well I don't see it. (keeps looking in record) [REDACTED] expired.  Do you, did you want to pick this stuff up?
PATIENT: No just have it shipped to the house, that'd be great.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So it'll get there before you have to go.
PATIENT: Oh gosh yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause usually I get it, you know when I call it in, it's you know 5-10 days or less sometimes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh, we're not gonna be going for another week and a half so I'm okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um, I'm trying to figure out uh, I'm gonna have to ask how we can give you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Well don't get yourself in trouble doctor, you know hey.
DOCTOR: No, no, I'm sure there's a way to do it, I just don't know how, how to get it done.
PATIENT: Yeah that's all my doctor.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Tell your wife [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh, I even got one for her.  Yeah, she said in case the paramedics come and get me.  They won't know to look in my purse, I say yes dear.
DOCTOR: Um, so your blood pressure looks good.  Are you checking it at home?
PATIENT: Yes ma'am.
DOCTOR: And what's it normally?
PATIENT: It's usually in the 130s over 70s.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then I prick my finger periodically to check diabetes and I'm always under 140.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When are you checking?
PATIENT: I'm checking uh, like, well not today but I have my little list, I should have brought that list for you.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But like today I would check a.m., you know before breakfast and then two hours afterwards.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And maybe, today is what Wednesday, Friday I'll check lunch, before lunch and after lunch and Sunday, oh no Sunday.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No Sunday, Sunday there's a cocktail or two at least on Sunday.
DOCTOR: Um so when you do the very early morning ones, what's your numbers?
PATIENT: Sometimes it scares the heck out of me doctor.  It's, one time it was like 170-180, something like that.  Gosh I wish I'd brought it with me and I told my wife about it and she says wow, so I rechecked it a couple mornings after that and everything went down.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And the only thing we can attribute it to is either we had a snack that night or maybe an ice cream or something like that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh, I'm like a closet drinker, but Fridays I like to have a cocktail Friday evening cause I've done that from the day I started working and then Sunday before dinner and that's about all I drink now days.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Compared to when I was in my youth.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But uh, that was the only time it was high.
DOCTOR: But that was just one time?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Yeah cause the next morning you know she said let's check it again and then I was down to 127 or something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright um, so the early morning ones, do you know what our goal was?
PATIENT: All I can do is when I was in for my last uh, uh angiogram my DOCTOR, my regular doctor.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She uh, she's a diabetic nut and uh she had people from the Diabetes Office come over.
DOCTOR: Come by.
PATIENT: Come over and talk to me and what they wanted to maintain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they said I was borderline and if I watch what I eat and I do, I work out three times a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
DOCTOR: Great.
PATIENT: And uh they said you know I won't have to go on the medicine so and that's what I try and keep that 140 stuff, though under 140s.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But yeah, so the morning ones anywhere between like 90 and 120.
PATIENT: Something like that, yeah and it'll vary in there I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay and then the after meal ones anything less than like 150.
PATIENT: Oh gosh yeah, they're all down that, it's just and I don't know why, maybe you could tell me doctor.  Why is it, you know you're just laying around, you're sleeping at night and stuff and you're not eating candy bars or anything, why would it go up, I don't know.
DOCTOR: Well, so everybody whose normal has your pancreas makes a certain amount of insulin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: All day and that's the amount that you have whether you're eating, whether you're sleeping, anytime.  So normal people have this basal rate.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I mean it's a constant rate.  Up here, people with diabetes are a little bit lower so you're not; you're technically not being covered for your normal sugars during the night.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: With diabetes.
PATIENT: Cause my body is resting yeah.
DOCTOR: Right because you don't have.
PATIENT: I'm not active or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you don't have your pancreas making that insulin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So that's kind of what the medications are for either to help you make more of your own.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Or to help you be more sensitive to the amount that you are making by yourself.
PATIENT: I think what you're saying then is I'm a good boy and I'm okay.  (Laughter)
DOCTOR: Yeah I think you're doing great.  Um, we haven't checked your A1c in a while.
PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: Your, that tells me how well you're doing with your diabetes. Um, I can show it to you here so.
PATIENT: When I was here last time uh, DOCTOR she had me you know when I left her.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She had me go downstairs and they drew some blood out of me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If that's what you're talking about.
DOCTOR: Yeah so that was back in March and its good, anything below 7 or below.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Is good um and you've been right at 7, a little less previously, um for the diabetes.  So I think um.  Have you eaten anything today?
PATIENT: Yeah I had breakfast.
DOCTOR: You have eaten.
PATIENT: I had you know a small bowl of oatmeal.
DOCTOR: Cause I think we need to check your.
PATIENT: She wasn't too concerned about that.  Cause I, she asked me when the last time I saw her before she moved on.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh I said well I had breakfast this morning and she said I don't think it'll hurt anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah, if we were checking your cholesterol it would be an issue but today we don't need to check the cholesterol.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: She checked that last time.  Um, so we can get the test done today.
PATIENT: You mean stop on the way out and draw a gallon of blood.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah just a gallon.
PATIENT: (Laughter)
DOCTOR: Um, so that way I can see whether or not we need to go up on your medications.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But [REDACTED].  Let me be up frank with you, now I have a cardiologist DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I, if he tells me to jump ten times I'm gonna do it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause he's been keeping me going.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause the history of my family; I'm the first male to get past 57.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: So whatever he's doing to me.
DOCTOR: Is good.
PATIENT: Look I want to stay with him.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um, yeah and any changes that he makes, just let me know.
PATIENT: That's what I've done with DOCTOR too, any time he would change something and stuff like that; I would fax a copy to her, attention to.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah just send along the same thing.
PATIENT: Now do you have the same fax number as DOCTOR?  Okay so everything is the same.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I got it written at home then yeah.
DOCTOR: Yep, I'll [REDACTED].  So you have your eye exam.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: That was back in February.
PATIENT: Yeah she wanted to make sure to look back and I faxed her the report on that too.
DOCTOR: Good.  So you get that done outside of the VA?
PATIENT: Yes ma'am.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So same thing though whenever you have it again in February of this coming year.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Just fax the report.
PATIENT: Or if I come to see you, I'll bring it in here yeah.
DOCTOR: That would be good, either way.  Um, your cholesterol looks great; your blood pressure looks great.  Uh the only thing I wanted to check was your kidney function today um.  People with diabetes sometimes um, in their urine have a little bit of protein.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And that kind of tells us how your kidneys are doing as far as the diabetes.  Um, it hasn't been checked in a while, in a couple years.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So just to screen you and make sure you're okay.
PATIENT: Sure, I don't care, great.  No I did a urine test the last time I was here.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] This particular test.
PATIENT: Cause are we talking about peeing in the cup?
DOCTOR: Yeah that may have been um.
PATIENT: Cause they drew blood and they gave me a little paper cup to pee in.
DOCTOR: Yeah, well the only one I see is from 07.
PATIENT: Maybe that stuff was lost huh, who knows.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Maybe [REDACTED] doctor.
DOCTOR: I hope not.  Um, yeah I think, I mean it's a painless test.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: So um.  We can do that today and check the A1c and I think as far as everything else goes, we can keep doing what we're doing.
PATIENT: Great.  Love to hear that, doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright.  And you've had a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: I had one about a year ago, two years ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Let's see when that was.
PATIENT: Hey did you increase my lisinopril or refill it so I can get more of that?  Cause they said when I called uh, they said that it's been.
DOCTOR: That it was expired.
PATIENT: Expired, big word I couldn't think of that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um.
PATIENT: Do you want this blood work from here?  This is from.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.  Where is this from?
PATIENT: That's from Afinity; in fact it's my wife's doctor.  Nice lady.
DOCTOR: And this was.
PATIENT: This was a while back.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah okay.
PATIENT: And that was because I had this before and then.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT:
DOCTOR: something and then uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Then DOCTOR or something like that.
DOCTOR: DOCTOR.
PATIENT: DOCTOR, he wanted me to come in and then he cancelled on me and then you got stuck with me (laughter).
DOCTOR: No I'm not stuck.  Um, so this um, the hemoglobin A1c what we were talking about.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Is 7.4 here, so that's a little, that's worse than the one that we drew.
PATIENT: Oh, okay.
DOCTOR: Back in March, but I think at that point the metformin was increased to 500 twice a day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Which is what you're taking now.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So now today, this will be even more meaningful, that way I can see how much better you are.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: From that.
PATIENT: I'm here hon.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm easy; I'll do whatever you tell me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You doctors are keeping me going.
DOCTOR: (Laughter).  Okay.
PATIENT: Now the colonoscopy, I will have that done over at uh the gastrologist's in Arlington Heights.
DOCTOR: Okay and you won't need another one for ten years.
PATIENT: No, they found a polyp.  They sent me a letter, a card and they wanted it done next year cause then that would be two years or three years or something.
DOCTOR: Oh so they want you to have another one?
PATIENT: I don't want to do it but.
DOCTOR: Okay so this says benign polyps.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: But I guess not.
PATIENT: I really don't want to, that's, of course that's something.
DOCTOR: You don't happen to have the report do you?
PATIENT: Uh you should have a copy of it, not you but I mean your computer should.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  I'll have to check and see, I don't see it.
PATIENT: If not I can go back to Gastrology and get it and then.
DOCTOR: Yeah, just probably fax me.
PATIENT: I'd better write that, you're not going to keep this paper here then?
DOCTOR: Uh, if it's mine for the keeping I'll keep it.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, you keep that.  Can I borrow one of your pens?
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Cause then I can write my love notes to myself.
DOCTOR: (Laughter).  (Doctor using keyboard, entering data).

PATIENT: God I hate to tell you this I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Cause the.
PATIENT: If I got it, I would've got it here.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um.  According to this you haven't had one in ten years and they need to be repeated every ten years.
PATIENT: Okay.

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I used to be able to walk the tracks, walk the track at the Rex Plex but uh now maybe I'll do one lap and then go on the machines and I work my upper body more, more so than.
DOCTOR: Is this because of shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Right.  I have an exercycle, I got an Aerodyne at home and I have a treadmill but I'm more comfortable on the Aerodyne cause my feet don't hurt on that.

DOCTOR: Yeah.  Sometimes that can go with diabetes; it gives you a full feeling.
