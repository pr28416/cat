DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: PATIENT.
DOCTOR: Hi I'm DOCTOR.  You can set this here, over here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] you had.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] talk to me and [REDACTED] everything else I need.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Are there any specific issues or questions that you have?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yes.  Uh I'm out of a lot of this.
DOCTOR: Okay I can renew them.
PATIENT: Uh this one, this one they gave me for my pain.
DOCTOR: Pain.
PATIENT: It's, I'm running out of that, I'm done cause I've been doubling and tripling them and stuff I take a lot of them so I'm out of those now.
DOCTOR: Oh where do you have pain?
PATIENT: Uh my left hip.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Arthritis in my knee.
DOCTOR: Okay have you tried anything else like physical therapy?
PATIENT: Well um, I just got to the point where I'm lighter now where I can do it.  Before I was 350 pounds and it's like running around and stuff like that you know.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And then when summer kicks I'm going to be gone on my bike, I take off so when summer comes I'm gone.
DOCTOR: Okay um so you have this arthritis in your hips.
PATIENT: And I got my knee.  I had back surgery and I had, I guess I aggravated my sciatic nerve.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But my foot's like numb.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know it doesn't have as much feeling as this one.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But it has a little feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright and every once in a while that sciatic nerve hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That I think, the arthritis and that, I think that's why they gave it to me, I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I see.  Um so I just letting you know that tramadol is kind of addicting and I don't want you to take it for too long.  That's the only thing, that's why I want you to go to Physical Therapy to see if they can do injections there.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: To see if that will go away and is the tramadol helping you?
PATIENT: I don't think so.  I mean it lightens the pain a little bit but.
DOCTOR: I think you need something else that might be a little bit better and long-acting.
PATIENT: That would be nice.
DOCTOR: Like meloxicam, it's an NSAID, it's an anti-inflammatory drug.  Um it works on a different part of the pain system um and I can try to give you that and see how that goes and if that doesn't help you call me and then we can change it again.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So let's try that because arthritis is inflammation.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Um and so we'll try to give you some meloxicam and see if that makes it better.
PATIENT: /alright.
DOCTOR: Um so you take ibuprofen and does that work?
PATIENT: Uh they just gave me that when I had my ear infection.
DOCTOR: Oh you don't need to take this, you don't take this?
PATIENT: I don't take that anyway.
DOCTOR: Oh so, you don't take it.
PATIENT: And I had an ear infection.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I was here and I went down to the Ear and Throat, you know down there okay.  They said okay you look okay.  Next week it came back with a vengeance.
DOCTOR: Oh really, so it started coming back?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I got another appointment with them today.
DOCTOR: Oh the ENT doctors.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay so you're going to follow up with them?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Why do you have so many recurrent ear infections?
PATIENT: Yeah that's what I'd like to know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now my daughter read that I could be allergic to milk or something, have allergies.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Have allergies.
DOCTOR: Not in your ears, it makes you have diarrhea but not ears.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Not your ears okay, so.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: So besides the arthritis and the knee pain um and the ear infection.
PATIENT: Back pain.
DOCTOR: You have back pain?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um but you never went to Physical Therapy?
PATIENT: Uh I had it when I had my back surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I think it’s a good idea, yeah so because what we do is first we control the pain but if that doesn't work we always recommend physical therapy.  Sometimes that can actually help a lot.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And if that doesn't work then you think of surgery and you think of other options.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So I want you to go through that level and if it doesn't get you to where you want it to be then we'll talk about something else.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and then you got your labs done today which was great.  Your cholesterol is excellent.

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Um and I just quit.  I don't like ibuprofen.  I know what they did to the guys that did them in Arizona and they would go on dialysis just because of that you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I don't take ibuprofen, I don't like it.
DOCTOR: Yeah so that's why.  So how long did you take the ibuprofen for, just recently?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Well I took the, let's see the earache went away yesterday.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: Not any more yeah that's true.  [REDACTED].  So let's see Levitra.
PATIENT: I do have shortness of breath.  I mean.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know.  I'm gonna have to figure that out.  Maybe you're going to need to get pulmonary function tests to categorize why you have the shortness of breath.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um and the wheezing only happened at night?  Did it wake you up at night?
PATIENT: When I lay down.  When I'm laying down yeah.

DOCTOR: Oh, so that's why you're here.  You're with me since she left.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, got it, got it, got it.  Okay so let's see what else we can do.  Now I see, she gave you vardenafil which is, let's just see the medication.  Okay so she gave you Levitra like you had said, [REDACTED] that way.  So 10 mg and then you used the 20 mg and it didn't help.  That's both of them?
PATIENT: The half one didn't.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Um the whole one, I don't really remember.
DOCTOR: You don't remember if it was?
PATIENT: That was a long time ago and I don't have a real good, I don't know.  She just asked me to find out something about it.
DOCTOR: Do you want to try that one again or not?
PATIENT: Um it doesn't matter.  I could try it again and if it does work well then that's great I mean.
DOCTOR: Once you may be getting one because it didn't stay up right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you're able to penetrate okay?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But then it lasted only like 2 minutes?
PATIENT: Right.

DOCTOR: So if the sleep study, they said at the bottom, they didn't tell you to take it again?
PATIENT: I don't remember.
DOCTOR: So you got it done in September 2010 and.
PATIENT: I just wake up all the time at night to go to the bathroom because I have to go to the bathroom all the time you know.  I go to the bathroom a lot you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So they told us to repeat the sleep study in a few months so I might want to do it again for you.  Are you okay with that?

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Where I used to get it, I know right where it's at because [REDACTED].  My left foot, I got I don't know maybe, you know how you stub your toe and it really hurts.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well if I stub any one of these toes, it don't hurt at all.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean when I hit something and stub it you know and I know I kicked it I says oh, okay, that's happened I don't have to worry about it cause it don't hurt.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But if I do it with my right foot, then I'm hopping.
DOCTOR: I'm going to have you continue with the tramadol, the one that you have.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Only because, I'm kind of afraid to put you on another medication because you have that kidney, that creatinine level bumped up. I am going to have you check your creatinine level in like maybe a week.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: We’ll see where it is.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And if it goes down we'll have to put you on something else.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And we'll try to figure it out that way.  And you need to lose weight and I know you have been right?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Um are you in the MOVE Program at all?
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: The MOVE Program.
PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: Oh you don't know about the MOVE Program?  It's this program that's for anyone that's interested in losing weight.  There's this program that is tailored to the individual and you get to work out and eat the way that they would like you too and it's pretty impressive what they do there.
PATIENT: They feed you?
DOCTOR: I don't know if they feed you, they kind of give you advice on how to go about what you should eat.
PATIENT: Cause a lot of time I'm cooking for myself so I eat a lot of yogurt um, I eat a lot of lunch meat.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I eat a lot of oatmeal.

DOCTOR: But do you workout?
PATIENT: Um no but I ride my motor, I guess I you know I lift my motorcycle tires when I'm changing them and stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well I think you should definitely do the MOVE Program though.  I think that might be a good way of like trying to lose weight.  I know you're doing the losing weight on your own.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think you would benefit.  They way, your knee pain, your back pain, all that will go away on its own.
PATIENT: Yeah my, my back doesn't hurt as much as it used to.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I can walk straighter.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I'm still out of breath a lot.  So I won't get up and walk a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just cause after a little while of walking I start limping.
DOCTOR: So do you want to be part of the MOVE Program?
PATIENT: I don't know if I really have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have a lot of responsibilities with the club and stuff like that and they keep me pretty busy.
DOCTOR: What club?
PATIENT: The SEAGULLs.  Motorcycle Club.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I've got everything down.  We talked about that.  So tell me about the shortness of breath.  So um what's going on?  When do you get short of breath?
PATIENT: Walking.
DOCTOR: Walking?  How much do you walk until you get short of breath?
PATIENT: Um from here to out of the building where the valet parking is.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'm wheezing pretty good by then.
DOCTOR: You're wheezing.
PATIENT: I'm pretty short of breath.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And how many blocks can you walk?
PATIENT: Well it used to be not even a half a block and I would be, so I'm walking further now.
DOCTOR: Oh you are?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Since you lost weight.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you're walking farther since you lost weight.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you used to walk like maybe half a block and now you're walking at least a block?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I can walk over a block.  I think that's over a block.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And sometimes it's better than others.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I went to the bike show and I walked through that whole thing, I didn't.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I hardly hurt at all but other times it's walking half a mile to get in the place and I was really hobbling you know, it's like and my hip really, really, really hurt you know.  Okay so it seemed like maybe, my knee maybe it is getting better now.
DOCTOR: So um is it the pain that makes you stop or is it the shortness of breath that makes you stop walking?
PATIENT: Pain.
DOCTOR: So you can walk farther if you didn't have pain?
PATIENT: Probably.
DOCTOR: It's not the shortness of breath that's preventing you from walking.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay so when do you get short of breath?  Do you ever get short of breath or is it just the pain that limits you?
PATIENT: Um, I'll make a mental note of this.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright so if you're not huffing and puffing then that means it's not the shortness of breath that limits you.
PATIENT: Well I'm always, I'm always, always I don't know.  I'll write this down.
DOCTOR: Alright.  But I'll send you in for a pulmonary function test.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh but you do notice wheezing when you're walking?
PATIENT: Yeah.
