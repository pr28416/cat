DOCTOR: OK, and how much sputum are you producing each day? Some, sometimes it's useful to think about like teaspoons or tablespoons.
PATIENT: I would say every time I cough like a teaspoon I probably have like. I don't know. Maybe 5 to 10 teaspoons a day.
DOCTOR: Uh OK, and is there any particular time of day that the cough is worse?

DOCTOR: Oh OK, um I. So I mean anybody in the family have cancers?
PATIENT: Um no, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright um so, that that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on history. Was there any, uh, any other questions that you had?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just wanted to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: OK for sure so um we will run some investigations and likely get a chest X Ray because it's been a couple of months that these symptoms have been going on for. But I think it could be related to your smoking and most likely um Bronc, chronic bronchitis, but we can definitely will be looking into this, and then also with possibly some pulmonary function tests as well.
PATIENT: OK, sounds good.
