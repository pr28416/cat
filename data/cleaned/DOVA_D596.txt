PATIENT: Who is that with, with NAME?  March 26th?

DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright let me ask you a few questions okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh your sugars, any low sugars?  What's the lowest your sugar's been?
PATIENT: 90 something.
DOCTOR: Perfect.  Alright cause I don't, like even [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don't want to go down lower cause, eat something to bring it back up or [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Perfect. Um I don't want like anything lower than 80 something okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um what's the highest your sugar's been.
PATIENT: The highest since I been taking these medication, uh close to 300.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: No 200, 200 and that's when I first started.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's been under 200.
DOCTOR: Oh that's pretty good.
PATIENT: It's been under 200.
DOCTOR: Pretty good.
PATIENT: Now there's some days that it might go up a little, over 200 or something like that but.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The majority is under 200.
DOCTOR: Wow that's excellent.
PATIENT: Yeah I see a difference too.
DOCTOR: Better energy.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Not peeing so much.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Good I'm glad.
PATIENT: At nighttime too I.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It used to be three, four times, now it's a couple you know.
DOCTOR: And when your sugars are that high it's what we call [REDACTED] to make you pee basically.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Sugar pools in your urine and then it makes a lot more urine basically.
PATIENT: She was telling me that the metformin, she gave me the metformin 1000.
DOCTOR: Twice a day.
PATIENT: Twice a day right.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because if I do work, if I work out with it that is going to go to the bone right?
DOCTOR: No exactly.
PATIENT: Or it's good for bones or what's the reason behind the fact that I got to go out and walk around and you know like do four or five blocks and everything like that?
DOCTOR: Well exercise by itself will help you lower your sugars.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But uh it might help what we call, so metformin is what we call a sensitizer.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It makes your body more receptive to the insulin that you're earlier.
PATIENT: Oh gotcha okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah so um so if you take metformin and you work out and it basically helps your body absorb the sugar in your blood, it goes to the muscle, everywhere else, supports the liver and things like that.  So instead of hanging in around your blood, which is bad, it goes to where it should go basically like the liver.
PATIENT: So a good workout would be, consist of what, sitting up, standing up, walking around, two blocks, three blocks, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Good question.
PATIENT: Running, uh going around the block one time or what?  So before I take the pill, after I take the pill or?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: What way works better?
DOCTOR: Uh it doesn't matter.  The idea for exercise is consistency and duration.  Um it doesn't matter what you do but the idea is to raise your heart rate for at least 30 minutes a day.
PATIENT: Consistently.
DOCTOR: Consistently.  Uh but it doesn't have to be [REDACTED] day.
PATIENT: That would be what, that would how?
DOCTOR: If you like to swim, if you like to walk really fast.
PATIENT: I'll be doing it; I just finished taking a course on swimming.
DOCTOR: Great.
PATIENT: Okay, learning how to swim.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I'm going to college over at [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Great.
PATIENT: And I took a class and then now for some reason they shut it down for the semester.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Cause of safety hazard.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Some reason, something to do with safety.
DOCTOR: Any aerobic activity, swimming, walking really fast, treadmills, Stairmasters, elliptical machines, things like that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: This will help bring up your heart rate, help you burn some calories and work on your muscles.  Cause muscles, when you work on them, they get stronger and then they give you use energy which is good.
PATIENT: That's good.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly so the glucose that's hanging around in your blood gets burned off by your muscles.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I'm glad you asked me about that um otherwise I'm going to continue things, except for increasing the blood pressure medication, I'm going to continue.  Tell you what; do you have a good phone number I could reach you at?
PATIENT: Yeah.  My wife's.
DOCTOR: Oh she'll get on your case then.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: NUMBER.
DOCTOR: NUMBER.
PATIENT: Right call any time.

PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But.
PATIENT: Why?
DOCTOR: So I mean, you're clearly heading in the right direction and I'm very encouraged by it.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Um you're last; we'll see what the A1c is today.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Whenever we get your blood tests results and we'll talk about that.

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: To sooth it or something like that.  I need something that's going to go on ahead and cut it out, am I sick, do I have a cold or what, what is it?
DOCTOR: Well let’s gonna talk about that.  Um like how many times do you cough like that in a day?
PATIENT: A day?  About three or four times.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh when you cough to you bring anything up?
PATIENT: Yeah it's like uh, it's something I feel in my throat come up and then it's like a glob but it's clear.

PATIENT: Irritating you know what I mean in class and there are a couple of other people with a cough you know but it got, I don't know, maybe they got the same thing but uh I need to curtail it so that way I could put more.
DOCTOR: Do you get a tickling sensation in your throat before you cough or?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: So I'll give you some lozenges as well.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then um you can, like when you're in class you can.
PATIENT: Take them.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you can take them a little prophylactically.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So when you feel like it's a bad day or something like that.
PATIENT: I can feel it coming cause it starts tickling you know and I'm like trying to hold it, try not to cough.  So I buy a bottle and not a cold bottle of water just regular temperature.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I soothe the throat and then I'll cough a little bit and it'll go away.  But it happens like twice, twice in a class period that I'm in.
