DOCTOR: 17.
PATIENT: Or 217 yeah.
DOCTOR: Good job, good job.
PATIENT: I feel a little bit better when I put on just a little bit more weight.  I don't know why cause I like to walk a lot and I don't want to get.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I don't want some wind to come by and blow me away.  But normally I've never had that.
DOCTOR: Are you still smoking?
PATIENT: I'm down to five cigarettes a day now and it's getting to the point, I was smoking ten.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You know what.
PATIENT: Now the last time I smoked.  The last time I smoked a cigarette was 7 o'clock this morning and I feel good.  I take a couple shots of albuterol.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: To help me breathe a little bit easier.  I don't know what it is; the climate up there in Chicago is a lot different than where I live at.
DOCTOR: Okay you know um.
PATIENT: Cause they got a lot of factories around there.
DOCTOR: You know why we were concerned because you shouldn't be smoking at all.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: You shouldn't be smoking at all.
PATIENT: You know what, I wake up in the morning and I drink a cup of coffee.
DOCTOR: Cause you're very lucky, we found the lung cancer early enough.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They were able to do surgery on it.
PATIENT: Okay now, let me tell you something.
DOCTOR: If you keep smoking it's gonna happen again.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to go through that again.  I want to live at least another 2 1/2, 3 years.  See I have this book that comes out you know, selling through this publication in Oregon.  When I was out there to visit my brother I went to go see, I talked to an agent.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh but anyway that kind of relieves my stress level and worrying about my pain and the condition I'm in.
DOCTOR: If you’re stressed you can you know.
PATIENT: They were gonna send me over; I went over to see the cardiologist.  I think it was the 19th.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or maybe it was the 16th.
DOCTOR: You saw the cardiologist.
PATIENT: That was the [REDACTED][REDACTED][REDACTED][REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You did see them.
PATIENT: Okay they said they were gonna set up a surgeon to call me the following week which was the 19th to the 24th and to schedule a meeting or appointment to see a surgeon general up there.  They didn't say a doctor's name.  They said they found, the cardiologist here at the Jesse Brown Medical Center, they said they found a white sac in the center of my heart and it's very hard.  Now if it was cancer you would think it would be black right?
DOCTOR: It's a fluid collection.
PATIENT: But I was coughing a lot.  I had a cold at that time and I told them I says maybe that was the build-up from being, me having a cold.  Now I went to them and picked up the pain medication and they uh, also DOCTOR in Chicago Heights, she's very courteous, very nice, she prescribed me a face mask for the cold weather that we're gonna be experiencing for the next seven or eight weeks or nine weeks.  They said it was gonna be a very mild winter but I believe that like the Cubs are gonna win the World Series right.  Uh I think it's gonna be a lot colder.  But anyway I see the cardiologist here in two days.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they were supposed to set up an appointment, like I said again, that they were gonna you know schedule appointment at the Hines Hospital.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I know how to get there now.
DOCTOR: So did you [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: They never contacted me.
DOCTOR: Really?
PATIENT: So this is what I'm gonna tell them Friday I'm gonna tell the you know don't call me up here once a week or twice a week cause I hate that commute.  That's very, very stressful.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause I gotta watch my back most of the time and a lot of game bangers out by the bus terminal while I lived in the Heights and I probably told you that [REDACTED] once before.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I'm kind of worried about that so I been seeing doctors down at Chicago Heights and uh now I found out that uh I can't see them anymore because I got the Aetna Better Health Insurance through Medicaid.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The Welfare Department at Blue Island and they says the doctors won't accept it no more but I was seeing this doctor up there on my back muscle.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He was working it back in.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And for two days I felt great, like normal you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then it popped out again and this feels like I'm grinding against my shoulder blade it goes down.  I don't know, what's that called, something like deviates something like that but the bone that goes in your shoulder down to your ribs.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And also I found out he told me after they took like ten x-rays they said that they took part of your muscle out in your back.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And part of your rib to get to your lung.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they didn't tell me that you know when I came to in ICU.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Ten hours after operation.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay.
PATIENT: So that's probably why the muscle would not work back up.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Alright so.
PATIENT: It's probably gonna be like that the rest of my life.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Plus the doctor in the Heights, I don't think she had any uh really clearance to say it but she says go up there and file for pension.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now I know and you know and people that have filed for a pension because I feel like the doctors, when they turn me on my side real quick, that's when the muscle dropped.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it hasn't worked itself back up yet.
DOCTOR: Have you had physical therapy?
PATIENT: No I was getting physical therapy by DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Why don't we try physical therapy here?
PATIENT: Huh.
DOCTOR: And I'm glad to give you [REDACTED] pain patches [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well he's a pain specialist and he's one of the best they got here in Illinois okay.
DOCTOR: Alright yeah.
PATIENT: That's why I went to go see him.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: But I wondered if I could pick up some Lidoderm patches.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Which will help me a lot because it helps me with my movement in my middle lateral section and some Absorbase that's right over here.  That's for dry skin and I'm running out and I take a shower twice a day and I put that on because I'm starting to itch and I'm running low so I only use it three, four times a week.  But when I don't apply it, it's a topical cream so to speak and it's, I don't feel like itching my legs.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Now I got a vein that goes.
DOCTOR: How did you find this doctor?
PATIENT: He was referred to me by uh DOCTOR and DOCTOR was referred to me by uh a doctor over would accept Aetna Better Health.
DOCTOR: Okay it was through your insurance.
PATIENT: And my insurance yeah.  Another rag head.
DOCTOR: Okay so this is not VA then?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: This not VA doctors?
PATIENT: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: His name is on the back here.
DOCTOR: Okay cause right now I think you're.
PATIENT: I know, I know.
DOCTOR: You probably have too many doctors.
PATIENT: You probably feel that.
DOCTOR: It's gotten confusing.
PATIENT: Now I can't see him no more.
DOCTOR: Okay you can't see them anymore.
PATIENT: And I called the Aetna Better Health.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  But it’s okay you can still come here and.
PATIENT: Cause so can I get the patches today?
DOCTOR: Uh let me ask DOCTOR okay.
PATIENT: Okay and then uh if you can get approval for that, I'm sorry, uh and have them maybe ship them out to my address once a month.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The only reason.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] you're on hydrocodone, do you have enough of that?
PATIENT: Well I ran out four or five days ago and I've been in extreme pain.
DOCTOR: Okay you ran out of that.
PATIENT: I been taking ibuprofen but that's nothing, it's like taking an aspirin.
DOCTOR: I'll make sure you have enough of that, alright.  Your blood pressure's a little high today.
PATIENT: But DOCTOR at Chicago Heights ordered 120 doses.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Every two weeks.  Now the pharmacist over here says it would be for 20 days because I don't want you to take more than six a day so six times ten is 60 and ten times, six times ten is 60 again so that's 20 days.
DOCTOR: The new dose is.
PATIENT: And I eat a lot when I take this medication because it tends to make me nauseous if I don't.  And I don't like to drink milk too much cause it stops me up, plugs me up so to speak.  And I take my Docusate which is a stool softener.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Okay.  Alright so what did Oncology say, let’s see?
PATIENT: Okay now the doctor in Chicago Heights wants me to make an appointment for Oncology Department.
DOCTOR: Oncology.  You saw them here.
PATIENT: Oh that was the cardiologist.  Is that the same thing?
DOCTOR: No.  You also saw Oncology in November alright.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So the good news is.
PATIENT: It didn't spread.
DOCTOR: Yet.  But then.
PATIENT: Because they did a CAT scan.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And they told me yeah.
DOCTOR: But then um there's that fluid collection that you mentioned.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you know what that is? [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Could they take a CAT scan today or tomorrow or Friday?
DOCTOR: No they already took a CAT scan, it's already [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I mean.
DOCTOR: You just need to see the surgeons.  You know the most important thing right now going on?
PATIENT: Who?
DOCTOR: You know the most important thing right now?  What do you think it is?
PATIENT: Smoking.
DOCTOR: Yes.  I'm very, very concerned.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I believe you.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like you need gums or lozenges?
PATIENT: What the lozenges?
DOCTOR: Like candies or gums, nicotine gums.
PATIENT: The gum helps me.
DOCTOR: You have that on there?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I got uh a couple of boxes at the house.
DOCTOR: Well when do you feel anxious?
PATIENT: When I.
DOCTOR: What if we give you like medicine for anxiety so that you could take that instead of smoking?
PATIENT: That might help me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Cause I.
PATIENT: Other than the Xanax.
DOCTOR: I'm so concerned that you're still smoking.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Well I'm not smoking that much anymore now.
DOCTOR: No it doesn't matter.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter.
PATIENT: Right.  One cigarette is worse than.

DOCTOR: Definitely.  So um you've gone through a lot right now but I don't want you to go through this again alright.
PATIENT: Okay [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's really serious.
PATIENT: Is there any possible way that I could transfer out to Portland, Oregon?
DOCTOR: You want to move there?
PATIENT: Like April 1st or at least by May 1st.
DOCTOR: Are you planning to move there?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I mean that's possible [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Cause the weather over there, it rains a lot but that's good for me though.
DOCTOR: Okay well it's up to you.
PATIENT: There's more condensation.
DOCTOR: It's up to you if you want to live in Oregon.
PATIENT: I figured if I pass away I'll be around my brother.
DOCTOR: Yeah and they have VAs over there you know.
PATIENT: And you know last time I went in the [REDACTED] I mean conditional fit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I thought you know.
DOCTOR: So when do you think you're gonna move if you ever?
PATIENT: Well if I can get a clearance from the cardiologist or the surgeon over at Hines Hospital to move out there and then register with the VA Hospital in Portland, Oregon.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: But pretty soon.
PATIENT: If worst come to worse they'll probably have to use a laser to cut that center of that white sac out.
DOCTOR: Right.  So I mean.
PATIENT: And I'm not afraid of the surgery.
DOCTOR: Do you want to complete your, do that here and then move to Oregon or do you want it at that location?
PATIENT: It's gonna take about six months here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh but you wanted to get that done in Oregon.

(DOCTOR OUT:  43:12  DOCTOR IN:  63:24)
DOCTOR: No that's fine.
PATIENT: I'm just talking to myself that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So um we don't have the patches here but we have the ointment.

DOCTOR: And you're not overdosing yourself.
PATIENT: Okay so it's not a thin coating it's enough to.
DOCTOR: You just put a very thin coat.
PATIENT: Okay a thin coat.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I was doing that with the other medicated cream and it was burning my back for days.
DOCTOR: Oh the capsaicin.
PATIENT: Oh that was burning me too much.
DOCTOR: Okay we'll stop that then.  It wasn't helping with the pain at all?
PATIENT: No, it was just burning me.  I couldn't sleep at night and I couldn't uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Move around.  They said well after you take it for a week it'd be alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I don't want to be in pain for, on fire so to speak, for a week.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  And then you know we're gonna stop the Vicodin, the hydrocodone and then we're gonna start you on something stronger okay.  So I want you to see, I want you to come back in a month to get a refill on that.
PATIENT: For what?
DOCTOR: Morphine alright.
PATIENT: I think I know what you're talking about.
DOCTOR: Take it twice a day and it's much stronger than, so I'll renew the Vicodin, you can still take the Vicodin as needed.

DOCTOR: Okay, why don't you go, why don't you go get your travel pay?
PATIENT: That's gonna be a long time but that's alright.
DOCTOR: Yeah alright.
PATIENT: Cause I think I'm gonna call up that cardiologist department tomorrow and say I can't make it up there.
DOCTOR: Okay and what we need to do is um get a repeat CT scan cause uh the CT Surgery at Hines that they wanted another CT scan before they see you.
PATIENT: They wanted what?
DOCTOR: The CT Surgery at Hines, they wanted another CT scan before they see you okay, so let's do that okay.

PATIENT: Take the Xanax.
DOCTOR: Yeah cause I want you to completely stop smoking alright.
PATIENT: Okay.  I promise you.  As a matter of fact I'll throw them away as soon as I get outside, maybe give them to someone else who wants to smoke.
DOCTOR: Just throw them away, don't let anyone else smoke either.
PATIENT: Yeah I might as well, as soon as I get home I'll get rid of all the ashtrays and I got two lighters.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They cut my TV out yesterday, my cable so I got to get cable from a different company I kind of.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Like to watch news in the morning, it kind of relaxes me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But you know what they say nowadays, no news is good news.
DOCTOR: That's true.  I feel like when I watch the news it's kind of disgusting sometimes.
PATIENT: And there's more fun when it comes to a conclusion.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Than to justify it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So you're gonna get that CT yeah.
PATIENT: And uh this thing this coach the Green Bay Packers 25 years they quoted, winning isn't everything but the win is.  Everyone must sit and watch the leaves turn.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Sure it makes sense [REDACTED].
PATIENT: As you get older you got more time to sit and I know these travel people over here, they're a joke.  I called up a person a couple hours ago.  They gave me a number and that's been almost a month now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm living on a very, very low income.  They're only giving me so much money and they have my rent $50 a month so that's kind of, what'd you lose?
DOCTOR: My pen.
PATIENT: Your pen.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Maybe you left it in DOCTOR's office.

DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's good though, I talk too much anyway.
DOCTOR: That's okay I'll see you back in a month.
PATIENT: I chew that nicotine gum too that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: And I walk a lot and that helps because I don't want to stop and light up you know and then continue to walk cause that's not good either.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me see how much Lidoderm.
PATIENT: It was 30 patches a month and uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: They only gave me one box because the price of one box is $253 and I can see why the government won't give it to me now and now I know.  Maybe when I get out to Portland, Oregon I can see about getting some.  I don't think my back's gonna get any better than what it is.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  So I'm gonna give you 60 tablets.  You should get it like at 9:00 a.m. in the morning and 9:00 p.m. in the evening okay and I'll refill the Vicodin so if you still have pain you can take that.  But don't take more than four pills a day.
PATIENT: Of the new medication you want to prescribe me or what?
DOCTOR: No, no.  The new medication you just take it two times a day.

PATIENT: Yeah mail them.  I'm not allergic to anything.  The only thing I'm allergic to is metal.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh nickel.  I was working in a metal plate factory like 40 years ago in Portland, Oregon.  I developed a rash on my stomach and it spread and then once, like a month later after it cleared up if I wore a chain or a thing I mean a ring on my finger or the belt buckle against the skin of my stomach I'd break out instantly.  That's scary.
DOCTOR: Twice a day okay and then Vicodin, do you still have it at home?  The hydrocodone?
PATIENT: Yeah for uh, do you want me to take that after a month, take this after a month or what?
DOCTOR: Take it now yeah.  Start taking that now.
