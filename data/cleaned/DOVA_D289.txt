DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: It's like it sends my system into shock or something.
DOCTOR: Sure.  Okay um.
PATIENT: Which I think is good.  With everyone having problems with drugs, I've known better than to even try it though.  It's, I guess that's been a good thing.
DOCTOR: I think it is.  You finished your antibiotics um.  Your diabetes numbers actually look okay.  Kidneys look, your kidney numbers look a little high.  Were you not eating or drinking so well?  You know when you first had gone to the Emergency Room?
PATIENT: I probably wasn't drinking that much.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Yeah.  (Doctor answers a page) Sorry, last time, um so it looks like your cholesterol's a little high.  I think uh you know we could try to control that with diet and exercise but um.
PATIENT: I've been eating too much [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But you know it's uh, it's something to you know think about if um you know, get you started with some medication, once daily that you would take at nighttime that would help bring your cholesterol down.  You don't have any liver disease which is good.  Um and I think let's see, these are your last numbers looked good alright and you had an eye exam right in January.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, I got glasses.
DOCTOR: Let me take a quick listen to you.  Take a deep breath.  Take one more time. Very good. Breathe normally, just regular breathing.  And this isn’t painful at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  Okay.  You haven't noticed a bunch of swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: No.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Take off your glasses for one second and look straight ahead at me.  Say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Good.  Now do you have a tooth that's been hurting?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I’ve got one, it was uh, it had a ceramic filling.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it came out.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I'm scheduled for; I think it's June 2nd.
DOCTOR: Dental appointment okay.  Um we should maybe give you like a topical or something that would help the pain.  You know like an Orajel like a cream or something.
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: That might help.
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: Swallow, no lumps or bumps anywhere?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Um I'm gonna run this by DOCTOR who is my attending and we'll see what we can do for you.  But um, when do you think the last time you took your blood pressure medicine was?
PATIENT: Uh probably, that was on the 8th, about the 4th.
DOCTOR: The 4th okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] okay and your diabetes [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
(DOCTOR OUT:  21:32  DOCTOR IN:  27:10)
DOCTOR: Alright sir, okay.  So um okay um a couple of things we're gonna do.  We're gonna start you back on your home meds okay on the diabetes stuff and for the blood pressure.
PATIENT: Those, I’ve already got.
DOCTOR: Right.  So go ahead and start taking them because your blood pressure is still too high so we need you to come in two weeks for your blood pressure check.  You don't have to see me, you can just see the nurse and they can check it really quick and uh you know uh let us know.  At that time, you know if we want to then change your medications but there's sort of no point if you haven't taken it for a while.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: We don't even know if what you're taking is working.  Um there are a couple other things, let's see, okay.  So we're doing this, we need your blood pressure; we'll get you a tetanus shot.  That's just the one that when you like brush up against metal or something like that, like rusty metal you can get tetanus from that so it's a shot you get once every ten years, it's uh and yeah that is not bad.
PATIENT: No side effects?
DOCTOR: No usually it's just the arm soreness.  And many times there's actually, you know they would prefer [REDACTED].  Some people find that, I'm sure you've had other vaccinations in the past at some time but it usually doesn't [REDACTED] them.  Um then um we're gonna get you an ultrasound of your abdomen.  I know they had done some pictures before but the think is that we’d like to see the part of your blood vessels where they go into your stomach because you have a history of using tobacco you're at increased risk of having what they call an aneurysm which mean that the blood vessel is big so for all men who are over 65 who have a smoking history, you know it's for pregnant women, it’s the same thing, they just put goop on your belly and it doesn't hurt.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So, I signed you up for that.  Um so um [REDACTED].  We'll get your tetanus shot.  For your tooth, I think I'm going to try some, it's a topical thing that we give, I think it's just the thing that you kind of put in your mouth and swish around like a mouthwash and you spit it out.  (Doctor makes phone call)  Okay we're gonna start you on a low dose cholesterol medication.  The fact that you're a diabetic and you have high blood pressure means you should be on a cholesterol medication and a baby aspirin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we can address that.
PATIENT: I've got I think its 8 grams or 8 mm.
DOCTOR: 81.
PATIENT: Yeah, I've got that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  And would like to pick up this medication here?  Well I guess we’ve never mailed it to you [REDACTED], so you should pick it up here right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: They could mail them; no they can mail it out.
DOCTOR: Oh does that work?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  (Doctor continues phone call) What other reaction have you had?  It has listed an allergy that you have had a reaction to anesthetics, what happens?
PATIENT: Only, the only one that really bothers me has been [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: (Doctor continues phone call) Okay I think we should be okay.
PATIENT: Yeah and the only thing that bothers me is.
DOCTOR: (Doctor continues phone call) So I think we'll just try that, it's like a mouthwash just kind of do that okay.  So um take your medications, come back in two weeks, you'll get your tetanus shot today um and then we'll [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay great.
DOCTOR: Does that sound good?  And you'll see me back in like six months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Sounds like a plan?  Um let's see.  Oh I have these to pick up here, do you want me to mail them to you or do you want to wait?
PATIENT: They can mail them.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So the shot you have to get here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The shot unfortunately, we can’t mail to you.
PATIENT: Yeah.  The um.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause.
PATIENT: The vaccination.  They'll do that today here?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I can't remember that name of that local anesthesia they gave me.
DOCTOR: That's okay.  It should be alright.  Well you know I mean it's just a mouthwash.  Just try a little bit.  If you feel weird don't take it, you know.
PATIENT: No I'll be okay.
DOCTOR: And uh I will send you with this so.  Okay.
PATIENT: Okay good.
DOCTOR: And then.
PATIENT: Okay am I free to go teach.
DOCTOR: You're free to go teach um and um we'll schedule your colonoscopy, they'll call you for that.
