DOCTOR: PATIENT?  How you been?
PATIENT: I'm okay.
DOCTOR: Just have a seat here, wherever it's most comfortable for you.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So I went ahead and refilled some of your meds, I saw that you were out of refills.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I went ahead and refilled those.  Um are you having any problems?  Are you still having problems with the urination?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Still going on?
PATIENT: Yeah they gave me uh instead of this one, but it's not on here I don't think.  For today, is that's the oxybutynin?
DOCTOR: Oxybutynin yeah, it's on this one.
PATIENT: Yeah that's that little blue one I think.  If it is that little blue twice a day yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Uh and then also the doxazosin is for the prostate.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Yeah okay it may be working and may not I don't know.  I still get up in the nighttime but it seems like I'm lasting longer in the daytime.
DOCTOR: Oh good.  Which one's the new one, the oxybutynin?
PATIENT: It looks like oxybutynin.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Is that one the little blue, the little blue pill, uh it was prescribed by the guy, the doctor downstairs, what's it used for?
DOCTOR: It's used for like bladder stuff.
PATIENT: That's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: But there was one I didn't agree with or wasn't going to use.
DOCTOR: Yeah finasteride.
PATIENT: Yeah so that one I'm not taking that at all.  I called them up and told them I'm not even you know.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: So don't renew it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh and you just saw the urologist back at the end of January, looks like everything is okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, so I go see him in six months.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you having any shortness of breath still?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Cause I think last time you were having some shortness of breath and you were using your wife's inhaler.
PATIENT: Yeah that's the, every once I had that has that, where I start to wheeze and I can't catch my breath.  That hasn't happened since before Christmas.
DOCTOR: Oh okay good. I was curious about that.
PATIENT: So that's pretty much gone now.  Uh what I did, I'm having some teeth problems.  I had a tooth pulled and a tooth filled and this was at about Christmas time so I didn't go to the dentist and I was taking aspirin every night.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I wound up with uh acid reflux.
DOCTOR: Uh, uh okay.
PATIENT: So I stopped the aspirin and then I'm taking, because of the tooth infection, hopefully that will go away, but the dentist gave me erythromycin.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  How long were on that for?
PATIENT: Oh I'm just finishing up.
DOCTOR: Oh you're finishing okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I still have another tooth to get filled or I meant to get pulled, yeah, yeah on there so I'm going to have that one before I go again so for infection.  But since I got the erythromycin and I stopped the aspirin I haven't had any acid reflux episodes.
DOCTOR: Have not had any more?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: But then I haven't had cabbage for a while either.  I will today because they're making vegetable soup.  As a matter of fact I was taking Tums and then I took that, what's that, omeprazole?
DOCTOR: Omeprazole?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Instead of taking it a nighttime I took it right after supper.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That helped.  And then.
DOCTOR: Any other problems going on besides the teeth issue?
PATIENT: Okay uh I got a 25-pound barbell that I.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That I go like this you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And when I do the way up ones then every once in a while when I get around 15 of them, I got right here, but then it goes away and only when I do that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you walk; do you ever walk for any distance?
PATIENT: I haven't been walking because the wife doesn't go to the pool anymore and so while she was in the pool I'd go take a walk.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: Have you been doing any other kind of exertion other than the weights?
PATIENT: Yeah I got uh I built a step for her.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I use it for stuff and so forth.  Two handles up here and it's about that far off the ground and I jump on and off of it.
DOCTOR: Do you ever get chest pain when you do that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Just pulse goes up to 120, no 100 about 110-120.
DOCTOR: Okay as long as you're exercising.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And as long as you're not getting chest pain.  You know when you're doing this you're probably pulled a muscle yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If it was happening at any time you were exerting yourself then it might be a little bit more worrisome.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh when I go downstairs once in a while my right knee bothers me but that's off and on, nothing no where it happens all the time, doesn't do that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Your blood pressure is a little bit low today.  Does it normally run that low?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Like in the 90s.
PATIENT: Yeah I never have a 90.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's always 100 something over 70 or something.
DOCTOR: Was it in the like 100s or one teens or 120s?
PATIENT: It's usually 110 or something like that.  Low, nothing high.
DOCTOR: I mean do you ever get lightheaded, dizzy, pass out?  Okay.  You know the lower the blood pressure the better as a rule.
PATIENT: Yeah but not too low.
DOCTOR: Yeah it can get too low so that's why we try to make sure you don't get too low.  You're not getting lightheaded, dizzy; uh you know that kind of stuff.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: I see you had some labs done at the end of January too.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I don't know if your urologist went over them with you.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Basically your kidney function looks normal.  Uh your cholesterol.
PATIENT: Wait, wait a minute.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh the cholesterol looks good.  Uh the bad cholesterol is pretty low, its 94 and we like to see that below 100.
PATIENT: So it was 94, so it's below 100.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly, so good.
PATIENT: What's the triglyceride?
DOCTOR: The triglycerides are 109 which is perfect.
PATIENT: Yeah that's getting down.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So that niacin I guess is working.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah probably um and also the simvastatin is pretty good about doing that.
PATIENT: Yeah well I been taking the simvastatin for a long time.
DOCTOR: Your triglycerides are still a little bit of a problem.
PATIENT: So they, what are the triglycerides supposed to be?
DOCTOR: Uh you know we shoot for less than 150.
PATIENT: Well then I'm good.
DOCTOR: Yeah but even if you're a little bit above 150 we don't normally do too much.
PATIENT: So the niacin is working.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And did the tests for that, pulmonary test, say anything?
DOCTOR: Uh let me see if they have already commented on it.
PATIENT: But that was done early.
DOCTOR: That was done the same day you were here right?  The same day you saw me?
PATIENT: I think so.  No it was after I saw you.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It was normal, it was completely normal.
PATIENT: It’s a good the test.
DOCTOR: You know we use that specific test uh to see if people have like emphysema or asthma, something like that and you know, it was normal.
PATIENT: What about sugar?
DOCTOR: Your sugar was normal, it was 93.  We shoot for less than 100.  Well we shoot for less than 126 really.
PATIENT: And I guess I still have my hernia.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Are you doing the MOVE Program still or?
PATIENT: I go there once a month.  I haven't been going to exercise cause I can't get the schedule in there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Can't leave my wife alone that's enough.  So far she fell eight times.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: Yeah, over a couple years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I thought that we had switched the simvastatin to rosuvastatin.
PATIENT: No I didn't get that.  Well we talked about something different I think but I still got the, I didn't get anything new.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The only thing I got new was the niacin.
DOCTOR: Yeah well I mean your cholesterol is perfect so I don't think we need to make any changes today. We’ll continue…  So you're still taking the simvastatin right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's got 0 refill, okay I'll refill that.  So you're taking the half a tablet of that right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay and you're doing the niacin and you're just taking that once a day?
PATIENT: Yeah nighttime.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay yeah, so I think we'll stick with that.  Whatever seems to be working.  I don't know if it's your diet or the medication but something.
PATIENT: Well I lost weight.
DOCTOR: Oh good.
PATIENT: That's cause she's not eating and I'm not eating so then, until she gives me her half of the hamburger, things like that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: “Do want to finish this?”
DOCTOR: Are you.
PATIENT: But she goes, she lost 40 pounds.
DOCTOR: Oh good so you guys are trying to lose weight?  Oh okay, okay.  I just want to make sure you're not dropping weight accidentally.  Alright.
PATIENT: I feel I got five more to go and then I'm gonna stop.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah I don't think, it wouldn't hurt.  It'll help your cholesterol; probably help your blood pressure.  But your blood pressure's great now yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Are you having any pain with your hernias?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: As a matter of fact when I lay in the bed and try to pick my feet up I hold the stomach.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it's not red.  I know when it's gone.
DOCTOR: You're still not wanting surgery or anything.  You're okay with them?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause nothing's happening.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: No news good news.
DOCTOR: Alright and then they checked your, they checked the PSA again in November.
PATIENT: Yeah what's that?
DOCTOR: It was 0.7 so it was.
PATIENT: Didn't I have another PSA this last blood test?
DOCTOR: Yeah that was in November.
PATIENT: No I just had a blood test in January.
DOCTOR: Oh no, no we don't check it that often.
PATIENT: Oh.  So it wasn't on that list.
DOCTOR: No it was back in November.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: It was 0.7.  The time before that was like 1.5 yeah.  The one before that was in May and it was 1.6 actually.
PATIENT: That went down then?
DOCTOR: It went down yeah.
PATIENT: Why would that be?
DOCTOR: Oh so it could be the urologists are kind of shrinking your prostate so you can kind of follow that number sometimes.  It'll tell you how big the prostate is getting so the bigger the prostate the bigger that number.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So it means your prostate's down.
PATIENT: So then I shouldn't be peeing as often.
DOCTOR: Yeah I think that was the thought of the urologists.  If we can get your prostate shrunk down a little bit you wouldn't have as much symptoms.
PATIENT: And [REDACTED] wouldn’t need that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah cause I know they had talked about that as a possibility.
PATIENT: Yeah if it ain't broke don't fix it.
DOCTOR: And your liver looks good.  We checked the liver enzymes and they look good.
PATIENT: That's because of the prostate medicine or because of the simvastatin?
DOCTOR: Uh probably just diet.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: And stuff.
PATIENT: No okay.  But one of the medications affects the liver right?
DOCTOR: Yeah so sometimes the simvastatin can but it normally affects it in a bad way.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: So it's not doing that, you're not having that kind of affect on it.  And you do sound like you're having less urinary episodes during the day.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So maybe, see it's kind of a slow process.  It takes a while to build up in your system.  And when was your last colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Years back.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED]@, so you're due this year.
PATIENT: Oh yeah?
DOCTOR: Yeah every ten years so if the last one was in [REDACTED]@ so.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: Can we get the colonoscopy and the endoscopic at the same time right?
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: This way and that way.
DOCTOR: No they usually just do the bottom.
PATIENT: No they both at that time on me.
DOCTOR: Why did they do both?
PATIENT: Because of GERD.
DOCTOR: The Barrett's.
PATIENT: Because of the what do you call it?  The acid reflux.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Yeah he did both.  Doctor said I think the doctor was, oh something [REDACTED] name too.  He said might as well do both and I said okay.  He asked me if I ever had one, nope alright.  He says we got you up here so.  I guess it.
DOCTOR: And let's see and it was normal.  Okay.  So you know I don't think that they'll want to do one in the top again um.  I would be surprised.
PATIENT: It don't bother me cause I'm out.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.  Okay.  Are you still taking an aspirin a day?
PATIENT: Yeah the 80 mg.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's in the morning.  I take the stool softener and I take a fish pill.
DOCTOR: The fish oil okay.
PATIENT: Yeah and the aspirin and vitamin.
DOCTOR: Anybody in your family ever had colon cancer that you know of?
PATIENT: No they all have heart troubles.
DOCTOR: Heart trouble.
PATIENT: And diabetes.  My mom, my brothers, my sister but their hearts seems to be [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh you don't have any prosthetic heart valves or anything like that?  I don't see you've had a heart valve replaced.  You don't have a pacemaker, no stents.  No.  You're not taking insulin.  You're not diabetic are you?
PATIENT: Right no.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: The gal in the MOVE, NAME.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She took my uh body mass thing and says it's about 50, 54%.  I don't know much about it but it's kind of high.
DOCTOR: What was the 54%?
PATIENT: My body mass.  I think I'm over the limit.
DOCTOR: Your BMI?  It shouldn't be that high.
PATIENT: Well.  I wonder did she put it on the computer, would that be in there.  Have them put it in.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Didn't write it down.  I wrote it down on the other, my weight thing that I take.  No 30 some, oh wait, they want it above 30 some percent, so I was okay, that 30 sounds I remember she said you can't have 0.  I says no, 0 would be skin and bones.  Alright 35.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So yeah the labs are great so we won't make any changes today um.  Do you ever check your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Just make sure if you're getting lightheaded or dizzy, you know.  ‘Cuz sometimes those prostate medications they've got you on can lower your blood pressure.  That doxazosin.
PATIENT: Oh, well that never happened before and I've been taking it for so many years.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah it's fine.  As long as you, and you know if you feel like you're lightheaded, dizzy and you're gonna pass out, I wouldn't take, I would off that day on the medication you know.
PATIENT: Well that's never happened so it's good.
DOCTOR: Alright you already got your flu shot back in November.
PATIENT: Yeah.  We get that every year.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm gonna take a listen to you.  Can you take this outer shirt off?  Big deep breath in and out.  Good.  Noticed any lumps or bumps in your neck or in your armpit or your groin?
PATIENT: Uh right over here and I took it as the way the dentist was yanking trying to pull, put his finger in my.
DOCTOR: Yeah I wouldn't be surprised, especially if you had an infection there too, an infected tooth or anything.  No changes in your vision or hearing recently?
PATIENT: I think like, I don't see as good, I need new glasses.  And every once in a while.
DOCTOR: Do you see the eye doctor too?
PATIENT: I have.  On this side, on the left side, every once in a while I'll get a sharp thing like something's in there but it isn't and it's always this left eye and it's always you know I thought something's in there and I rub it.
DOCTOR: And it goes away?
PATIENT: Yeah it does.  It may be dust but it's always in the left eye, not the right eye you know and any time of the day.  It doesn't make any difference.
DOCTOR: Yeah can you open up real wide?  Lift your tongue up for me, straight up.  Is that the tooth they pulled out on the left?
PATIENT: This one.
DOCTOR: Oh okay yeah I see.
PATIENT: And then they got this one to get.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But, I want to get a second opinion.  I called up the dentist over here and he says I'm not qualified.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: He said the only time is an emergency and then they charge you $300 and I said well that's more than my dentist.
DOCTOR: Can you lay back for me?  Yeah I think it only covers you like for the first three months or something.
PATIENT: One shot they says and.
DOCTOR: You have to be less than three years out of the service or something like that.
PATIENT: Yeah and what it says about.
DOCTOR: Let me check the left side.
PATIENT: If I was wounded or something like that or, anyway I didn't qualify.
DOCTOR: I think like the last time, this hernia it's alright now but if you ever notice it gets really painful or red and hot or like blue.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Purple, cold and that kind of stuff, you should probably go to the ER, Emergency Room, cause it's always a possibility.  Notice any swelling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Alright you can sit up now.  Alright.
PATIENT: Can I put my shirt on?
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Okay.  It's been a year since I had the eyes checked.
DOCTOR: Is that right?
PATIENT: I think so.
DOCTOR: Do you have an appointment with them?
PATIENT: No.  I could just make an appointment with them?
DOCTOR: Yeah if they've seen you within the past, I think two years.
PATIENT: Oh well I'll check with them then.
DOCTOR: You can just call and set up an eye exam you know to make sure that your prescription lenses are right and everything like that.  Uh let me go, let me talk with my boss real quick.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just let him know what we're doing and then uh.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll be back in about five minutes alright.
PATIENT: Alright, I have my book.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Yeah you can sit wherever is comfortable.
PATIENT: I'll just have to go.
DOCTOR: I can’t drink it when it’s real hot.
PATIENT: That's my tea is at work.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's the power of this.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Five minutes.
(DOCTOR OUT:  48:00  DOCTOR IN:  54:35)
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds good.  I went ahead and refilled your medications.  Oh I put in an order for a colonoscopy.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Your pen.
DOCTOR: From my pocket. Uh when you come back to see me in six months you can just get the labs then and we'll wait.  We'll wait and put the order in then.
PATIENT: Order in then.
DOCTOR: Instead of you have them you know getting your blood drawn today and six months, let’s just do it all at one time alright.
PATIENT: You mean I get them to draw blood the day I come to see you?
DOCTOR: Well.
PATIENT: Or a week before?
DOCTOR: A week before.
PATIENT: A week before yeah.
DOCTOR: Yes.  It's usually I'll leave it up to the patient, whatever is most convenient for them.
PATIENT: A week before then that way, that's on there.
DOCTOR: It worked well for me.  Alright.  Anything else?
PATIENT: I think we got it covered.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm pleased that the cholesterol took a nice jump forward.  It was good.  It sounds like the prostate, the PSA is going down too so, you know I think we're making strides across the board.  Alright then, we'll plan on six months then and we'll set up your, we'll set up your colonoscopy at that time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Alright.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's good to see you.
PATIENT: Same here I guess.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Looking good.  Just across the hallway here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: See you in six months.
PATIENT: 56:48
