DOCTOR: What brings you in here today?
PATIENT: Hey, I just, um, I just kind of came in to talk about my stuffy nose. It's yeah, it's been a problem for, I don't even know how many years it's always been there. And now that school is a little less busy and things are virtual and have more time, I decided I'll get something done, um, to get it fixed.
DOCTOR: OK, and how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Since I was young, um like maybe years, couple years.
DOCTOR: OK, and then do you like how often are you getting the stuffiness? Is it like every day? Is it during the day at night? When do you usually get it?
PATIENT: It's kind of uhm, it's kind of all the time, to the point that I've somewhat gotten used to it. And it's just my, it's only on the left side and it's just always kind of stuffy. Initially I would have trouble falling asleep 'cause it would, I would just find it a little bit bothersome, but now I'm kind of just used to it.
DOCTOR: OK, and so it's just on the left side. It never moves to the right side.
PATIENT: Well, like sometimes when I get ill its on both sides, but usually it's on the left side.
DOCTOR: OK, and so you have stuffiness. But do you ever get any kind of discharge or drainage from your nose?
PATIENT: Sometimes I get a little bit bleeding.
DOCTOR: Are you, OK. Um, bleeding? Is it blood mixed into the discharge or drainage? Or is it like you get nosebleeds?

PATIENT: Oh yeah, it's great.
DOCTOR: Ok. So yeah, so mainly yeah. So there's all the questions I had for you. Do you have any questions or concern?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Ok so there can be many different reasons for this chronic congestion and we'll do a full physical examination for you today. Uh and some of the possible things that can be happening is you might be having a sinus issue like a chronic sinusitis. You can be having an allergic rhinitis or with the snoring and just the chronic congestion. You may be also having something called obstruct, obstructive sleep apnea. And there can be structures in your mouth, throats that can cause you to kind of obstruct and snore at night as well, and that even the congestion might cause that as well. So yeah, we'll do a couple test first and then if required, we might need to do some imaging and even perhaps send you to an EMT specialist if we think it's obstructive sleep apnea there. For now, we'll just do the physical examination to go from there.
PATIENT: Great, thank you.
DOCTOR: Welcome, take care.
