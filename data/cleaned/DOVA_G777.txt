DOCTOR: Uh when you have these low, these low glucoses in the 50s, do you feel it?
PATIENT: I felt them last night.
DOCTOR: You did, what time was that?
PATIENT: And the same this morning.  It was like it this morning, I feel so lightheaded.  I went downstairs and uh got me some glucose tablets.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And so this morning when I checked my sugars it was 102.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I know it was lower than that last night because like I said when I woke up I was so lightheaded and all that I had to walk downstairs and get some glucose and I just ate about four tablets of that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You felt lightheaded.  So it seems like what are the dates on all of these?
PATIENT: Well like I said, the last one is today.
DOCTOR: So this is from this morning?
PATIENT: And that's yesterday.
DOCTOR: This is from yesterday.
PATIENT: And the day before.
DOCTOR: So this reading right here is it from the morning or the night?
PATIENT: In the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: When I woke up that morning.
DOCTOR: And then what was dinner?  Bedtime was 125?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The blood pressure's been okay.  How much insulin are you taking now?
PATIENT: 74.
DOCTOR: 74?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How long have you been taking 74?
PATIENT: Since last week.
DOCTOR: Hmm, I think that might be a little too much for you.  And how much are you taking at lunch, I mean you're taking 74 plus three times a day, you give yourself shots?
PATIENT: Twice a day.
DOCTOR: Twice a day, what time?
PATIENT: In the morning and at bedtime.
DOCTOR: With regular insulin or with Aspart?
PATIENT: Who?
DOCTOR: Which kind of insulin, Aspart or regular?
PATIENT: I guess I do regular.
DOCTOR: Regular.  So you get that in the morning and at lunch time are you feeling lightheaded?  You have a lot of low readings around lunch.
PATIENT: Well see actually I don't get up till around 11 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So then I'm up to eat at 12 o'clock.
DOCTOR: What time are you, so let me understand.  At night what time do you give yourself the shots, the 74?
PATIENT: At 10 o'clock.
DOCTOR: 10 p.m.?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And before you give yourself the 74 you take your sugars right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay and that's the Lantus and then let me see what else you're taking, hold on.  And then regular.  How much are you doing of regular?
PATIENT: 5 in the morning and 8 at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I think we're gonna have to take you down a little bit.  So before this week you were doing 70 of Lantus at night?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you were over 200 and now you're in the 50s?  Hmm.  How's the diet been?
PATIENT: Same, exactly the same.
DOCTOR: Are you taking all your blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: And what time to do you take the 8 at night of regular?
PATIENT: About 10 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Oh why are you taking it at 10?
PATIENT: Cause that's when I go to bed.
DOCTOR: Well you should take the 74 at 10 and then you take the regular before dinner.  What time do you eat dinner?
PATIENT: I eat dinner around 8 o'clock, 7 or 8 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I think that we need to change when you're taking it okay.  And what time do you take the 5?
PATIENT: Once in the morning.
DOCTOR: What time in the morning?
PATIENT: Whenever I wake up, 12 o'clock, 11 or 12 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Even though your sugars are so low like that?
PATIENT: I donâ€™t get out of bed until 11:30 - 12 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm not trying to, I'm trying to make it so you don't have real low sugars cause I don't want, it's dangerous to be hypoglycemic right.  I want to make sure that we're taking care of you.  So you give yourself one shot at night at 10.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Or you give yourself two shots at 10?
PATIENT: One shot.
DOCTOR: One shot of the 74?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then you wake up in the morning and then before breakfast do you give yourself the 5?
PATIENT: Yes the 5 and the 74.
DOCTOR: But the 74 you said you give at night right?
PATIENT: I do that twice a day.
DOCTOR: Oh you do the 74 twice a day.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: So when you wake up at about 10, let's say 10 a.m., 10 to 11 a.m. you give yourself the 74.
PATIENT: Plus 5.
DOCTOR: Plus 5 and then again at 10 you give yourself the 74 plus 8.
PATIENT: 74 plus 8.
DOCTOR: Plus 8 okay.  But you don't eat after.
PATIENT: No.  I eat before.
DOCTOR: I think we're gonna have to change the way. Is that how they told you to take it?
PATIENT: I been taking it that way since I been on it.
DOCTOR: Because your blood sugars, see the 5 and the 8 are supposed to be covering you for your meals.  Do you have breakfast every day when you wake up?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do you eat lunch?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: What time do you eat lunch?
PATIENT: When I get up.
DOCTOR: Okay so you get up in the morning and you eat something.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then so you only have two meals a day?
PATIENT: Basically.
DOCTOR: And then you have your dinner.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  Let me think about how we're gonna change this so that you don't get these lows cause I don't want you to get these lows you know.  Cause it's dangerous and you're feeling it right.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let's see what else is going on with you.  Um any more bleeding from your rectum?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Black stools?

PATIENT: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: Let me see.  Uh I don't know how to find it.  Hold on; let me ask DOCTOR how I find when it was.  This is for you.  The other thing that I wanted you to do is your nighttime insulin, I want you to take you before you eat dinner instead of at 10 okay.  So take your morning in the morning like you've been doing.  Have your breakfast or lunch or whatever meal you eat.  Then take your nighttime insulin before dinner okay.  And make sure you check your sugars and if you're still getting those lows in the morning then I want you to drop back down to 70 instead of 74. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I want you to come back and see our pharmacist in 1-2 weeks, okay?  And then I want you to see me in three months and I'm just going to order some urine tests for you, okay?  And I think everything else is good.
PATIENT: Was there something you could give me for this shoulder?
DOCTOR: For the shoulder.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: You can take Tylenol.  Do you take Tylenol?  Do you want Tylenol?
PATIENT: I take acetaminophen.
DOCTOR: Acetaminophen, that's the same thing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: How much are you taking?
PATIENT: 500 I think.
DOCTOR: 500 how many times a day?
PATIENT: Twice.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well you can take it up to four times a day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: See if that'll help.  The other thing is on this I'm gonna have to put that you have HIV and hepatitis B cause they are communicable diseases, that means like if you were to get hurt and start bleeding then you know.
PATIENT: That's all VA.
DOCTOR: Okay I just wanted you to know.  Okay let me figure out how to find out about your tetanus alright, I'll be right back.
