DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Oh how you doing?
DOCTOR: Good to see you again.
PATIENT: Taking care.
DOCTOR: Try to, how about you?
PATIENT: Yeah, I'm still this side of the grass.  I always figure if you wake up breathing that's half the battle.
DOCTOR: Yeah it is.  Someone said you were in recently with some hand tremors.
PATIENT: Yeah I started to develop shakiness in my right hand.  In the morning, I'd try to drink a cup of coffee; if I didn't grab it with both hands I would wear it.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: If you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh I came in and I saw Neurology and they checked me out and they put me on a medication, there's a new medication on there that I take in the evening.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And they said it would probably calm the quivering and so far it's about as good as it's going to get yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know, I mean, I can hold my left hand perfectly still but the right hand's almost perfectly still now.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: I just take the pill at night.  I don't know what it is, it's some kind of an anti-seizure medicine they put me on but uh I had been getting these off and on, uh I get uh sort of a shooting pain that comes up the right side of my neck.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Into my head and it feels sort of like a firecracker going off.
DOCTOR: How long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Uh oh like three or four months and then if I just, you know shake the hell out of my head, like so, it'll go away.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's the only way I finally get rid of it.  It's just, bam, gone and I told them about that so they did a bunch of tests on me and checked out and they said everything seems to be right but they suggested trying this seizure medication and they said that could be possibly what was doing, with the shakiness of my right hand, the tremors.
DOCTOR: Did they do any imaging? CT? MRI?
PATIENT: Uh I don't remember.  I've got the world's worst memory.
DOCTOR: Where was it done here?
PATIENT: Here. Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah but they were mostly physical tests and they said that everything seemed to be normal.  I had the same uh strength in both arms and you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And all that sort of thing and then they said we'd try this but now I haven't had one of those since I started taking the pill.
DOCTOR: You're not having any headaches either?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Fevers, chills?
PATIENT: No I never get headaches.
DOCTOR: So this pain that you get up here, is it neck pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, it would just be like you know like my neck would go stiff and I would just feel it going up my neck and then when it gets up here it'll like go pow so, I do not get headaches.  I don't take aspirin.  Uh I'm probably odd that way but headaches for me are very, very, very rare.
DOCTOR: Well this pain you're getting, this neck pain.
PATIENT: I haven't had it since I started taking the pill they put me on.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it did, like I say, I'm holding my right hand almost perfectly still and they said that that, you know, it might.  They thought it would take care of the hand and it might take care of what was going on with the neck so, whatever it was I think they figured that out and the only pain I got out of the normal right now I got a pain in my right kidney but I think I got a kidney stone that's coming down.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm had them before and it's the same pain, right here you know.  It hurts to lay on the right side at night and then it just lets you know it's there all the time.  It hasn't started descending yet.  Usually I get the pain there and then it works its way around and you get it up here and eventually I pass them.  Over the years I've passed a bunch of them.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I was told that uh my system makes too much calcium and I have to watch you know milk and dairy, anything with calcium in it because my system tends to produce a lot of calcium and I, I don't know what I did but I must a had something I shouldn't had.  You know my wife has a fit every time she sees me putting gravy on something.  I used to be able to sit down and eat like eggs and sausage and hash browns and have a couple of biscuits with gravy and of course that's cream gravy over in the morning.  I had to stop that completely because it's a cream base and uh every time you know I order meat loaf and get mash potatoes, they put brown gravy over them and she's you know what you’re going to get from that.  It's not white you know.  It's not milk.  She says there's a milk base in it, whether it's white or not.  You know so she tries, she tries to keep an eye on me and keep me from doing it.  But every once in a while I'll do something stupid.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: You know, I'll forget about it and order a malted milk, drink it.  So that's like sliders, White Castles.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I love the smell of them and if I'm driving by a White Castle and I'm hungry, I'll usually stop and get me four or five sliders and every time I eat them, an hour later they [REDACTED] right here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I am just miserable for two days until they pass but then I forget about the pain and six months down the road I drive by another White Castle, I happen to be hungry and [REDACTED].  So some of us never learn you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They used to say that wisdom and patience come with age.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I didn't get either one.  I have no patience.  Wisdom is supposed to be learning from all the mistakes you've made and I just keep making them over and over and over, you know.  I'll never learn, it's just my way.  I'm 64, if I didn't learn by now I'm not going to.  You know old dogs and new tricks.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So and then I'm miserable until I get rid of the sliders or until, till I finally get the kidney stone through.
DOCTOR: So I know you were seen in the Lipid Clinic with DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: They were trying the uh weight loss and changing the diet cause your diabetes isn't that well controlled.
PATIENT: Yeah.  They talked to me about it and I've been watching my intake uh.  I've been trying to get my weight down.  When I went there I was about 260 when I saw them.
DOCTOR: You've lost about eight pounds since back then.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So whatever you’re doing.
PATIENT: I don't lose a lot you know.  I lose slowly but, it comes off.  I'm at about 250 now and uh I weighed 235 when my son was born 35 years ago you know.  So I'm 15 pounds over, probably my normal weight when I was young.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But uh I don't think I'll ever be 235 again but I'm watching the carbs.
DOCTOR: That's good.
PATIENT: So you know that is basically the thing.  If you watch the carbohydrates, everything else takes care of itself.  I don't eat anything with sugar.  I don't drink alcohol.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh I drink iced tea with artificial sweetener or lemonade or diet root beer, Diet Coke, water, that kind of stuff but I haven't had any alcohol in probably five years.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause they told me the alcohol would just turn to sugar in the blood stream and I’d have problems, so.  I figured why do something stupid?  I like root beer just as well as I ever liked beer.  I can get diet root beer.
DOCTOR: Have you ever smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: How much?
PATIENT: I used to smoke three packs of Lucky's a day for years and then I swore off the Lucky's and I uh took up smoking a pipe and cigars and the last cigar I smoked was a year ago January, last January.  So it's almost a year and a half since I've had anything to smoke.
DOCTOR: When did you quit cigarettes?
PATIENT: Cigarettes probably 15 years ago.  But I had my crutch.  I smoked a pipe, I smoked cigars.  I didn't inhale them.  I puffed on them but I still smoked them.
DOCTOR: And no illicit drugs I take it?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: No illicit drugs?
PATIENT: No nothing ever than what's on the sheet there.
DOCTOR: Gotcha.
PATIENT: I don't even take aspirin.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: So.  I used to take a child's aspirin in the morning but I'm on atenolol and atenolol was a blood pressure deal so you know.
DOCTOR: But uh the atenolol lowers your blood pressure.  The aspirin stops you from having heart attacks or strokes.
PATIENT: Oh well.  I could start taking it.  I used to take a St. Joseph's children coated aspirin.
DOCTOR: Yeah, 81 mg.
PATIENT: In the morning, yeah the little thing they're orange.
DOCTOR: Yeah, right.
PATIENT: My wife was buying those.  I used to take one each morning.  I've got my pills broke down for morning and evening so.
DOCTOR: You should add the aspirin back.
PATIENT: Okay, I'll put that back in there.
DOCTOR: Any bleeding, any blood in your stool or anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay any uh reflux or anything like that?
PATIENT: No.  The only thing like I say is my right kidney.  I've had enough kidney stones, I know what it is.
DOCTOR: Is the tramadol enough for the?
PATIENT: Uh well, I'm in pain but no the tramadol doesn't do anything for kidney stones.
DOCTOR: You want to go on some Vicodin for a few days?
PATIENT: There used to be uh, let's see when I had my first kidney stone, what did they put me on, Thoronol.  Touronol, something like that, I don't know but I ended up in the hospital because I thought I had appendicitis.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know, I had had the back pain and the back pain moved and when it got down here it was excruciating and it was down in the bottom right side.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And my wife said your appendix, your appendix is going to burst, it's your appendix.  I went to the Emergency Room and they checked me out and uh they said no you've got a kidney stone descending and they put me on something, I think it was called Toradol and it took away the pain but the pain was up here, it wasn't in my back.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know and I only took it for like two days.  The third day I finally passed the kidney stone.  The darn thing was as big as the fingernail on my small finger.  Yeah.
DOCTOR: I can’t imagine.
PATIENT: Oh yeah I peed blood for a couple of days after that and the funny thing was, before that came out they had given me a strainer.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I was peeing in the strainer and chunks of raw meat were coming out in the straining you know and these can't be kidney stones, you know.  You could see it was like raw meat.  Kidney stones are hard and I guess it was, you know what it was pushing out on its way out.  Probably opened the urethra.
DOCTOR: Can I ask you another question; do you still take the hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes I do.
DOCTOR: Okay you take that and the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I take that every morning.  That's a water pill isn't it?  Yeah cause I'm in the bathroom all the time.
DOCTOR: Do you check your blood glucose at home?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What does it normally run?
PATIENT: I fluctuate between oh maybe 115 and 140.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I kind of go up and down like yo-yo, within that range.  Occasionally I'll pop up around 150 if I've had a piece of somebody's birthday cake or you know my wife always, no you got to have a piece, one piece won't kill you and then the next morning I run it and holy mackerel you know.  But.
DOCTOR: 115 to 140?
PATIENT: Yeah 115 to 140 approximately.  I try to keep it down under that 140 mark.
DOCTOR: What do you take the Benadryl for [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Oh that's for this.
DOCTOR: Psoriasis?  Oh yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You're back on Enbrel?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is it getting better?
PATIENT: It's better than it was.  Yeah my leg down here has pretty much cleared up.  The other leg here has you know cleared up except of course it leaves scars.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I mean I was just raw meat there when I was off the Enbrel and I was breaking out.  I had it all over my back, my arms, up my neck uh.  I was getting it from head to toe there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So when I went back on the Enbrel I take one shot a week and it's pretty much kept it in check.  This one big splotch up here on my right thigh is still left over from when I had the breakout.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I keep forgetting and I keep scratching the damn thing here, which is what I'm doing now, through my pants and that's why it won't go away cause I'm irritating it.  I know, you know, if I'll leave it alone it'll go away but I don't think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know all of a sudden something itches and you scratch it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's like a mosquito bite to me, you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: All of a sudden, hey wait a minute, you know and then you realize when you're scratching it that you now see blood running down your arm cause you've just torn it open.
DOCTOR: Have you ever seen uh a kidney specialist, a renal doctor?
PATIENT: Uh not that I know of.  You know they have monitored my uh different levels including part of the uh blood tests for the kidneys to be sure that uh that my renal functions were normal and they said I was a little high but it had come down and it was within reason.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So you know it's and my kidneys work, it's just uh.  Oh I've got good kidneys believe me.  I'm like the race horse; you know I'm in and out of the bathroom all the time.
DOCTOR: When was your last eye appointment?
PATIENT: Eye exam?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: About a year ago I think.  I'm not good with dates.
DOCTOR: You had your retinal screening for diabetic retinopathy.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: In 2008.
PATIENT: Okay that was the last one I had.  And uh I had new glasses because my eyes got a little worse than they were the previous time.  I wear bifocals.  Not a lot different, just a little.  Yeah I got to see that where they showed me the screen with the pictures of the back of my eyeball.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I was in pretty good shape.  Nothing was eaten away.  That's what they try to watch for.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I guess, its degeneration.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.
PATIENT: And mine are still where they belong.  Nothing's falling off.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Or falling apart.
DOCTOR: Why don't you come over here?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Do you want me to take my shirt off or?
DOCTOR: Uh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I got a t-shirt too.  My generation we all wore t-shirts.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Even on hot days?
PATIENT: Well on hot days we just wore t-shirts.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You know you're working around the house, working on the car or cleaning out the garage or out in the yard playing with the kids.  Now I'm out in the yard playing with the grandkids.  I've got an 8-year-old granddaughter whose sole purpose in life is to run me into the ground.  But I try to keep up with her.  I've still got the psoriasis on my back.
DOCTOR: Right here on your back, back here.
PATIENT: Yeah.  You know once you get it, it never goes away.
DOCTOR: A couple of deep breaths.  Okay.  You can breathe normally, I’m just going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Still pumping.
DOCTOR: Still pumping away.  Any swelling in your legs at all?
PATIENT: No not really.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's the one thing that the Enbrel stops because my knees and my ankles get like footballs, wow.  It's all liquid and has to be drained with hypos.
DOCTOR: You look at your feet regularly?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.  Yeah I'm fanatical about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, the ankle looks okay.  I want to see what your blood pressure was.
PATIENT: It was a little high but I drove in traffic.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  [REDACTED] check that [REDACTED].
PATIENT: When you're retired and you don't drive in traffic, trying to get [REDACTED] to here it's like four o’clock in the afternoon and the world was out for lunch.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: A lot of aggravation.  I mean I'm in the right lane, I'm doing the speed limit, I just don't go over it and everybody seems to think they need to drive up my tail pipe.
DOCTOR: 127 over [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Now I'm good, from what it was cause I think it was like a 160.
DOCTOR: Oh wow.
PATIENT: On the high end.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: On the top number.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And usually my blood pressure is pretty low.  I check it at the Jewel-Osco.  They got a machine but of course how accurate those are I don't know.  They tell you not to you know.  Take it as a clinical reading, see your doctor.  Yeah if you can give me a few of whatever to just knock this out of my kidney I'd appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Sure absolutely.
PATIENT: I don't take anything other than what's on my list there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's exactly what I take and as soon as they take me off one, I pitch whatever I've got.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: Let me talk to uh.
PATIENT: I'm always afraid of an interaction.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  We’ll get  you sorted out.  Never take anything you don't have to take.
PATIENT: Well, it's like I say I know what it is.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: It's right here and when I oh, when I bend that way it lets me know it's there too.  But when I lay on my side, on my right side.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: There's no way I can lay that it doesn't hurt.  I have to roll over and lay on the left side and I'm a right side sleeper.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: That's where it aggravates me at night cause I keep forgetting and rolling back over and it's like oh.  My wife says what are you doing?
DOCTOR: Just hold your hands up like that.
PATIENT: 43 years of marriage.  Oh towards me?
DOCTOR: Push yeah.
PATIENT: Oh push.
DOCTOR: There you go.  Hold your arms up like this, just keep them up.  Does that hurt at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Can you kick your legs out towards me, back towards you, good, okay.  Um can you squeeze my hands [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Sure.  Hard.
DOCTOR: Yeah as hard as you can, good, okay.  Did they feel about the same?
PATIENT: Yeah I'm.
DOCTOR: Okay hold your hands out again.
PATIENT: Like I say I still do get a little shake in the right but it's nowhere near what it was.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Man I was, I would have it on the arm of the chair and hear my fingernail clipping against the chair not realizing that I was doing it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So it was odd, I don't know.  I just all of a sudden developed that stupid thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh I thought it was you know maybe my sugar was low.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And maybe that was causing it cause you know when my sugar drops I get like double vision so I know if my sugar's getting low I start to carb up.
DOCTOR: Your balance is okay?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Any trouble walking at all?
PATIENT: Well I got arthritis.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Both legs, spine, right arm, you know.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] things like that.
PATIENT: I can't walk any distance; my legs start to hurt really bad.
DOCTOR: Can you raise both of your arms overhead.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Just, it's psoriatica arthritis?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And thanks to psoriasis.  You know I never had psoriasis my whole life until the diabetes and I asked uh the diabetes specialist you know about it.  You know it's just strikes me as so odd. And he said well you may have had a recessive gene for the psoriasis and your normal function kept it in check but when you developed the diabetes it reduces your immune system and that gene can become predominant and that's what happened.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: And sure as hell it goes crazy when I stop the Enbrel I stopped the Enbrel for about 2 1/2 months and I was running from toe to neck.  Luckily it stopped before it got to my face.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause they leave scars you know.  You can take care of them but you're going end up with scars on your face I'd rather not have.  My face isn't that great to begin with and I don't want to scare my grandkids.
DOCTOR: I'll be back in just a couple of minutes okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  54:15  DOCTOR IN:  68:37)
DOCTOR: Okie dokie.  So I just talked to DOCTOR.  Um a couple of things.  One, you know that your diabetes isn’t really a goal and so we need to add another medication.  Um.
PATIENT: Other than the glipizide?
DOCTOR: Yeah, in addition to it.
PATIENT: Oh, leaning the wrong way, excuse me.  I don't mean to laugh but it's easier to laugh than cry.
DOCTOR: Um because of your kidney disease we can't start you on metformin.
PATIENT: No I was on that once before and they took me off of that cause it was showing on something on the kidneys.
DOCTOR: And so the other, then there's um well there's three options.  The way your sugars look now um, there's a medication called Acarbose you would take with meals, it's a pill.  To be honest, it probably wouldn't get you to goal but it would improve things a little bit.  The other one is starting insulin um.
PATIENT: Yeah when I was in the hospital last June they had me taking the insulin shot so when I was in the ICU.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] 5 units in the morning and check your blood sugar after.  You know it sounds like you're checking your blood sugar in the morning and it sounds pretty normal.  So your fasting sugar is pretty good.  [REDACTED] higher, that's probably why you're having these signs and so if you did 5 units of insulin in the morning it would probably be better throughout the day, when you are and then the third option is a medication called Actos which is.
PATIENT: Don't know what it is.
DOCTOR: So it’s part of the same drug class that there's a lot of medication they've been in the news a lot recently.  It's called [REDACTED], pioglitazone, rosiglitazone are a few drugs um.
PATIENT: I take uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] medication. [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I did have a heart attack once.  I've been through an angioplasty.
DOCTOR: And so while they're still figuring it out I wouldn't start it.  There is a lot of back and forth going on.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And so that leaves us with two options, insulin or Acarbose.
PATIENT: Well why don't we try the Acarbose and see if that alters it and if it doesn't alter it then I'll start on the insulin.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So the Acarbose.
PATIENT: Try the pill first and then the insulin is the last ditch alternative.  It doesn't bother me, I mean hell I inject the Enbrel in my stomach every week anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They were amazed when I was in the ICU I just had them give me the shots, come on I'll do it you know.  Oh okay you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So um.
PATIENT: You just get used to it.
DOCTOR: Can you check your glucose twice a day now, in the morning when you wake up and that any one time during the day two hours after a meal?  We need to see how it looks after a meal so.  You can do it after lunch or any time.
PATIENT: After dinner?
DOCTOR: After dinner yeah so um.
PATIENT: Yeah dinner is easier cause a lot of times I'm out running during the day.  I pick my granddaughter up at 3:00-3:30 from her childcare then we go to the park and basically she tries to do everything in the park which means we go from the swing to the teeter-totter you know and she jumps off and runs and I'm dragging along behind her.  But that's probably why I'm losing weight cause now the summer's here and it's hot and we can go to the park every day which we couldn't do in the winter and we couldn't do it much this spring because of the rain so.  Each night I get my exercise with her before dinner and then we go back home and have dinner with my wife.  It's a routine, she enjoys it.  I enjoy the hell out of it too.  It's like having kids again.  I always enjoyed my kids.  It just broke my heart that they had to grow up and become teenagers and then get married and move out then you lose them.  It's really hard when it’s girls you know.  My son I could face losing him, the girls were hard.  The old saying about a daughter's a daughter, what is it a son's a son till he takes a wife but a daughter's a daughter all of her life.  There's a lot of truth to that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Daughters, you know they keep in touch with their parents, they show up for the holidays and they call mom a lot.  We see the grandkids a lot but my son, you know once they get married they become part of their wife's family so.  You might get to see them on holidays, that's about it or if I go golfing with my son.  He's 35, he’s the baby.  He's still single.  I keep telling him, my name's going to die out you know.  Your sisters’ kids don't have my name.  He says don't worry about it dad, if it dies out I've got cousins.  I go I don't want to hear that.
DOCTOR: You want to pick it up at the window or do you want us to mail it to you?
PATIENT: Probably mail it, it's fast.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I always get the stuff like two days later; they're good about it here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh they're fantastic with the Enbrel.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Every time I've called that in, sometimes it's the next day it shows up.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: It's in a little freezer pack; you know a little cooler with the white ice.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah dry ice.
PATIENT: Freezer pack things in them.
DOCTOR: Now the Vicodin, do you want to get that here or do you want us to mail it to you?
PATIENT: You can mail it to me; I'll just take a couple of Toranols.  See I take a Toradol before I go to bed at night and the reason I do that is this stupid arthritis is all the way through my spine and into my neck but the worst is my lower back.  I wake up in the morning, I can't stand up straight you know and the Toranol when I take it at night, I get up in the morning and I don't have that sharp pain in my lower back.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I don't know if I'm becoming dependent on it but I've noticed that just taking it at night eliminates that morning walking around looking for nickels.  And like all these things, pretty soon your neck is starting to bend and your spine is starting to go this way, it won't be long you're going to be walking around looking for change.  So well maybe I'll find a lot of money, what the heck, here's the positive aspect to it.  I just don't want to be like my grandfather.  His height shortened about four inches and he was stopped over when he was in his 70s.
DOCTOR: And another thing, well you still have this anemia, are you taking any iron?
PATIENT: Oh, it is?  They put me on uh, what do they call them, iron pills.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I was on it for the longest time and they were horse pills and I took those things and it didn't make a difference, it just stayed the same.  Uh they did an upper GI, a lower GI; they checked everything out on me.  They thought I was bleeding internally but nobody ever found where.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: The last step [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I have no idea what it is.
DOCTOR: Between the upper and the lower.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um there is the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Is that the one where you drink the barium?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I went through that.
DOCTOR: You had a small bowel follow through?
PATIENT: Yeah, they did everything on me and uh they didn't find any leaks anywhere.  I had uh when they did the, oh what do they call that rear end special uh, I can't think of the name of that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Where they feed the camera up your colon.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Colonoscopy.  When they did that they pinched off three polyps.
DOCTOR: But they never did a capsule?
PATIENT: What's that the camera thing?
DOCTOR: It's a little pill you swallow.
PATIENT: It's got a camera in it?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: No I never did that.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: They did everything else under the sun and it's not like I'm not healthy.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know, I had this for like three years and I'm still walking around in the same shape I was three years ago it's not affecting me anyway.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I don't know why I would be anemic.  I eat, you know I don't eat a lot of red meat but I eat pork, I eat turkey, I eat fish and chicken.  I have a small amount of red meat a week but I have to watch that because of the arteries you know.  I can't go eating steak every night.  I might have it once a week but that's about it.  So and I'm in the process of trying to work with the carbs to get the uh the diabetes back down.  That's what worked for me last time.  I thought I had to stop starches so I quit eating bread and pasta and all this stuff and then I met with the dietician, no you got it backwards you know.  You don't have to give up potatoes.  You don't have to give up bread, you don't have to give up pasta but there are pastas that have lower carbs.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So my wife's been buying this stuff, I don't know it's only got like 15 carbs versus 51 in the normal pasta.  It's about three times the cost but she buys it cause I can eat it.  Uh drain [REDACTED] or something like that.  It's a funny name but it tastes like normal pasta so.  Then my mom was Sicilian so I grew up on that stuff.  You know there was pasta on our table even at breakfast, lunch there was always a pasta salad out there.  Hard to cut something off you've had your whole life.
DOCTOR: That's true.
PATIENT: And I did stop drinking red wine. That would probably be something I should go back to.  But see it's a toss-up because now the wine has the alcohol but red wine is good for the heart and good for cholesterol and it could balance out, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Uh I mean red wine is good for the heart.
PATIENT: But it's still got alcohol in it so it messes me up on the glucose.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I gave it up totally, but I used to enjoy a glass of a dark red wine with pasta.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But once in a while my wife buys it, she still drinks it, I get to watch.  Um.
DOCTOR: Merlot, Cabernet?
PATIENT: Cabernet sauvignon that's what it is and she likes merlot too.  My son, every time he comes out to visit us, he lives in Chicago and he comes out to visit Carol Stream and he always brings his mom a bottle of wine.  He always shows up at dinner time then I get to watch the two of them.  I get ice water, lemonade but, she says it's my own fault.  I did too much craziness when I was young, that's why I ended up diabetic.  I will admit I used to have a sweet tooth the size of Texas.  I'd buy a dozen donuts on my way to my office, eat six in the car on the way there then get in the car and eat the other six on the way home before I had dinner when I got home.  My weight really shot up but I never met a donut I didn't like.  She always said the heart attack was a mixed blessing to make me lose weight.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Make me change my ways so.  It's been 14 years now.  I was 50.  So I must be doing something right, I'm still here 14 years later.  Weighing less and in better shape I was than when I had it and I was only 50.
DOCTOR: Okay I got everything in there for you.  Um some labs, uh we're going to get [REDACTED].
PATIENT: If I went down there now could they get me now?
DOCTOR: Yeah. Probably yeah.
PATIENT: What is it just blood tests?
DOCTOR: Yep but when they do this [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's what you do when you swallow a pill and it's just a little battery-operated camera that takes pictures.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: As it goes through you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It's pretty easy.
PATIENT: No I never took that.
DOCTOR: So basically.
PATIENT: But I did do the barium, milkshake or whatever it was and.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh they did the upper GI and the lower GI and like I say everything just checked out okay.
DOCTOR: Good.  So.
PATIENT: No news was good news.  I'll go down to the Lab now and uh take a number and they can tap me and do whatever they got to do.
DOCTOR: So glucose two hours after a meal and starting that new medicine and the Acarbose you'll get in the mail.
PATIENT: Okay and then when I get that take it before each meal or one meal a day.
DOCTOR: No before each meal.
PATIENT: Oh three times a day.
DOCTOR: Yeah it'll it binds with sugar and so it may give you some looser stool.  If it really bothers you and you don't think you're doing well then we'll switch to insulin.
PATIENT: Well the heat bothers me and everything turns to liquid in me.  That's just from the heat.  I can't help that, it's the way it affects me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know I, everything turns to water but I do drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Every day I probably average one or two Diet Cokes a day, three to four bottles of water a day, a cup of coffee in the morning, that's a lot of liquids so you know the liquids, got to go through and sometimes it comes through the wrong end so.  But I do drink a lot more water when it's hot out than I do when it's cold.  And if anything comes up weird on the blood just give me a call, they've got my cell number on there, just call and let me know what it is or if you need me to come back in for something else.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Then like I say, they always call me up or send me a letter and ask me to call them just to make an appointment.  If it's something that I need to come in earlier, if they should find something, fine just let me know I'll be in.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Thank you.
PATIENT: I'm retired, the only thing I've got to do is get my granddaughter to the childcare in the morning and get her at 3 in the afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Which is going to be a little tight but usually they're pretty good down there in the afternoon with drawing blood.
DOCTOR: So uh you can take this to the check out.
PATIENT: Check out okay.  I thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, take care now.
DOCTOR: You too.
PATIENT: 87:10
Time is 2:16 p.m.
