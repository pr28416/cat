DOCTOR: PATIENT.
PATIENT: How you doing?
DOCTOR: Good to see you again, hi.  [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Some lady gave me one of those tape recorders.
DOCTOR: Here we go right in there.  Sorry what was that?
PATIENT: They give me one of them tape recorders so.
DOCTOR: Oh they did.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Where do you want me to sit down?
DOCTOR: Uh right there is fine.  How are you doing today?
PATIENT: Uh so far so good.
DOCTOR: Okay um anything specific you wanted to discuss?  I know you were recently in the hospital so we'll talk about that but um anything else or have you been doing okay since you were discharged?
PATIENT: Uh I been doing pretty good all except my leg is hurting me in the morning.
DOCTOR: The leg pain, still having that.
PATIENT: Yeah but [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON B393
It is not arthritis and I don't find, he's still having the pain but it is because that he, he has not been taking his Synthroid [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON B393
And um it wasn't arthritis.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.  And I'm a little miffed; I'm little ticked because when we spoke to you.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON B393
Everything that I told you exhibited, I told him I have to rush him here in the ER and he was almost comatose and everything that I told them was, it was classic of hypothyroidism so sometime maybe you know remember to listen to your patients, everything that I told you know don't and I understand this is [REDACTED] deal.  See I been a nurse for a long time so I do understand it but perhaps, maybe not, but perhaps we could have alleviated this and we could have skirted it another way had you listened instead of just maybe sloughing it off and I, so I'm a little ticked.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON B393
You understand?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON B393
So it may not help him now but it may help someone else.
DOCTOR: No I understand that um.  Let me just fill something out there.  Yeah so the thing is the last time we had checked his thyroid studies were in March of 2010 and they were normal.
SECOND PERSON B393
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The thing is, we don't routinely check those with patients if they're taking the medications and you know you told me about some of the pains and I'm trying to remember exactly what else we talked about last time.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um, you know you've been talking about the hip pain um and then I mean.  You know we talked about the medications.  I know there've been some questionable you know what he'd been taking and what he hadn't been but you know what else did we talk about that detail that may.
SECOND PERSON B393
We talked, I remember distinctly.  Remember I told you that the skin was ashen.  I told you I said just look at his skin it's just taunt, black, he was having the tearing of the eyes because I think you got him the appointment to go see the eye doctor.  All of this is related to hypothyroidism you know so sometime, maybe you would think that normally, I think that maybe you all need to go the extra nine, just put one foot forward a little bit more and he was quite ill.  He was quite, I ran every light getting him here and had we waited a little longer maybe the results would not have been as good.  It may have been irreversible and that you don't get back.  That means I don't get him back you know so and I know you probably get enough from the attendings but sometimes the little guy that we're supposed to be taking care of we need to take that extra step.
DOCTOR: Sure.  So I do apologize that we missed that.  You know like I said we had checked the labs just you know a year ago and everything was normal and you know I didn't really have any reason to believe he wasn't taking the Synthroid that we were having issues or you know the thing with hypothyroidism a lot of times it is, it you know in retrospect sure, you can look it up and say these are classic symptoms.
SECOND PERSON B393
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But you know it does present very vaguely and you know if you think you can find reasons for those symptoms it's not necessarily the first thing cause a lot of these disease processes present very vaguely.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: You know in retrospect it is easy to say you know I missed it but we didn't really have any reason to believe that that was the number one thing because you didn't tell me that he hadn't been taking the Synthroid and you know the lab had just been checked in a year but I do apologize.  I'm glad you know that they were able to catch that in the ER and that was taken care of.
SECOND PERSON B393
Yeah it can't be undone; we just go forward with it.  But I think that sometimes as health professionals we forget, we all get tired.
DOCTOR: Sure.
SECOND PERSON B393
We all have to remember you know there's this thing about do no harm and sometimes you know when we don't do anything it causes harm.You know so I can only speak from this side.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON B393
Because he's my number one priority.
DOCTOR: Sure.
SECOND PERSON B393
And I knew something was wrong with him you know for a long time.  Okay we're gonna go forward, I said my peace.
DOCTOR: Okay well how are you doing since you were discharged from the hospital?
PATIENT: Well pretty good so far.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're taking the Synthroid.
SECOND PERSON B393
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  Symptoms seem to be, are you still having the pain here?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Kind of the back part of the leg here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is it just starting up in the hip or is it just kind of localized?
PATIENT: Uh it moved down here.  It's not over there no more.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know if it's because of my wallet.
DOCTOR: You have it on both sides or just on the one side?
PATIENT: Both sides when I wake up in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: After about after an hour and a half it'll go away.
SECOND PERSON B393
But he did get this way over night.
PATIENT: But it just seemed like, it seemed like [REDACTED] a water in the car I call it you know.
DOCTOR: Does it go all the way down your leg or does it stop?
PATIENT: Right here on the side, thigh.
DOCTOR: Cause you know like I think we kinda discussed this last time, and it could be you know a nerve, kind of a nerve pain that with some compression.
PATIENT: That's what it feels like.  It feel like the nerve you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  And that's why you know I kind of wanted to start with the hips to see if anything was getting compressed there, if there were any bony abnormalities.  I don't think those were ever done correct?  Yeah [REDACTED] we talked about but I saw those were not done.  Um you know if it, is there a weakness or just kind of a pain?
PATIENT: It's a pain you know when you stand up.  You feel a pain there when you walk, you gotta walk stiffly so instead of it straightened out.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah I mean, we could if we want to pursue I think we could still take a look and see if there's anything here.  Otherwise if we, you know there's other things we could do.  We could do nerve conduction studies.
PATIENT: What.
DOCTOR: Those are a little more invasive and I don't think that's necessary.
PATIENT: If you don't catch me when I first get up you know about an hour and a half later, it's not there so, nothing to catch.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I mean I think it could be, you know, you're sleeping all night you're putting pressure here and that could be something and then once you get up.
PATIENT: That's what I thought.  It's easing up now.  I was sleeping on the couch, watching TV.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh that's when I stopped sleeping on the couch and getting in bed.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So if I sleep in the bed it don't get as bad since I’ve been sleeping in the bed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I figured it might because of the couch thing, you’ve got those pillows. You know, pillow to pillow to pillow.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I figured maybe the pillow, just changing the pillow that might be doing it.
SECOND PERSON B393
I'm just gonna tell him yeah no that's not it.  We just need a number bed, that's all we need is a number bed.  Now that's what I'm gonna put it on.  I'm holding out for the number bed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON B393
Fine.
DOCTOR: Sure, otherwise the other thing, I was looking through the hospital, you know the discharge summary and I'm sure they talked about doing all the imaging studies.  There's also cysts on your kidneys.
SECOND PERSON B393
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Um there was one on the left kidney that they wanted, you know that may need further work-up just to make sure it's not growing or it’s not.
SECOND PERSON B393
It's more than one.
DOCTOR: Well there was one specific.
PATIENT: I know there's one they were worried about.
DOCTOR: Yeah he had one multiple small ones but there was one specific on the left kidney that they want a follow-up on you know in terms of re-imaging.
SECOND PERSON 421
They will, but they will in maybe three months.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Yeah obviously not now but I'm saying that is one thing that we'll need to make sure we follow up on.
SECOND PERSON B393
Yes.
DOCTOR: So you know make sure it’s not growing or you now anything other than just a simple cyst.
SECOND PERSON B393
Yes.
DOCTOR: A lot of people have had you know simple cysts in the kidneys with not much to do there but.
SECOND PERSON B393
No but what he said was on the right there is one, no problem, don't worry about it.  The left side it's the one that is, his term was [REDACTED] and cancerous.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON B393
So for a, he seemed not to have heard it.  I've heard everything that the doctor said.  He kept looking for more; I guess he was waiting until I finally told him I understood.  He said he didn't tell me that.  I'm telling him yes he did.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
SECOND PERSON B393
Yes he did, so would you tell him?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SECOND PERSON B393
What he said.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean the thing is, you can't say it’s cancerous right now, but the reason we want to recheck is to make sure it’s not growing because then you're concerned for cancer.  You know we do a follow-up study and if it looks exactly the same in a couple of months then we're kind of reassured that it is just a cyst.
SECOND PERSON B393
Yeah.
DOCTOR: But if it has grown then we get a little bit worried, is this a cancerous lesions, do we need to get a biopsy, do we need further studies but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.  Um but you know in a month or two, probably in two months, you know we'll monitor.
PATIENT: I think he said in three months.
DOCTOR: Yeah so, so I mean that was kind of in the middle, end of November so we'll say around February maybe we'll get a repeat CT scan and see how that looks.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I’m supposed to have this [REDACTED] removed.
SECOND PERSON B393
They are going to remove it on the 9th of January.
DOCTOR: Yeah I saw that as well um.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay he's doing a thousand times.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So going back to kind of cause you know now knowing that you know there were issues with the medications in the past, what was, how can we prevent that from happening again?  What was the exact issue with not able to get the medication or not taking the medication?
PATIENT: Most likely it'd be not taking cause I got plenty of medicine.
SECOND PERSON B393
And I think his stomach was bothering him.  [REDACTED] we and his stomach was bothering him because he wasn't taking the Synthroid and I think that was the issue that we were not aware of because now that he takes it every morning he hasn't had no problems with his stomach.
DOCTOR: He hasn't had a problem okay.
SECOND PERSON B393
No [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And taking the medicine every day.
SECOND PERSON B393
Every day, every morning, every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well that's gonna be the key.
SECOND PERSON B393
At 5 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.
SECOND PERSON B393
He's up, so he's doing good.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  Any other problems today?
PATIENT: Yeah I want to know how many beers can I drink a day.
DOCTOR: What's that?
PATIENT: How many beers can I drink a day?
DOCTOR: Drink?
SECOND PERSON B393
The doctor told him one.
DOCTOR: Good.
SECOND PERSON B393
One beer a day.
DOCTOR: Oh one beer year.
SECOND PERSON B393
He drinks that.  You're not gonna stop him at one but he still gets.
PATIENT: Three.
SECOND PERSON B393
No.
PATIENT: One every hour.
SECOND PERSON B393
No.
DOCTOR: No.  It's better to cut down.
PATIENT: Not cut off though.
DOCTOR: Well he said one a day; I think that's probably the right amount.
PATIENT: That's not enough.
SECOND PERSON B393
He drinks two.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON B393
Because he's not gonna do one.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
SECOND PERSON B393
But he'll.
DOCTOR: He’ll do two.
SECOND PERSON B393
You're not gonna stop him at one so you have to have a cut off somewhere.  When the doctor told him three, he told him that is enough.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
SECOND PERSON B393
So he does drink two a day and I don't.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The thing I mean you know we can tell you what we recommend.  Obviously you know you go home and you know it's kind of up to you to go.  I think one or two is probably okay but I would try to cut down to one and eventually, if possible to zero but like I said I know that's a.
PATIENT: What about wine then?
DOCTOR: You can have one glass of wine a day, that's good.  One glass of red wine a day is good for your heart.
PATIENT: One glass of red wine and two glasses of beer?
DOCTOR: One or the other.
PATIENT: Oh shit.
SECOND PERSON B393
So take the two beers, take the two beers and I'll tell you he went to a birthday celebration.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON B393
And I think he had, that day, I think he had three.  For him that particular day, because it was a celebration he just kind of had to skirt it a little bit.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON B393
But now we back to okay, back to the two.
DOCTOR: Okay good.
SECOND PERSON B393
And he's been doing good.  He's real invested in trying.
DOCTOR: Good.
SECOND PERSON B393
I know that he's really been trying.  He is not happy.
DOCTOR: I can tell.  I can tell he’s not happy with that.
SECOND PERSON B393
But he's really been trying.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON B393
You know I worry but he's really been doing good and I know it's hard.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON B393
You know but my priority is to try to keep him here and keep him happy.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  That's good, that's really good.  Otherwise anything but you know I just, we just saw him you know a month ago.  Everything looks good since then.  Blood pressure you know, they measured it twice. Initially it was a little high it was 151/55 but they rechecked it 134/63 and then I read they wrote on here did not take blood pressure medicine this morning is that true?
SECOND PERSON B393
Yes he did.
PATIENT: Did I?
SECOND PERSON B393
Yes.
PATIENT: Okay.
SECOND PERSON B393
He took it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's that little bitty pill?
SECOND PERSON B393
Yeah where's the blue thing?
PATIENT: I think I must left it outside.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay, yes the pills are in there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON B393
They are in there.
PATIENT: So I did take all my pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean 134/63.
SECOND PERSON B393
It's really good.
DOCTOR: And maybe he set it up.
SECOND PERSON B393
And then I make him take his afternoon, it’s a little bitty pill is the tamsulosin that I give him [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay. Yeah so that's an important one, not to miss that as you know so.
SECOND PERSON B393
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh okay do you want to sit up here for me?  Lean back here.  I'll try not to splash on you.
SECOND PERSON B393
Don’t worry.
DOCTOR: Okay breathe normally for me alright.  Okay.  Nice deep breath for me in and out through your mouth for me.  Okay again, one more okay good.  Okay any pain down here anywhere?
PATIENT: Not yet no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any swelling?
SECOND PERSON B393
No that's fine.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Great.  Uh let me go talk to DOCTOR, I'll be back okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  20:25  DOCTOR IN:  28:58)
DOCTOR: Okay so a couple of things.  So I saw you have an appointment coming up in January with the Endocrine, right January 3rd.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll check the thyroid levels, this way before that, I mean we only check about six weeks or so after adjusting the dose or restarting the dose so.
SECOND PERSON B393
So, we’ll need to get his blood drawn today, right.
DOCTOR: Well no cause they started him again on November 19th when he was admitted.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: So this puts us at about a month so six weeks will kind of be the end of this month, end of December.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so we'll just check it.  That appointment's on the 3rd at 2:30 p.m.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: So you guys could come in the morning and get that drawn so that'll give it enough time to get the tests back or maybe the day before or is that.
PATIENT: Probably that morning.
DOCTOR: Kind of hard.
SECOND PERSON B393
Maybe in the morning.
DOCTOR: Maybe just that same day.  Just come a couple of hours before your appointment so is has time to kind of run in the Lab.
PATIENT: What's that appointment?
DOCTOR: I think that one for 2:30 um.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So that way you know just come in the morning, get the blood test done.  Cause that way you're gonna see that you know the thyroid specialist essentially so they can look at the numbers and if they need to adjust the dose then they can decide.  Um the CT scan I think we'll do,we’ll go ahead and do in February cause they said about three months.  So I'll put it in the computer now and then I want to see you back in about three months.  Does that sound okay?  So just before the appointment with me just come in and get the CT scan done and if the cyst has grown, if we need to you know.
SECOND PERSON B393
You'll see it then.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.  So we'll have some answers before next time.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um otherwise I think everything else is okay cause you know everything else we talked about last time um so I think those are kind of our big issues to focus on now and make sure the thyroid levels are responding you know appropriately and that cyst on the kidney has not grown.  Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so I'll put those in the computer so just the day of the Endocrine appointment, come in a little bit early to get your blood drawn and you guys know where to do that right by the entrance and then you'll schedule the appointment with me, I think they'll send you something in the mail, that’s what they usually do and before that appointment I'll put the CT scan order in already so you can just come in a couple days before and get the CT scan done.
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: So that sound good?
SECOND PERSON B393
Okay.
DOCTOR: Any questions?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay great.  So we'll see you back in three months and I'm glad to see you're doing better okay.  Just take that to the front desk.
PATIENT: Okay and they give me all the appointments again huh?
DOCTOR: Yeah the only appointment we're really scheduling is with me because the Endocrine's already scheduled um and I'll put in you know for the blood tests and CT scan, I just put that in the computer.
SECOND PERSON B393
Uh-huh.  What they do is when they give him another appointment they run them all again which is fine.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
SECOND PERSON B393
They just keep them in running order which is fine; you don't have to keep this one here and that one there.
DOCTOR: You've kind of got everything.
SECOND PERSON B393
Everything is put into order.  So it's better.
DOCTOR: It's a great system in this place here huh.
SECOND PERSON B393
It is.  It's a little hard to get to them but it's really good now.
DOCTOR: Yeah, good.  Yeah I'm glad.  Well alright then we will see you back in a couple months and of course if anything comes, you know if anything happens sooner.
SECOND PERSON B393
I know.
DOCTOR: Come back.
SECOND PERSON B393
I know that too.
DOCTOR: Before that.  Yeah if you can't get an appointment here the ER or Urgent Care.
