DOCTOR: OK, OK. Um has he tried anything for it? Have you given him any over the counter medications?
PATIENT: Yeah, we we did use some Tylenol and it brought the fever down so that was part of the reason why we we didn't come in 'cause he's had sore throats before but the fever bounced back and and the pain seems to have continued so we came in.

DOCTOR: OK, OK Um alright, so it sounds like, um grom what you're telling me, he ohh sorry, I should have asked you this earlier. Has he had any issues breathing?
PATIENT: Um no problems breathing, but his voice does sound a bit, a little bit off. A bit Husky.
DOCTOR: A bit Husky, OK. Um alright and nothing like a seizure like a febrile seizure, right?
PATIENT: No, I haven't seen any like limb jerking or anything like that.
DOCTOR: OK, so um, just roughly doing from the sounds of it, it sounds like he has a sore throat that's been persistent and we do this thing called the Centor score. So it sounds like he's had a fever, no cough, a sore throat. So the first thing that we want to check to see or to rule out would be a strep throat and then well if that comes back negative we will go from there and think about other viral causes versus strep throat as well.
DOCTOR: Did you have any questions or anything that I missed that you wanted to discuss today?
PATIENT: Um, no. We were thinking that it could be, uh, maybe strep throat. So um, yeah, thank you.
DOCTOR: OK, great, thank you.
