I don't know if that's called locked jaw but there are times when I open up my mouth and its hard and I go like that and I got to rub it out.  I should have brought my medical records, all this stuff is in my records.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um any trouble urinating or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No.

DOCTOR: Okay cause I was trying to see in your files to see if any lab has been ever done on you and the answer is no.
PATIENT: No you're my first doctor I've seen since I've been back.
DOCTOR: In October?
PATIENT: Yeah cause in October I didn't really see a doctor.  I saw the physician, or the person.
DOCTOR: The nurse practitioner?
PATIENT: That does my paperwork and I got a flu shot that day in October.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then that's it and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Then we probably have to have you come back and do labs, screening blood work, including your cholesterol.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You have a history of diabetes um.  Checking your A1C just to make sure that's normal and you have a history of hypertension, probably checking your urine just to make sure things are fine and we're not seeing any protein or any blood in your urine okay.
PATIENT: I don’t think I’m losing protein.
DOCTOR: Are you trying to lose weight at all or?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Why is that?
PATIENT: I'm done losing weight.

PATIENT: No I'm just eating what I want, when I want, how I want, how much that I want.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, okay.  It's something to keep in mind [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm good.
DOCTOR: Now I'm trying to see the last time you were here; you're blood pressure was really not that bad, it was like 130/72 and today it is [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That blood pressure is over and it can be like one day like I came in, in the service is a perfect example.  I came in one day to check, everybody was getting their medical check so I came in, got my blood pressure checked and it was extremely high and they're like we need to see you the next day.  I came in it was way low so they like we can't really tell with you and I'm like I know cause it's off.  I can come in one day and people are like you're gonna die and then the next day you're okay.  My blood pressure goes up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.  Stress, non-stress, what I eat, what I don't eat, what I've done for the day, if I relax all day, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Forget it; you'll be like this guy is driving me nuts with the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: No I mean it's been high the several times that you come in.  Let's say its high today and tomorrow its fine and you come back once a month later and its high I may say we need to maybe just start you on something.  I mean that is your choice [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So then we can go from there, we just have to keep an eye on it. So, you’ve tried a weight loss program or just a military work out?
PATIENT: Military.
DOCTOR: Which is fine.
PATIENT: No.  I had to speak to nutritionists.
DOCTOR: Where here?
PATIENT: No in the service.  They sent me to; when you are overweight they send you to a nutritionist right away.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And you got to sit there and listen to her, uh eat this portion with this and this and this, I'm like can you multiply that by five so I can actually have a good meal?
DOCTOR: Well I guess it's the portion size that.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.  That kind of stuff never worked for me.  Never worked, they're like okay main thing, I was like are you serious.  I live to eat, I don’t eat to live.
DOCTOR: How so you've been hypertensive since what age?  How long have you had the hypertension?
PATIENT: Hypertensive is what?
DOCTOR: Like high blood pressure.
PATIENT: High blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Yeah that they started you on the medicine you stopped taking?
PATIENT: Uh, let's see when I actually fully got checked out, I'd say maybe in '97 when I joined the Marine Corps and then I was in there for four years and I had and then I got out.
DOCTOR: You had it in '97?
PATIENT: '97 the blood pressure and they gave me meds and I stopped taking it there and I got out for five years, joined the Army, started me on the medication there and then I stopped taking it so it's like.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So maybe since '97, wow that's pretty young and you're 34 right?
PATIENT: That's because, yes 34.
DOCTOR: That's because what?
PATIENT: I was uh a very big boy when I was younger.
DOCTOR: How big?
PATIENT: Uh fat.  I went in [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You're 246 pounds now.
PATIENT: Yeah I was about that when I joined the Marine Corps and then within three months I came out I was 185 pounds, so in three months I lost all that weight and then a month later.
DOCTOR: From 250, 200?
PATIENT: To 180, cause I was called a fat recruit when they sprayed me with all the lines and I was on diet rations, all that crap and a month after I got out, I was back up again.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I cleared the systems and I was like bloop, not 250 but I was back up to like 220, 225, you know like that or back up, hey you're fat for your height.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: So some things worked for you in the past right.
PATIENT: Yeah if I went back to the Marine Corps boot camp whatever they had me doing there, the exercise and the sweating and the white rice with the skinless chicken and [REDACTED] all the plain stuff that they made me.
DOCTOR: Okay and then you said your left eye is itching?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What's going on?
PATIENT: I don't know, it just started itching.  I think it's because I had dirty hands or something and I touched my eye at work or something but it just feels funny and it's a little puffy.
DOCTOR: How long has that been going on?
PATIENT: This is day two.
DOCTOR: Anything coming out of it?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Has it been more red than usual?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Has your eye been pink?
PATIENT: I don't know if it's pink but its red, its looks a little bit red.
DOCTOR: Right now it's red?
PATIENT: Can you tell, I don't know, is there any difference or not?
DOCTOR: It just looks swollen.
PATIENT: It looks swollen okay.  I can feel it when I just move my eyeball.
DOCTOR: It just feels dry?
PATIENT: No not dry.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It itches.
DOCTOR: What have you tried on it or did you just let it?
PATIENT: I let it, I went into school this morning and I asked some of the mothers that go to school with me what to do and they're like don't do nothing just go get it checked out and get antibiotics so like okay.  I like to ask the moms.  They know best.  You know like Visine, flush, the eyes and see what happened.
DOCTOR: Probably wouldn't help.
PATIENT: That's why I ask the moms.
DOCTOR: Have a seat up here.  Nice and clean. [REDACTED].  Open your mouth, say ah and stick out your tongue, ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  I want you to swallow for me.  Swallow for me again.
PATIENT: Is it weird that sometimes my Adam's apple gets stuck and I got to shift it back.
DOCTOR: (laughter)
PATIENT: Into place, is that funny?
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Or does that happen [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um I'm not really; I never had anyone mention that.
PATIENT: No but it's like I'll be laying down on my pillow and it like shifts and I have to pop it back into place.
DOCTOR: How often does it happen?
PATIENT: Oh it's weird, on occasion yeah.  I don't mind, it's like oh let me shift it back that kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah, take a deep breath in for me.  Can you lay back?  I'm just going to go around your belly.  Do you want to try the Nutrition Help here?  No.
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Alright go ahead and sit up.  When do you think you'll be back to get the labs done?
PATIENT: If you want I could be back next week Thursday.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's my day off.  [REDACTED] right after school.  I would like to, also if I could, is there a possible way and how much it would cost if I get a vasectomy done, is it possible?
DOCTOR: Why would you want to do that?
PATIENT: Because I'm done having children.  I love my babies.
DOCTOR: How many kids do you have?
PATIENT: I have two, one girl and one boy, 8 and 6.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm not sure, I'm not sure if it's at the VA.  I doubt it's a procedure where it's going to be, they would pay for it.  Have you ever looked into that to see if they would pay for it?
PATIENT: When I was in I wanted to do it but I kept, my supervisor, whatever sergeant, he kept saying put it off, put it off, you can't do it, we got this to do.  So I wanted to get it done when I went, I was able to get it done because I was going to talk to the doctor to get it done and get it paid for while I was in.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: But the thing is now I'm out and I'm with the VA now, how much out of pocket or what.
DOCTOR: I don't know.
PATIENT: See that's what I need to find, I don't know who to speak to to find out all that's involved.
DOCTOR: I would have to check and see.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be back.
PATIENT: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  47:04  DOCTOR IN:  54:42)
DOCTOR: Alright good news is I can get you a referral for that [REDACTED] and you would have to, you would have to talk to the urologist and then they'll let you know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So I'm going to do a nurse recheck of your blood pressure.  We could go two ways, if it's consistently high, like obviously in the 140s then I would have to say we need to start you on the medicine okay.  I'll recheck, let me recheck the blood pressure now.
PATIENT: That [REDACTED] shouldn't even be around my gut.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's what I'm going to school for and I'm like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] turned [REDACTED] down.
PATIENT: Oh, you've got a way to figure it out.
DOCTOR: What shot did you get today.
PATIENT: She gave me the pneumonia.
DOCTOR: Pneumovax.
PATIENT: The Pneumovax.
DOCTOR: I know it’s tight, I just have to get it higher than the number she got.  140/90.
PATIENT: What'd she get?
DOCTOR: 150 something.  So both numbers are high.  So I would say overall the good news is if you do try to as far, even though I know you said you are okay with your weight, at least kind of watch what you eat.  Do you eat out a lot?
PATIENT: Yes every day.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Watching what you eat, low sodium diet, no honestly because sodium kind of ties in to high blood pressure.  So if you're eating out a lot, there's a lot more processed foods and um you're more prone to be hypertensive.  That's just the bottom line and then the other stuff would be as far as you know, I know what you know you were on medication, but at some point you were no longer on meds then if your weight does come down and you're watching what you eat you may not need the medicines.  For blood pressure, for cholesterol and the more your weight goes up the more you'll be prone to be snoring a lot at night.  Some people, I'm sure you've heard, have to use a CPAP, the mask that you use to sleep.  I mean, I'm just giving you things to think about.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: As far as long term issue.  I'm not trying to scare you or anything.  Just give you something to think about.
PATIENT: Uh yeah, I get scared [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And as far as like the eye stuff, I'm not giving you any antibiotics, this could go up on it’s own and usually what people do is use like just very warm compresses, like your washcloth.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And like really warm water and you just put it over it and it should get better within a couple days.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'll go ahead and order your labs and um so you said sometime this week right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: It's usually better, can you come in the morning cause you should not have eaten anything cause we'll be checking your cholesterol.
PATIENT: Let's see Tuesday morning is the only morning I can squeeze in there or Friday morning.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You can come whenever you have time [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We're checking the blood cholesterol and let me put in the referral.
PATIENT: Can I do a warm pack night combo something else because.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Because like there's nothing I could put in my eye right now just like a warm compact plus?
DOCTOR: Uh uh.
PATIENT: Something.
DOCTOR: Just the warm compresses.
PATIENT: I'm trying to nuke this thing; I don't want it to last three days.
DOCTOR: Just try to make sure it doesn't get infected.  I'll put in your referral and your contact number is PHONE NUMBER?
PATIENT: Yes it is.
DOCTOR: And I think you're all set.  You should hear from me sometime next week or in two weeks to follow up with the labs and the nurse visit to get the blood pressure.  Probably the day you come and get the labs drawn to get a blood pressure check okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Anything else?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Um and hopefully I'll be seeing you more regularly in the meantime.
PATIENT: No I don't want uh, I don't like coming to the hospital regularly.
DOCTOR: So for now, let's see we can follow up.
PATIENT: Now as you can see the last time I was here was in October.
DOCTOR: You can follow up in about six months.
PATIENT: Okay.  That's fine.
DOCTOR: And maybe sooner it depends on what the labs show how about that?
PATIENT: Okay.  That's fine.
DOCTOR: Alright.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The desk area?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: 63:23
Time is 2:30.
