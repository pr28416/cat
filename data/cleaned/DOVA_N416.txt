DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Is this your first visit here?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Blue Clinic.  Alright, let's see.  You've been to the ER, when was the last time?
PATIENT: I've been twice.
DOCTOR: Twice huh.
PATIENT: The first one was for chest pain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then the second one, I'd had a headache for four days and it turned out was a severe sinus infection.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Did they give you treatment for that?
PATIENT: Yes I'm taking uh antibiotics.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you feeling better?  Is your headache feeling better?
PATIENT: Yeah the headache is gone actually.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh you know I haven't, I haven't been able to really breathe out of my nose for the last ten years.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I've been to doctors uh and all they said was well you've got a sinus infection, they would give me antibiotic and no one would ever follow up including myself.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I just wanted.
(Knock on the door, doctor speaks with other person)
DOCTOR: Sorry.
PATIENT: No that's okay.  To make a long story short I haven't been able to breathe, really breathe or smell for almost the last ten years.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I've been basically mouth-breather for those years and uh the doctor was so great.  I mean I'm starting to smell again, stuff I haven't smelled for years.
DOCTOR: Oh really.  So you've been using a spray, that type of thing.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Alright.  Yeah so that's good.  So they just told you then, you of course you are going to complete those antibiotics?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: But after that the sprays you are supposed to keep doing, so don’t stop them. And if they’re helping you, that’s great. Um the clindamycin, did they give you, how many days did you use do you think?
PATIENT: They gave me a bottle about this big.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I usually take 12 a day so.
DOCTOR: Right.  Okay.  But yeah the fluticasone [REDACTED] fair enough.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and that should help drain things in the long run and the [REDACTED] so long.
PATIENT: And it got to the point where my gums were swollen and I think they're starting to recede now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But over the summer, it had gotten to the point where I mean you could barely see my front teeth on the top.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because the gums were really bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  And uh I see that you had a chest x-ray I'm just trying to see what the results were.
PATIENT: Yeah you now they called my house and gave it to my wife.  They told my wife something but I'm confused with what they told her or maybe she's confused as to what she heard.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Um and I haven't been able to get hold of anybody to call me back.  Basically what I get out of my wife's message was that they found uh some type of irregularity but it's no big deal basically is what she said.  Um but I'm thinking if there's anything [REDACTED] that's a big deal to me.
DOCTOR: Yeah, let me see what you might have. [REDACTED] almost seven minutes. What stopped you? You got tired?
PATIENT: From the stress test?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They just said, “Okay bring him down.” You know, I don't know.
DOCTOR: You were tired?
PATIENT: You know I work nights.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I work all night from midnight to 8.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So, I had just come from working and my legs were about to give out I just didn’t.
DOCTOR: Well the good news is that you actually had a normal stress test.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's [REDACTED] and I'm not sure what the abnormality they were talking about but there is a something [REDACTED] indicating what they call poor R wave progression.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And uh [REDACTED] that's probably what they [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So what's causing my chest pains?
DOCTOR: So let's talk about that.  Why don't you tell me about um, well first of all let me, there are some questions I need to ask you.
PATIENT: Sure, sure.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] questionnaire [REDACTED] a little background.
PATIENT: Yeah are  you going to be my, uh.
DOCTOR: So I'll be your primary care, but unfortunately I'm graduating in June so as long as [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's okay because I haven't really seen a doctor as far as a primary care physician in about 18 years.
DOCTOR: So let's get you established here and then DOCTOR will be your, he's going to be my supervisor and he'll be here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And he expects to be here.  Tell me about your past medical history, what else do you have?
PATIENT: Uh allergic to penicillin.  Um I had bronchiolitis as an infant.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I had my appendix taken out uh.
DOCTOR: How long ago?  How long?
PATIENT: It was in 99.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: 98, right around there, about ten years ago.  Um I've had two maybe three bouts of kidney stones.  I know the first one they did the fluids and they sent me on my way and that kind of helped a little bit but the second time I had to have the surgery.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Where they like they busted it up or did they have to go in?
PATIENT: No they had to go in.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Um I've got two bulging disks in my back, L4-L5 and those are from about 1987-88.
DOCTOR: Did they do anything?
PATIENT: The doctor didn't want to do; the doctor I was seeing at the time did not want to do surgery.  He did not believe in surgery for any of that so he just basically gave me anti-inflammatories.
DOCTOR: And then uh.
PATIENT: I was out of work for like three months.
DOCTOR: Because of the low back pain?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: So you had the kidney stones.  Any blood pressure?
PATIENT: The last time, no not the last time but as far back as I can remember it's been borderline.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh I was told to watch your weight you could bring it down.  Uh from when I first come in with the stress test to when you took it today it's gone down quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay and you’re not on any medications right?
PATIENT: For that, no.
DOCTOR: Do you have anxiety?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Seems to [REDACTED] for that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And another thing is the weight gain.  The last four months I've put on an average of about nine pounds a month.
DOCTOR: That.
PATIENT: I was going to talk to somebody today or I was gonna talk to you is I can get the note.  I want to go to the gym but if it's too taxing, if you could give me a little kick start or something with some water pills or uh a diuretic or something I mean.
DOCTOR: You know mostly [REDACTED] and that might not be the appropriate thing to do.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let's uh, I'll kind of talk to you a little bit more about that.  Let's see so you're past medical, you said you had the borderline hypertension, you had L4-L5 disk, you've had the kidney stones, you had the appendectomy and um any kind of cholesterol problems, nothing like that?

DOCTOR: And you haven't done any drug use?
PATIENT: In the past yeah.

DOCTOR: Any family history of illnesses or anything?
PATIENT: Well my mother passed away of lymphoma uh back in September but that was, she was taking some medicine uh Humira and one of the side effects was that it could cause lymphoma.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So when they found out she was already in the late stage for it.  Uh my dad passed away um in 2001 um, oh it's the one where it attacks your bones um I can't think of the name, it's weird.  It basically turns your bones porous um I forget the name of it now.

DOCTOR: No diabetes?
PATIENT: No uh well, I got a cousin that had it but you know I don't keep much in touch with him.  I think it's because of his weight, he's up there.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And uh let's go back to you then. I need to ask, you were telling me how do you feel today actually?  Any concerns you want to bring up today or just kind of establish care and talk about these things.

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um and you know for a couple of weeks before that I would, my hands would go numb right from the elbow to the fingertips.
DOCTOR: Oh is that right.
PATIENT: If I'm in a certain position, let's say I'm driving and my arm's this way it would do it and then I'd have to either lower my arm.
DOCTOR: If you lowered it, it would go away.
PATIENT: Yeah it would be fine or if I'd sit you know and I'd put my hand like this.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Then it would go numb.  Uh.
DOCTOR: That was only for those two weeks?
PATIENT: Uh for about two weeks beforehand and then once I started having those pains it would still do it during those while I was having the chest pain but after that, excuse me I'm fine now.
DOCTOR: You haven’t had it...
PATIENT: I haven’t had it since.
DOCTOR: So the chest pain went it came on, was it like a pressure sensation?
PATIENT: No it was a sharp pain, sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Left side you said.

DOCTOR: Did it seem like your heart was racing or anything?
PATIENT: Uh, once or twice I felt it was pumping really hard and it almost felt like it was an irregular heartbeat or something.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh but it didn't last long.  Uh I didn't, I was so freaked out about it when it happened that uh I really didn't focus on I mean my heartbeat or anything like that, I was more freaked out than anything.
DOCTOR: I gotcha.  And then any sweats or anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And then how long would you say that [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Uh, within five minutes, sometimes half an hour.
DOCTOR: Five minutes to half an hour.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And uh how many were you having.
PATIENT: Uh I had pains for about a week uh sometimes it was; when I was alone it would be like one time a day otherwise it would be a bunch of them every day.
DOCTOR: So it varies.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] Have you felt better since you left the ER [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Um I was having just a tinge uh yesterday, just like a little you know just kind of a little minor, it’s there. Um but really right after the stress test I think,  once or twice more I think I had them and that was it.
DOCTOR: After you just go out and walk around do you have any trouble breathing at all?
PATIENT: No um.  Right after, right after when I started walking when the weather was still good.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Before this cold snap, I was trying to walk about a mile and a half, two miles a day.  Um for the first two days I'd walk about a mile, mile and a half and I was kind like out of breath and hurting but at the end of the week I was walking two miles um at a good pace with no problems.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] all about your conditioning.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Did you get that chest pain after you walked?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then [REDACTED] any fevers or chills right now?
PATIENT: No, not right now.
DOCTOR: And uh any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Yes but I think it's a byproduct of the medicine I'm taking.

DOCTOR: Okay.  So you're [REDACTED].  What color is it?
PATIENT: What color [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Does it have [REDACTED] odor to it?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh it's different than usual yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  That started on the same day or?
PATIENT: Yeah pretty much or half a day after, 10 hours after or a couple hours after.
DOCTOR: Clindamycin can cause diarrhea as a side effect.  That can also cause like a bacterial super infection.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that's something to watch out for.  This sounds more like the diarrhea is a side effect from the antibiotic and not the other one.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] you're having a lot of this diarrhea, you find you get fevers and chills I think you should come [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then uh having the runny nose.
PATIENT: It's not uh, it's never been runny, it's just stuffy uh but it's been a lot better.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Any dizziness?
PATIENT: Um no not really.
DOCTOR: And then any chest pain right now?
PATIENT: Not right now.  I had a little bit last night.
DOCTOR: It was the same thing that you were talking about?
PATIENT: Yeah but not as strong and it didn't last as long and that's basically the first time I felt it and a couple of days but before it was happening every day.
DOCTOR: Any swelling or redness of your legs?
PATIENT: Um it's hard to tell with all this weight gain.  I mean I'm gaining weight so fast uh no nothing out of the ordinary.
DOCTOR: And when you've been gaining weight over how long?
PATIENT: Um from October to now I've put on about 40 pounds.
DOCTOR: Why do you think that is?
PATIENT: I don't know uh well I mean I've been at the job doing what I'm doing now since March.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh and I don't know what it is from uh October to now I don't know why all of a sudden a big weight gain.  I was pretty much steady.  I've always been between 205 and 220, pretty much my entire adult life.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Ever since I got out of the military uh and it's just ballooned.  I'm not eating as much.  I only eat basically two meals a day um but I mean it gets winter and I'm not getting out and doing as much but.
DOCTOR: Any swollen [REDACTED] they’re hot and you’re cold.
PATIENT: I'm usually the other way around.  Usually I always drive with the windows [REDACTED] open.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any problems with urination?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any problems breathing?
PATIENT: Uh, right since I've been here yeah, I'm getting a little more stuffy but I've been really, really good since.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  You're not wheezing or anything like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Well let's see, let me see what lab tests [REDACTED].  Your blood work looks pretty good. [REDACTED].  Yeah I think we need to check your cholesterol and that's up there pretty high.  It's high but for someone with no risk factors we definitely not horrendous.  So we might want to try to get that down with the weight loss start with that and see if it helps okay.  We'll have to talk a little more about that, what we may want to do is check a couple more labs.
PATIENT: And I wanted to ask when I came in this time with the headaches.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The sinus infection my wife suggested I ask the doctor [REDACTED] cause when I come in for any type of blood work I do have them checked.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Is that hepatitis B?
PATIENT: She has C and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh, yeah we don't have any C here, the tests are hepatitis B and that one you don't have.  But if you want we can [REDACTED], you want the test?  [REDACTED].  The one thing to worry about with weight gain sometimes is your thyroid.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And see if everything is normal.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let me have you sit up here and I'll listen to your chest.
PATIENT: You want the sweatshirt off?
DOCTOR: I'll have you pull it up if that's okay.  [REDACTED].  Say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] started this treatment [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me.  [REDACTED].  Push against me now, good.  Can you look up for me, lean back good?  Now can you [REDACTED].  [REDACTED].  Close your eyes [REDACTED].  Good.  [REDACTED].  You still getting that numbness and tingling in here?
PATIENT: Uh-huh, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay [REDACTED].  Can you do this for me?  Any problems?  [REDACTED].  Any problem with this?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me go talk to my supervisor [REDACTED] and uh we just need to [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now one thing I should tell you about is the MOVE Program and we'll probably recommend that anyway, that's obviously what we do.  That's kind of the local gym here and we help you out with [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well I was looking at joining a gym.  I mean I'm really uh, I've been really, really, really worried about my weight.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Um and I was even looking to you know like find a gym.  I think there's one on 18th street close to my house.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um I really, I've been trying to talk my daughter into and I think she's finally agreed to join with me but if I could do that here that’s fine too.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'll see if that helps you out.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Uh one other question um now this is probably due to age but within the last year my eyes have really been getting bad.  I was wondering if I could [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I could put in for an eye appointment okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  64:45  DOCTOR IN:  73:12)
DOCTOR: Alright.  So we were talking about it.  I think what we'll do is the you know some of the things that we talked about causing the weight gain.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Things to worry about would be the thyroid or adrenal problems.  Uh [REDACTED] some sort of [REDACTED] for labs for [REDACTED] and then your thyroid function studies [REDACTED].  What I think you could do is uh like I said we can try that MOVE Program.  [REDACTED] weight gain [REDACTED].  That would be more [REDACTED] okay.  So we'll do that.  We'll send you to the MOVE Program and then we'll see you start losing weight and we'll have you come back and we'll check it [REDACTED] every week, make sure you're checking your weight and then we'll have you come back in a month to see if there's any change at all okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I also want to check up on your [REDACTED] so that's why we'll have you come back.
PATIENT: Where is this gym located.
DOCTOR: Yeah so the MOVE Program, the nice thing about it is it's not just a gym but you'll have someone that works with you there to recommend exercises and there’s an intake nurse [REDACTED] do that right now [REDACTED] just before we do that I do also want to get some stool studies from you.  That diarrhea that you're having, even though it just started and it could be directly from the antibiotic but [REDACTED] I was telling you about it could be the other part of it. Let’s make sure that’s not what it is.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: ‘Cuz if that’s the case, we’ll put you on another antibiotics.  Okay.
PATIENT: Do you just want to know the color or I mean.
DOCTOR: No, no, what they do is they check it for that bacteria.  Okay.  My feeling is that it’s going to be negative.  But if it is positive then we'll put you on something different.  Is this the right number to call you at, NUMBER.
PATIENT: No I changed it.  NUMBER.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] if that other number doesn’t exist [REDACTED]  Alright let's take you over to.
PATIENT: Leave my stuff here?
DOCTOR: Uh no let's take it with you, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Leave from here?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I'll give you that.  Okay on the way out just check out and they'll give you an appointment for one month from now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Do you know where this MOVE Program is?
DOCTOR: Yeah it’s right across over there.
PATIENT: Oh okay so it’s in the hospital here?
