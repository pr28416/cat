DOCTOR: Um, last week sometime.
PATIENT: Probably still in Florida because I got back on Sunday.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Yeah it was uh the 2nd.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Last week.  Um, so what they saw on the study was that they didn't, they didn't see any source of bleeding at all.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Which was good and no, nothing that, I think from their notes it was a little bit of a bad prep, meaning you weren't totally clean.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So they couldn't see everything um but you know the whole reason that we were doing it was because your hemoglobin, cause your red blood cell count was low.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And we thought maybe you were bleeding from somewhere.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But the most recent labs we have look great.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I don't think that we need anything else more done, we'll just keep watching it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: To make sure you don't go down again.  Um and if, you know if that starts to happen again then we could probably get the study done again.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
