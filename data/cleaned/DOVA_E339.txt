DOCTOR: PATIENT?  Okay, how's it going?
PATIENT: Okay.  I'm fine.
DOCTOR: The last time you came in, you had some dizziness.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And they gave you two liters of fluid.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Downstairs in the Emergency Room.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How are things going now?
PATIENT: Pretty good, every now and then I get a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Sometimes I get up too much and too fast.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then you know, almost all the medications I'm taking say could cause dizziness.
DOCTOR: Yeah but they just put that stuff on there, to cover their butt.  Your blood pressure is a little bit on the lower side.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Yeah you're pretty well set.  The quetiapine I think can cause dizziness.  Okay.  How's the Parkinson's medication going?
PATIENT: Alright.  I don't know how, what it's supposed to do for me you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Sometimes I suck on my teeth, if I don't pay attention I do it you know.
DOCTOR: And do you have a tremor?  Did you ever have a tremor?  No.
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Never did.
DOCTOR: Who said you had Parkinson's?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Who said that you had Parkinson's?  Who diagnosed you?
PATIENT: DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Here okay.
PATIENT: He said symptoms.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  So then you worked with DOCTOR.  You're not feeling um dizzy or anything.
PATIENT: Uh uh.  Sometimes you know I’m doing too much around the house cause I'm home all day and my daughter's working, I'll cook and I'll clean and I'm mopping or vacuuming and I may get a little bit dizzy but that's it.  It's that my appetite seems really [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I'm 180.  In 1953 when I got out of the service I was 175, so in 50 years I gained five pounds.  I don't think that's too bad.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] significant.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: And you're not falling down with the dizziness?
PATIENT: No.  A couple times I tripped you know.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I missed that road and not paying attention.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Cause I've been slowing down on that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Anything else going on?
PATIENT: Nothing.
DOCTOR: I think I brought you in mainly to make sure that.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: I think I brought you in mainly, we just saw you in February right?  I brought you in mainly to make sure that that dizziness had resolved.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, well it happens but not where it bothers me, scare me.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The last time was a little different?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  I uh I'm having a little more trouble with my prostate.
DOCTOR: Okay so that’s one of the questions that the VA wants us to ask you about is urination.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you have weak urine and do you pee accidentally or anything like that?
PATIENT: No it's just that uh I have to go more, more frequently and that you know I have two [REDACTED] one leads to the other so sometimes I get a little pain down there and I don't know if it's from the tube.
DOCTOR: What tube?
PATIENT: From the prostate to my bladder.
DOCTOR: You have a tube down there?
PATIENT: Yeah well you getting any blood flow here so they tapped in.
DOCTOR: Oh that, yeah.  No that should have nothing to do with it.
PATIENT: Hmm.  But I'm getting discomfort down here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay.  Uh how often do you urinate at night?
PATIENT: A day, now  a day I couldn't count it but at night at least three times in the night.
DOCTOR: You get up to go urinate?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And um are you able to completely empty your bladder?
PATIENT: Sometimes, not always.  I feel like uh you know I could but I get tired of standing there and give up.
DOCTOR: Okay so you have some problems emptying your bladder okay.
PATIENT: I feel like I haven't emptied it you know.
DOCTOR: Okay right and then when you um, what was I doing, when you do urinate is the stream weak?
PATIENT: It's different you know.  It'll be you know pretty good and then it'll slow down, be weak and stop and then start again.
DOCTOR: And how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Months.  And I drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And my daughters drive me nuts with Gatorade and I see in the paper and on TV Gatorade isn't all that good.  They say Pedialyte is better.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: That they give to the kids.
DOCTOR: Oh Gatorade has a lot of sugar in it.
PATIENT: Not Gatorade 2.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Gatorade 2 has about 5 mg.
DOCTOR: Oh is that right.
PATIENT: The other ones are like 19 or something like that.
DOCTOR: Yeah it has a lot of sugar.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah so I make sure.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Gatorade 2 but then again most of the time I try to stay away from sugar and I'm constantly in that cookie bowl.  I'm worse than my grandkids.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and then you're on medication for the prostate, did you know that?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Finasteride.
DOCTOR: Finasteride, good and you take that every day?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I was on two.
DOCTOR: Yeah you used to be on two.
PATIENT: And they cut the one back, uh Flomax cause they thought that was giving me the dizziness.
DOCTOR: Yeah, we could have probably done Flomax again.
PATIENT: And I think we should.
DOCTOR: Does that make it better?
PATIENT: Yeah I thought it was better with Flomax.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah all those medications are going to cause a little bit but I'll talk to my boss about it.
PATIENT: I mean if.
DOCTOR: We could try it.
PATIENT: If I start taking it and I get dizzy then let’s stop, we know that was the problem.
DOCTOR: Right, right.  Have you ever had a prostate biopsy?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh your symptoms.
PATIENT: A long time ago I had a biopsy.
DOCTOR: And that was negative?
PATIENT: There was a cut, there was a lump there and I don't know how many samples he took but I was ready to come off that table.  It was painful.
DOCTOR: Let's see and you're supposed to, hmm they scheduled to see the urologist.
PATIENT: I didn't.
DOCTOR: You're seeing Urology May 25th.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So what we could do, oh no April 2nd, you'll see Urology April 2nd.  So what we could do is try [REDACTED] so try the Flomax again.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you'll follow up with them in May and they can tell you what to do with it.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay um well let me check your blood pressure again.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Have a seat up there.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's.
PATIENT: I just came.
DOCTOR: The way you walk.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Like this, that's called a shuffled gait.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that happens with Parkinson's.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Cause otherwise, usually.
PATIENT: Last time you know.
DOCTOR: You don't have a tremor.
PATIENT: No, no.  Seems like when I get up that's when I start.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then every day I walk outside.
DOCTOR: Yeah you have a little bit of cog, and then you also have this thing called, maybe you do, a little bit, not that bad.  You also have this thing called cogwheeling rigidity
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So it's in people who have pretty bad Parkinson's and [REDACTED] rigidity.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Which I don't think you have but you're on medication so maybe you did before, did you do this?  I thought I felt [REDACTED] second.  [REDACTED] neurologist.  I think you may have a little bit of it.
PATIENT: And this elbow has arthritis in the morning and sometimes it [REDACTED] me.
DOCTOR: Oh, do you take anything for it?
PATIENT: No.  I have to see the arthritis doctor sometime in the next.
DOCTOR: Do you take Tylenol?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: You can take Tylenol.
PATIENT: Yeah but I'm not, I'm not taking any now.
DOCTOR: Take some Tylenol for the pain.  I can order it for you.  You can take a gram, up to a gram a every six hours.
PATIENT: Yeah that would help.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Especially in the morning when I wake up.
DOCTOR: I can order it [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But sometimes it hurts when I sleep on it you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And that makes it worse.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And it seems like the right elbow is always colder than the left.  Why is that?
DOCTOR: Um, that I don't know.  It could be um the same artery disease that you have in your legs and your heart; it could be in the arms too.
PATIENT: And then I was feeling pretty good, I was in Arizona for two weeks.  I come back the night before last and just as soon as I get out there it's cold.  It was 58 degrees in Las Vegas.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause I'm going to [REDACTED] from there and it was 81 in Chicago.
DOCTOR: Isn't that funny?
PATIENT: It's crazy.
DOCTOR: It is.  I was actually, I was in [REDACTED] and I was flying back and I had to land in Miami before I got to Chicago and it was warmer in Chicago last weekend than it was here and I was in Miami.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Weird.  Now it's starting to cool down.
PATIENT: And I was in; I was in Portal City which is one of the warmest.  It's only 10 minutes from the Needles Point.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I couldn't believe the temperature drop and my daughter yes its fine [REDACTED].  As soon as I get there it drops.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Okay and then relax your arm as much as you can, try to bend your elbow, just like that, perfect.  You're blood pressure is hard to feel.
PATIENT: Hmm.  That arm is always lower than this arm.  Why I don't know.  I think there's some blockage the doctor said.
DOCTOR: I'll try that arm.
PATIENT: What was it?
DOCTOR: That's 150 too.  Yeah there was a big difference.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So it was 108/68 on this side and I couldn't even hear it on that side.
PATIENT: Yeah they tell me there's a blockage.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: When I had my heart attack, why didn't I tell them and I said how could I tell you cause I didn't know.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And which arm is cold?
PATIENT: It's the elbow.
DOCTOR: Oh the elbow's cold, but this arm is okay.  Hmm.  There you go.  Yeah it's easier to feel a pulse on this side.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You must have a blockage in that arm.
PATIENT: That's what he said but.
DOCTOR: I don't think there's any, [REDACTED] this means, pink means blood flow.  But that doesn't that needs to be done, it's something to watch.  Did you used to be a drinker?
PATIENT: Used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I quit 32 years ago February 19th.
DOCTOR: Wow, [REDACTED] huh.  Keep standing up.  Okay, just watch out, if you ever notice this arm getting cool or something?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That means there may be you know a really bad blockage in here, maybe permanent blockage that we have to intervene on and if it gets cool you go straight to the hospital okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Any numbness or tingling or anything like that in the arms go straight to the hospital and tell them that you know.
PATIENT: Yeah the blockage.
DOCTOR: That you may have a blockage in this arm.  And they'll be able to feel the pulses are not equal.
PATIENT: The same with that shuffling thing.
DOCTOR: You can stand up.
PATIENT: When I first get up that happens.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: To walk.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah.
PATIENT: I'll get my cane, I go outside and I start walking normal, no shuffle and it seems like it only happens when I get up or when I have back pain.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh back pain can cause it.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Most of the time it's the back pain.
DOCTOR: Do you have any or are you feeling dizzy right now?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Take some deep breaths in and out for me.  Good.  Okay let’s take your blood pressure standing up.  Let's stand over here and then turn around.  This will be easier.  I think I'll get you to take this off, I think you can take it off.  Alright, oops.  [REDACTED].  Okay, the same [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Now the other one.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] huh.

DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And another pill and I [REDACTED].   So I noticed that when I took the a couple of drinks that it relaxed me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.

DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I had to give that up.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So [REDACTED] about that.
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: I'm going to talk to my boss about what he thinks about starting on the tamsulosin and making sure that's okay.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: I'm willing to try it uh and I do want you to watch your blood pressures.  And then we may bring you back in to see the nurse to check your blood pressures again.  Do you live far away?

PATIENT: Uh so I start taking today or tomorrow or?
DOCTOR: Well let me ask and he may say that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I just have to run this by him; he may say I can't do that.
PATIENT: And it was just one tablet.
DOCTOR: Yeah, take one cause it's the same dose every time.  I'll be right back.
(DOCTOR OUT:  86:40  DOCTOR IN:  94:10)
DOCTOR: Okay, so the boss is okay with starting the Flomax and I'll order that for you.  And we need just need to be diligent because it lowers your blood pressure you know.
