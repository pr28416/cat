PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We'll say the last three, four weeks, what's the highest it's been?
PATIENT: Something like 160.
DOCTOR: Okay.  That's I mean, you know that's high but that's not.
PATIENT: 150.
DOCTOR: I've heard a lot worse than that today.
PATIENT: 165.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I haven't uh; I took my medicine this morning.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I haven't eaten just in case you want to test.
DOCTOR: Good, yeah well that will help a lot.  Do you remember, I know it's hard to say, over the summer when they drew your blood were you fasting at that time or had you had something to eat then?
PATIENT: I probably had something to eat because the doctor you know he got kind of upset at me because I ate.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Cause yeah your numbers were.
PATIENT: Cause that's why I didn't eat this time.
DOCTOR: Good, great.
PATIENT: And I need something quick, too.
DOCTOR: What's the lowest your readings have been?
PATIENT: Uh the lowest that I've seen was when um.
DOCTOR: In the last three weeks let's say?
PATIENT: Oh the last three weeks.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I had 110.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's when I start shaking and stuff.
DOCTOR: So even at 110 you feel a little weak.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.  So do you usually take some juice or something like that to get better pretty quick?
PATIENT: Yes.  I take a little juice or you know I keep a lot of hard candy just in case you know.
DOCTOR: Well that's good.
PATIENT: Yeah I uh get me some juice or something with sugar in it.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Um as far as your gout, when was the last time you had a flare-up of your gout?
PATIENT: Oh it's been many years.  I would say it's been three, four or five years.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But they [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  You just couldn't ever be a sandal model huh?
PATIENT: No, not too much no.  Um there is one thing I need you to look up.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I think there's some swelling in this leg.
DOCTOR: Okay [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.  It's really swollen there.
DOCTOR: How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: About two or three weeks.
DOCTOR: How did you get this scar here?
PATIENT: Oh well no that was a long time ago when I was walking, I was walking through like a hallway, I was supposed to step up, I didn't step up and I hit it so yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah and doctor and this has happened for a long time and I came to the doctor about a year ago.  See how that one's bigger than that one?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I came to the doctor about a year ago; I came here about a year ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause I was concerned about pain in my legs in here and here you know when I walk and so they sent me upstairs to take a test and everything so they didn't see anything wrong but if I walk for a period of time, like two or three blocks, I get pain in my legs here and here and it still happens.  And uh so I was watching television.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Two or three weeks ago.  I was watching television two or three weeks ago and I saw a commercial about Plavix it was talking about because it could be uh something called periphery artery disease.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I mean so but you walk, you go two, three blocks, it starts hurting, if you stop it gets better?
PATIENT: Right and it does get better, if I stop and rest its fine then I walk a little while longer.
DOCTOR: When was it that you had that test done?
PATIENT: I'm gonna say roughly a year ago.
DOCTOR: And what did they do, do you remember?
PATIENT: Uh they took me up there and put me on the table and then they hooked all these things on my legs.  Well what did they do?
DOCTOR: You know let me, give me just a second I'll look right here and see what I can find.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You can put [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay thank you doctor.
DOCTOR: Yeah that left nail do you think that's infected or you just?
PATIENT: No it's been like that ever since I was a baby.
DOCTOR: It's been dark that long?
PATIENT: It's been like that forever.
DOCTOR: Alright then I won't bother that.
PATIENT: Yeah it is.  It's been like that since I was a little boy.  You don't see anything?
DOCTOR: Was that before or after you were in the hospital for pneumonia?
PATIENT: It was before.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It was before I was in the hospital for pneumonia.  They said there was nothing wrong with it but you know the pain still persists so the doctor told me, what the doctor told me to do was just walk as much as you can and then it'll go away.
DOCTOR: And is it one leg more than the other?
PATIENT: No actually it's both of them.
DOCTOR: Cause it wasn't completely normal.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No and I'm sorry if somebody told you that but.
PATIENT: But why didn't they do anything about it?
DOCTOR: Um I mean really at first the best thing to do is to try and get your blood pressure and your diabetes under control.  Those are the two best things you can do for it but if you're going two or three blocks now and you're a young man, I mean that's something we need to.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: If you don't mind I would go ahead and repeat that test.
PATIENT: You don't want to repeat it?
DOCTOR: No I would.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: I would want to repeat that test and depending on what that shows I might have to have you talk with the vascular surgeons, the doctors that deal with the blood vessels.  Sometimes if there's, you know just like people can get a narrowing of the blood vessel in their heart, you can get a narrowing of the blood vessel that goes to your leg.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Sometimes it's just as simple as them using a little balloon or a stent to open up the blood vessel and that'll make a big difference for you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I work at a shipping and receiving department on the dock at the University of Chicago.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  So you're on your feet a lot so you're maybe not walking that far right?
PATIENT: I'm on my feet quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm on my feet out of eight hours I may be on my feet around six of them.  I'm not doing a lot of long walking but you know how a college campus is, you gonna have to walk.
DOCTOR: Yeah, [REDACTED] yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah okay so like I may be putting some boxes on the cart to deliver to another building two or three blocks away.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I will take it for a walk.
DOCTOR: Alright, yeah we definitely need to deal with this.
PATIENT: And so you know [REDACTED] and you know you could probably look to see if the doctors that I talked to, about he told me you know you just keep walking and you know it'll go away.  You know I him I'll walk as much as I can but sometimes I take the stairs.
DOCTOR: And that I mean walking does generally help it actually.  Um it may seem counter intuitive to do something that causes pain but it does, you know little by little help but I mean it sounds like it’s something you already do.  I mean you're not a person who sits on the couch all day every day.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So and that’s obvious.  Um so we definitely need to do that.  The other thing we need to do now that you're 50 years old is get a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had one of those?
PATIENT: I don't think so.  If I had one it was a very, very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So what that is um, sorry if you already know but basically uh it's to look for any kind of polyps.
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had one of those.
DOCTOR: Okay and the reason we do it is it's like a screening for cancer um.  Everybody that turns 50 gets it, male or female um.
PATIENT: Okay [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh and the thought is that these little polyps they start out as simple things but they can turn into cancer if they're in there for a long time.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: They try to catch them early, remove them and they never turn into cancer.
PATIENT: Okay do it then.
DOCTOR: So we'll set you up for that.  Any diseases that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um heart disease runs in you know on my father's side of the family.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What age, when did it start affecting people on his side of the family?
PATIENT: It started to affect him when he was; I think he was in his early 50s when he had about a double bypass, heart problems.
DOCTOR: Was he diabetic?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No alright.
PATIENT: I'm the only one in my family with diabetes.
DOCTOR: You're the lucky one huh?
PATIENT: I must be.
DOCTOR: Alright um, so we'll set you up for the colonoscopy.  Do you take an aspirin every day?
PATIENT: I used to but I don't.  The reason why I don't is because uh you know DOCTOR used to prescribe it to me and when he stopped prescribing it, I thought I didn't need it anymore so I stopped taking it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm going to recommend you start taking a baby aspirin again every day, 81 mg.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um I'm happy to prescribe it for you here but if I prescribed it for you here they're gonna charge you $8 a bottle.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You can buy it at Walgreens, it’s two dollars.
PATIENT: Okay yeah, yeah, I'll pick up two of them.  I got to get 81 mg?
DOCTOR: Yeah, it'll say like baby aspirin on there.  It's a standard dose but you don't need the full dose.  You don't need the 325 mg.  Those are the two strengths.  You need the lower strength.
PATIENT: 81 mg.
DOCTOR: That's right.
PATIENT: Okay I'll remember that, I'll go buy it.
DOCTOR: Alright.  I want to listen to your heart and your lungs here real quick.  Take a deep breath.  Do you ever get any belly pain?
PATIENT: No, but I'm hungry.
DOCTOR: That's normal.  So you're hungry right now.
PATIENT: Uh yes, I’m starving.
DOCTOR: Um do you smoke?
PATIENT: Unfortunately I do.  I quit but then when I quit drinking I started back smoking again.  It was kind of hard to do both of them at the same time, got to something that's wrong you know.  So I'm going to quit them again.
DOCTOR: How much are you smoking right now?
PATIENT: Approximately a pack a day.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How long have you been smoking?
PATIENT: Well um, I'm 50 years old I been smoking since I was about 15.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and before you stopped drinking how much were you smoking or how much were you drinking?
PATIENT: I was drinking about a pint of maybe whiskey a week.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And maybe two six-packs of beer a week.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um well did the drinking become a problem for you or why did you quit?
PATIENT: Uh for health reasons sir.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh with the diabetes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: All that and it's not good for you [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um, absolutely, anything else I mean cocaine, marijuana, heroin?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright well let me go talk with the doctor I'm working with but we'll refill these meds for you so you can pick them up here today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll put in for the blood work so you can get that done and get some lunch and then um.
PATIENT: You mean get the blood work done today?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah cause you said you hadn't eaten anything right?
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: So yeah and the best thing to do is actually check in at the Pharmacy, go get the blood work and when you're done with the blood work they should be close to done with your plls.
PATIENT: Then I have to come back and see you?
DOCTOR: Uh no.  I will um, I will probably have you come back with the pharmacist in a few weeks to go over the lab results and see if you need to change anything for your diabetes medicines.
PATIENT: Alright and also uh, you're going to book me for that test that you said.
DOCTOR: I'm going to send you for a repeat of that test as well as for the colonoscopy.
PATIENT: Not today though.
DOCTOR: I'll put in the order today but the test wouldn't be done today.
PATIENT: That's what I was asking.
DOCTOR: Yeah, no they'll call you to arrange that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Give me just a minute; let me talk with the doctor I'm working with alright.
PATIENT: Alright.  Oh, sir.

DOCTOR: Sure, yeah.

DOCTOR: We'll get you set up here.  I'm just gonna give you this information um for if you're interested for weight loss we have a clinic here called the MOVE Program.

DOCTOR: Well if you want I can put it in for today or if you want to think about it.
PATIENT: Yeah let me uh, let me think about it and then the next time I come I could make a decision.
DOCTOR: Okay. And the other thing, with your diabetes, we'd like you to see the eye doctor um every year and it doesn't look like you've seen them recently.
