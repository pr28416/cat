DOCTOR: Are you PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes I am.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You bet.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: As a matter of fact yes.  I was here three years ago for testing for agent organe.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh I haven't been back since but now I'm on your records because to make a long story short, [REDACTED] nothing really hurts okay but what I'm trying to do is get myself moved over to the VA because my wife is retiring at the end of this week and by the end of the month I will be without prescriptions.
DOCTOR: Right okay.  Sounds fine.
PATIENT: Now I do have a list of things that I do take in case you want to see them.
DOCTOR: Now um, do have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: I do.  I have this [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Are you going to transfer everything here or are you going to keep your outside primary care physician?
PATIENT: Yeah that's why I'm here.  I really am between a rock and a hard place.  I've known this guy for 33 years.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: He's a good guy.  My wife likes to take to to him okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'll do whatever I have to do in order to get covered on the VA I'll do it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The only reason I want to know specific, I know who's going to be coordinating your health care.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Cause it's important that if you want just one person, so whether that's us or the other primary care physician that's up to you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I want you to just have one person just so it's not two people putting in orders.
PATIENT: I can do that.  So what if I go to him for whatever reason and he gives me a prescription?
DOCTOR: You can get it here.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: Then you're primary.  If I'm understanding about this, you plan is to come here from your physician and come here for medications which other people have done as well.
PATIENT: Okay, let's try that, it'll work.  Why don't we go that way.
DOCTOR: And if you want to transition your care here then let us know.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Exactly, you read my mind, right in the right direction.
DOCTOR: Um alright, let me get some of the history from you just so that.
PATIENT: Okay.

PATIENT: [REDACTED] yeah.
DOCTOR: So what medications are you taking?
PATIENT: Okay I take Diovan for high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay and how much of the Diovan?
PATIENT: One 160 mg once a day.  That's it right there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay and why are you taking the Diovan as opposed to did you try lisinopril in the past and or
PATIENT: That's what we did.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Just because so this is a sister medication.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um for the [REDACTED] can be resistive to other medicines.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Usually people do well on the other medications [REDACTED] what happens.  Did you ever have a cough with the medication and he said stop that?
PATIENT: No I had something before Diovan.  To be honest with you it was so long ago I don't remember but the Diovan has been working for me, knock on wood, and I'm not wanting to give it up, that's why I'm on it.
DOCTOR: Oh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay and that's his number right there.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And where [REDACTED]
PATIENT: I'm not sure I can remember.  [REDACTED] I just have to get my file and I just pulled them out so I could give you the information that I use.
DOCTOR: So I can see that right?
PATIENT: He’s in Chicago on Foster Avenue [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yes, this is the one.
PATIENT: Same one?
DOCTOR: You let me know.
PATIENT: But some of them could be different, I just want to make sure that I remember to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED] absolutely.  Okay, so we got the Diovan and what else are you taking?
PATIENT: Which is the choledterol [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: For cholesterol and DOCTOR prescribed the Lipitor.
DOCTOR: Okay and you're taking vitamin C.
PATIENT: Vitamin C yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] muscle relaxer, sometimes my back kind of [REDACTED] up.
DOCTOR: How long do you take that?
PATIENT: Uh only when my back goes out.  Knock on wood, it been for a long time so, probably within the last eight months or nine months.  I only take it when I need it.  I don't take medications if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.
PATIENT: And the last thing is I take eye drops, [REDACTED].  I have [REDACTED].  I don't think I have [REDACTED] small container [REDACTED]. I don’t have a print out.
DOCTOR: Okay.  No problem.  Now okay.  And this goes in both eyes?
PATIENT: Yes one drop in each eye just once a day.
DOCTOR: Okay and that was the last one.
PATIENT: That's it.
DOCTOR: What's this one for?
PATIENT: Glaoucoma.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I go through an ophthalmologist in Riverside.
DOCTOR: Alrighty.  Okay.  Anything else or is that it?
PATIENT: No that's it.  That’s way too much.
DOCTOR: Yeah some people take a lot more.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Not that I know of.  No.  Like, sulfa or anything like that no.
DOCTOR: Okay um and it as far as your family history goes, are your parents still alive?
PATIENT: No mother's dead and father's dead.
DOCTOR: May I asked what they passed from?
PATIENT: Uh my father, I think he died of a heart attack.  He was 73 years old.  He had open heart surgery when he was 60.  He had two bypasses.  He smoked a lot, he drank a lot and he did a lot of things that he shouldn't have done and uh, so you know when his time came he went to the hospital to be checked out and he was at Loyola.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then [REDACTED] someplace and [REDACTED].  He was in for observation and the next thing he died of a heart attack and my mother died at 86, old age.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: My mother she was a type 2 diabetic.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I never knew her to take any kind of heart medications.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She took eye drops for probably glaucoma but.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you have any brothers or sisters?
PATIENT: I have two sisters.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do they have they take any medications?
PATIENT: My sister SISTER she had cancer of the lung way back when.  She's fine now and she had something with her hip and you know all kinds of things and I don't know what kinds of medications she's on, God only knows.
DOCTOR: And the other one?
PATIENT: My other sister she takes probably an aspirin a year and she's on very minimal, maybe eye drops [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Very limited but she smokes, that's the only problem she's got.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Did you have children?
PATIENT: I have one.  He's going to be 40 the 26th of this month.
DOCTOR: And [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And who lives with you?
PATIENT: My wife.
DOCTOR: And do you um do you work sir?
PATIENT: No I'm retired.  I've been retired almost four years in June.
DOCTOR: And what did you used to do?
PATIENT: Inside sales. Phone jockey.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Tell them what they want to hear.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke?
PATIENT: No I do not.  I quit about 20 years ago.  Do I drink; you know occasional cocktail, scotch.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And any other [REDACTED] uh like illicit drugs or [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No, no, no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  This is just a laundry list of questions [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Fine.
DOCTOR: Any weight changes?
PATIENT: No.  In a matter of fact, I was doing better well until Christmas you know, I was losing eight or nine pounds in August.
DOCTOR: I see.
PATIENT: The fluid.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any chest pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Or palpitations or racing of the heart?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And um, how many pillows do you sleep on at night?
PATIENT: That's a good question.  You know when I was in the Navy they gave me pillows and I'd get down almost to the mattress.  I only sleep on one pillow and I hug the other and I have one between my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The reason I do that is because it helps my back.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's a knee pillow.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The other pillow I hold to and my [REDACTED] but and then I sleep on one pillow.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And you don't wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air?
PATIENT: Uh no, but once in a while I maybe have a tickle and it doesn't happen every night but it happens from time to time, I think it's just dry air in the bedroom.
DOCTOR: And you'll cough?
PATIENT: Yes, I mean not anything going crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cough a little bit, if I need to I'll get some water and that takes care of and I'll go right back to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay and you cough up any blood?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If I ever do that, I'd be knocking on somebody's door, I don't play games with stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Okay and any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No.  Why am I here then? (Laughs)
DOCTOR: Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And any rashes?
PATIENT: No, but with this crazy weather, but I no.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay. Alright and then as far as um what you've had in the past.  Have you had a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Uh never.
DOCTOR: And why not?
PATIENT: Because my [REDACTED] told me that I probably shouldn't, cause you know if you're over 65, which I am uh you know you should probably go in for it but uh I never, but my primary doctor he finally you know gives me the finger every.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Whether or not, [REDACTED] right now is that everything looks and feels good so he didn't think there was an urgent need for it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you ever done the stool cards?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you do that once a year?
PATIENT: Uh as a matter of fact I just did one not too long ago, probably in July or August.
DOCTOR: Okay and that was normal?
PATIENT: It was fine yeah.
DOCTOR: Has there ever been blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then that’s probably why, you can do either one; you can do the stool cards once a year or get a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: I mean he's a really good guy, very thorough and you know if [REDACTED] knock me out and stick me in the hospital but you know, he told me from Swedish Covenant.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  I understand.  Um has he been checking your blood tests and all?
PATIENT: Oh yeah he checks it probably once a year.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] just so I can have those results as well.  Since we’ll be prescribing the cholesterol medication.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But you know if we’re reaching the goal. And if we’re not, I can always go back to him and say do you think I should go off of it and use this.
PATIENT: Oh okay.  I understand that.
DOCTOR: But just so that we can [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] back to me.
PATIENT: And what if like they are over a certain age, [REDACTED] over a year and then I could get another or no?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Because if you're taking cholesterol medications.
PATIENT: Yes.  You make sure the blood work and everything else to make sure.
DOCTOR: Exactly.  Exactly and that would be helpful to have.
PATIENT: You bet, uh-huh.  That makes sense.
DOCTOR: Um and have you checked your PSA?
PATIENT: Uh yes he does that quite often, [REDACTED].  Now I [REDACTED] people ask, some mean old guy I don't like to see them, I don't want to hear anything about him.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But I do know from the test that I went through this one operation at North Riverside not too long ago and whatever they did they took out a big vial this one time and this other one was piggyback and they keep on taking out vials and I hear a click and [REDACTED].  After a while it’s just kind of[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Makes me go crazy.  So yeah the PSA is one of them.  There are seven things that they check for and that's one of them, that's one of them.
DOCTOR: And did you have flu vaccine?
PATIENT: Yes I did.
DOCTOR: When was that, what month?
PATIENT: Uh let's see, it was getting more cold out, it was at North Riverside and I had just seen my doctor, I went through [REDACTED].  They said it was free but it wasn't free, they put it on Medicare, [REDACTED] it definitely was probably September October.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And do you know when your last tetanus shot was?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Would have been more than ten years ago?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  That would definitely recommend to your doctor be something we'd ask you to get.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And have you had a Pneumovax or the pneumonia shot?
PATIENT: No.  I never had the pneumonia shot, ever in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay.  If this is something that you want to have, you just get one and then you don't need it anymore the rest of your life.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you may consider that.
PATIENT: Oh okay, okay.  That's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] you don't need one.  Okay, why don't we examine you, how about that?  Go ahead and have a seat for me, please.  Do you check your blood pressures at home?
PATIENT: Uh I have one of those wrist things.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What do they usually run?
PATIENT: Uh 120/81, 130, sometimes it gets something crazy like 119/75, you know they fluctuate and my doctor doesn't think it's all that great but you know it keeps me in line.  I think that she had 150/80 but I probably get excited when I'm around new people you know.
DOCTOR: Can you bring your um sleeve up a little bit please.
PATIENT: Bring it up or take it off?
DOCTOR: Um either way I just want to, need to get the blood pressure.
PATIENT: I should have wore a short sleeve today.
DOCTOR: No that's fine.
PATIENT: If that doesn't work I'll take it off.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm going to have you [REDACTED].  Then I'll put the left one on my arm.
PATIENT: How it be hard [REDACTED] your doing.
DOCTOR: Focused and relaxed.  I don't want you; you're holding your arm up.  I want you to drop it.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah.
DOCTOR: Pretty good, 136/88.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Not as high as the nurses reading.
PATIENT: She said 150.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And like you said it can fluctuate.
PATIENT: Yeah, right okay.
DOCTOR: Especially just walking in.
PATIENT: Definitely walking.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] but it's high.
PATIENT: Well at least you know I'm telling the truth.
DOCTOR: Let me take a listen to your heart and breathe normal.  Deep breath in and out good.  Again and out, again out in and out.  Good.  Can you take your glasses off for me.  I'm going to look in your eyes.  Look here at my nose, uh-huh, uh-huh, good.  Open your mouth real big, ah.  You can put your glasses back on.  [REDACTED] push me away; good now push me away with your legs, good.  I want you to look at your ceiling like that, good.  [REDACTED] good.  Go ahead and lie down.  I'll check your abdomen.  There you go.
PATIENT: I'm ticklish.
DOCTOR: You're ticklish.
PATIENT: I'm already laughing.
DOCTOR: I'll try not to tickle you then.  I usually tickle [REDACTED] patients.  Any swelling in the legs?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Good.  I'll help you get up.  [REDACTED].  Alright so now.  The way with the medications, I'm going to start the Diovan.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Before I [REDACTED] some of the medications we don't have on our formulary or it's not in the combo pills and we have to order them separate.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let me see if they have the Diovan, they do.  [REDACTED].  Is that one today?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Do you want it mailed to you or do you want it?
PATIENT: That's a good question uh what's easier.  Are they hard to mail?
DOCTOR: Usually people prefer to have them mailed because.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because to tell you the truth the Pharmacy down here can be backed up.
PATIENT: Okay, a friend of mine comes here quite often and I've seen her a couple of times when I go with her and there's a lot of people and yeah.
DOCTOR: So what I can also do are three months supply with three refills, good for a year.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: And [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's 20/5 [REDACTED]. Or 5/20 it's 5 of the Norvasc and 20 mg on the Lipitor, that's how you get the 5/20.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um but we don't have the [REDACTED] in our formulary.  What we have to do is go from one pills to two pills.
PATIENT: Lipitor and the Norvasc.
DOCTOR: Exactly.  So the Norvasc we'll go with 5.
PATIENT: Go with 5 yeah.
DOCTOR: And [REDACTED] the Lipitor.
PATIENT: 20. 20 mg.
DOCTOR: And then [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Cyclobenzaprine.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].  We don't have that so what we have is pravastatin but I don't know [REDACTED].  And so [REDACTED].  Lipitor is in the same family as pravastatin but Lipitor is a [REDACTED] pravastatin or simvastatin.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So I can give you one of those alternate drugs but it would not be the same[REDACTED] from atorvastatin to pravastatin.
PATIENT: Okay now [REDACTED] I don't know you know.
DOCTOR: We'll order simvastatin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Based on recent studies, [REDACTED] simvastatin.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll order that.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That will take the place of the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Norvasc [REDACTED]
PATIENT: And what do you call the other medicine?
DOCTOR: Simvastatin.
PATIENT: Simvastatin.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Oh the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] yeah 10 mg.
DOCTOR: And how many do you usually have?
PATIENT: Usually we're prescribed 21, a seven day supply three times a day and I never really, I can't remember the last time I took 21.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem.
PATIENT: Uh I'm really bad but I really should finish it up because once my back goes out it gets kind of crooked.
DOCTOR: I understand.
PATIENT: You [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah really rough yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But anyway when it painful I try not to laugh [REDACTED].  She has a good time with it; I tell her one of these days God is going to punish her.
DOCTOR: And the last thing is the eye drops.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Now I don't know if you want to have that [REDACTED].  So I'm gonna have to step out and see what, cause the eyedrops I’m not familiar with, so I need to see what alternatives we can do um instead of the [REDACTED] and I'm going to order those [REDACTED] and be right back okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] the rest of these will be sent right to your house.
