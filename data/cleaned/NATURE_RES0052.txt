DOCTOR: OK, and how about any genetic conditions or congenital conditions in the family?
PATIENT: No, none, none that I know of.
DOCTOR: OK, so the main symptoms are the cough that started two days ago and also you've noticed she's been congested. And sorry, what was the last symptom?
PATIENT: She has this pink eye and she has a cough.
DOCTOR: Yeah, right, that could be conjunctivitis. OK, so at this point we will certainly run some investigations to look into what this could be. It sounds like a viral infectious type of process, especially if it's involving the eyes, nose, and and with a cough. And so we will test with a swab for covid for sure. But it could be something more common, like the common cold. We just need to make sure that we're comprehensive in that with the testing.
PATIENT: That sounds great, thank you.
