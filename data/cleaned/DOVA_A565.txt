DOCTOR: Were you getting your medications at the other hospitals or were you always getting your medications here?

DOCTOR: [REDACTED] prescribe that.
PATIENT: Uh I think it was at St. Margaret's.  I know I sound vague [REDACTED] you know my wife handles a lot of this stuff you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well the, it's I mean I guess as long as you're taking, if you're getting all your medical care here it helps to have you getting them in one place.  You know because it's impossible for you to know some of the things that happen in other hospitals.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But to keep track of what medications they've given you okay so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So the metoprolol we'll do that.

PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The atorvastatin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you can get it out there, oh it looks like you got it recently, you got that on the 24th uh.
PATIENT: I think what probably happened was the doctor prescribed it at 150 mg a day twice a day and I only got the 50 mg so I went right straight through it you know and that's why I'm almost out.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I need enough to make 150 mg a day.
