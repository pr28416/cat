DOCTOR: Oh really?
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Did you take the allopurinol for it?
PATIENT: I ran out of that.
DOCTOR: Did you get the colchicine?

DOCTOR: And you managed the flare completely without using the allopurinol right?
PATIENT: Yes uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Where do normally get the gout?
PATIENT: Uh right big toe.  See in the left.
DOCTOR: Do you have any swelling there?  It's not anywhere in your foot?
PATIENT: Usually it's in the left big toe.  Sometimes it's you know, it moves over to the right foot, seems like in the middle of the foot seems like but mostly it's in the left big toe.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I have a question, your diabetes has not been controlled for a while um, we look at this number called the hemoglobin A1c, we want it here, it was when it was controlled and here it's relatively controlled in ‘05.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But the last one was in the summer was 8.3.  We want it ideally to be less than 7.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Are you checking your blood sugar only once a day or two hours after you eat or before you eat?
PATIENT: Uh-huh you know I just recently started doing the two hours after cause I was doing it like right after I eat or wait an hour after I eat.
DOCTOR: Okay so if you're gonna check it after you've eaten, do it two hours after you eat.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Otherwise check it before you eat and see how its running during the middle of the day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and likely you're only taking metformin right for diabetes?
PATIENT: And glipizide.
DOCTOR: Oh you are taking glipizide.
PATIENT: Yes, I need a refill on that twice a day.
DOCTOR: So how much glipizide?
PATIENT: Uh a tablet and a half.
DOCTOR: 10, 20 mg, 50 mg?
PATIENT: Uh can't remember which one it is.  I know I take a pill and a half a day.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, so you're taking 50 mg.  When did you stop taking that?
PATIENT: I hadn't stopped taking it unless I run out of it.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: Yeah.  When I was here last week they told me to stop taking the colchicine.
DOCTOR: Oh you were taking it pretty consistently?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You were taking the colchicine and allopurinol?
PATIENT: At one point I was.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] So that was stopped.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Colchicine and allopurinol.  Per month or per year how many episodes do you get while on the allopurinol?
PATIENT: Oh man, I'd say about three.
DOCTOR: So that's three episodes a year?
PATIENT: Uh-huh about that.  Sometimes it seems like a little more but.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  These are the ones you take.  [REDACTED] When was the last time you saw an eye doctor?

DOCTOR: Oh I see that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Optometry you saw in September, um.  Did you see the foot doctors recently?
PATIENT: No but I need to.  I was gonna ask to see the orthopedic for my knee you know, the podiatrist about my right heel.
DOCTOR: Okay so the last time you saw Podiatry was a long time ago.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Looks like ‘08.  Do you take hydrochlorothiazide too?
PATIENT: No they told me to stop taking that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That was a couple of weeks ago.
DOCTOR: And you're checking your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And it's running pretty good?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] kidney doctor. So they're probably just gonna watch you.  The ultrasound looks okay.  Um we're gonna check, so we can check AFP, UA, PTT, [REDACTED].  Are you taking the high dose vitamin B, the ergocalciferol?
PATIENT: Right.  But I just started that.
DOCTOR: You just started that?
PATIENT: Yeah I think I've taken the second one.  Well I've taken it on Wednesday and this will be like the third one tomorrow, it's the third time I took. I just got it.
DOCTOR:
DOCTOR: you on that?
PATIENT: Uh no it was, whoever I was seeing at the Gold Clinic.
DOCTOR: Oh you were in the Gold Clinic?
PATIENT: This was last week when I was there.
DOCTOR: Huh.
PATIENT: Over in the Gold Clinic.  That's why I hadn't been over here in a while.
DOCTOR: Oh okay the last appointment was [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Now last week they was telling me something about magnesium.
DOCTOR: Yeah your magnesium is low.  Are you taking your potassium?
PATIENT: I haven't had it, I haven't got anything.
DOCTOR: Okay well we'll refill it okay.  Um they did order it for you.
PATIENT: Hmm I haven't received it yet.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: Now certain food, does all food have magnesium or certain foods have magnesium?
DOCTOR: Well, I know what foods have potassium; I don't know what food has magnesium.
PATIENT: Magnesium.  Cause the way it was explained to me it was something like uh I'm not getting enough magnesium through my food or something and so I need to know what foods have magnesium.
DOCTOR: Um you're chronically low, just take supplements.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um so that's done and then okay so today we need labs okay.
PATIENT: Again, I was here labs last week.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED], so we don't need some of the labs, this you got so that's good.  Um but you do need [REDACTED].  You need refills of all your meds?
PATIENT: I need refills on the glipizide.
DOCTOR: Okay and metformin?
PATIENT: Metformin I think I'm pretty good on.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Oh any test strips?
PATIENT: Uh yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Rosuvastatin?
PATIENT: I think I just got that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Recently yeah.
DOCTOR: Allopurinol?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: So you need that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I would try to stay away from colchicine.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: If you get gout maybe they can give you some prednisone for kidney function.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But um I'll leave that to DOCTOR okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  So you're saying that the uh colchicine that's uh.
DOCTOR: It can hurt the kidneys.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um that’s why you’re not on chronic colchicine therapy.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But um if you get an attack um well, you have diabetes [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's a steroid isn't it?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Yeah [REDACTED].  Let me talk to DOCTOR about it okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um lisinopril right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Do you want them mailed?
PATIENT: Yeah by mail.
DOCTOR: Not at the window?
PATIENT: No. It takes too long.
DOCTOR: Oh does it?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: When you come back tomorrow I'll still be there waiting to get it.
DOCTOR: Oh, now. (Laughs.) Oh okay.
PATIENT: And the, does it say anything about the magnesium?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay [REDACTED] the gout.  I think what you need to do is check your sugars in the middle of the day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um and see, do you think your sugars on the whole have been improving or just have been staying the same?
PATIENT: I'd say half and half.  I think they're improving but I mean I haven't, the highest I ever seen was like 180.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So [REDACTED] glipizide um you know you should check your sugars in the middle of the day and come back for an appointment cause.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: I think [REDACTED] your diabetes has not been controlled but it improved slightly since June but every three months that's for the control for every three months.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So you probably do have to go up on the glipizide.  When did you start the glipizide?
PATIENT: Oh it's been a while, at least a couple years I think.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Why didn't they increase the [REDACTED]?  Maybe they wanted to see if it got any better.  Um how would you feel about injecting yourself with insulin?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You won't?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Not under any circumstances?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  Um and is there a reason why?
PATIENT: Well one I don't want to and the other part is I drive truck if I'm shooting insulin I can't drive.  I'm a truck driver.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  What if we increase the glipizide as much as we can and really there’s no – once someone is on two drugs for oral?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: For diabetes and if they are still not controlled, then we suggest insulin. I can always increase this and see how you do.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um but the control of the diabetes is really, really important.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So you know [REDACTED] your legs and heart attacks and strokes, and all those complications.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's why we really want your diabetes controlled.  [REDACTED] and I'll talk to DOCTOR and see okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um any changes in your vision?  Changes in the sensation in your leg?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Chest pain, shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  Increased fluid, retention?
PATIENT: Just fat.  I’m just kidding.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Okay.  Can you lean forward for me please sir?  Deep breath out again out.  Okay, do you smoke?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Have you ever?
PATIENT: Never.
DOCTOR: Very good.  Let me see if you have any swelling.  No swelling at all.  Open your mouth for me.  Alright [REDACTED].  Good.  I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  26:59  DOCTOR IN:  47:17)
DOCTOR: Okay.  So here's the thing.  The best thing to do for these attacks while you’re still on allopurinol.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um we're gonna restart you back on the colchicine cause colchicine can really prevent attacks.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But that's usually good up to like six months and I'm also gonna send you to Renal and Rheumatology.  Um and Rheumatology because of this recurrent gout to see if there's any other medications they can put you on.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And to see you have to continue the colchicine um so just 0.6 mg per day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  If you so wish to hold off on the colchicine until you see Rheumatology that's up to you.
PATIENT: How long will it take to see Rheumatology?
DOCTOR: Huh?
PATIENT: How long will it take for that appointment?
DOCTOR: Um to be really honest I don't know.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I don't think it'll be, like, incredibly long I think I mean its Rheumatology, I think they should be able to see you hopefully soon.  Um what I'll do is on this follow-up sheet, I'll put the consult in and I'll say [REDACTED] in a month.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you can see them and see how that goes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then I also want you to see the kidney doctors.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: To make sure everything is stable and to investigate why you're having, what is causing this insufficiency of your kidneys.  Oh shoot.
(DOCTOR OUT:  48:52  DOCTOR IN:  49:17)
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um so there's various things that can cause kidney inefficiency, one is uncontrolled diabetes.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: One is high blood pressure gets out of control and your blood pressure looks controlled.  One is recurrent gout.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um but I want you to see the kidney doctors so they can watch you and prevent any further progression.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay um and what I'm gonna do for your diabetes is increase the glipizide.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: From 1 1/2 to 2 tablets.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So it’s 20 mgs um after that, I'll double check but after that um if when DOCTOR rechecks the hemoglobin A1c we may have to consider insulin but we'll see what happens okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I know it's tough but maybe you can stop on the side in the truck and its.  We just want to prevent any further complications from happening.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And [REDACTED].  Oh my goodness alright, okay.  Okay so I'll look and see, okay let's do that.  Oh so I’m going to increase 20 units, let’s do that. You only use the one and a 1/2 tablets once daily.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Right?
PATIENT: Well it ends up being yeah, but I'll take.
DOCTOR: All day long.
PATIENT: All day long.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: One and a half all day long.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We'll do that, check your sugars, check your labs, I'll do that, we'll repeat a urine sample to check [REDACTED] and we'll check okay and we're gonna do a consult [REDACTED].  Do you have like like hardening on your toe or anything or any like crystals in your toe?  I [REDACTED] figure it out now.  And then we'll refer you to the Renal Clinic, Rheumatology, I'll renew the colchicine.  Do you want your um medicines mailed?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] good.  Okay mail it uh-huh.  Then [REDACTED].  Okay so Nephrology will contact you about the appointment.
PATIENT: Hmm.  So if I want to make an appointment for the Ortho and podiatrist how do I do that?  Through you or do I call?
DOCTOR: So I'll put a, I think you can call but I'll make sure to put a consult in.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So they see that online okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll get labs done today [REDACTED].  You're not having ulcers [REDACTED] with your feet right?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Just give this to the front clerk.
PATIENT: Is the orthopedics on there too for my knee?
DOCTOR: What's going on with your knee?
PATIENT: I'm having problems with my right knee.  I've been saying something about for quite a while.  Right now it's like I have to, in order to sleep I have to sleep with a pillow between my knees.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It's bothering you with the pain?
PATIENT: Yeah the right knee.
DOCTOR: Do you want physical therapy?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Because the orthopedist will see you if there's some surgery or something that needs to be done but the right knee on the x-ray is just [REDACTED] nothing really there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So it could be just mild like, you know it could just be joint pain.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um you use your right knee to accelerate?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah um that could be a cause of it too.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Um I would stay away from ibuprofen or something.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: If you want Tylenol, take Tylenol for pain.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Do you want some prescribed for you?
PATIENT: No I can get that over-the-counter.
DOCTOR: So you can take Tylenol for pain.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And see if that helps.  Um yeah.  See if that helps um I'm going to put a recall in like for a few months.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
