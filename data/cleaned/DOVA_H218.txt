DOCTOR: Well that's excellent.  You are one of the first person today who say he's superb.  You win the superb award.  Alright, so we haven't seen you in this clinic for a while.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Cause you have been in and out of the hospital.
PATIENT: Continuously.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] more times than I can tell.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Alright so since the last time you saw us, about a year ago, a few things have happened right.  You've had surgery up here.  You got surgery on your foot.  You had that cardiac catheterization done.
PATIENT: That's right.
DOCTOR: You were seen at Hines, you're like uh we'll just manage you with your medicines right, is that what they decided?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay and then recently you were just hospitalized because you were having nausea and vomiting.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And also I had uh amputation.
DOCTOR: Yep, yep.  That's a lot, that's enough for you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You don't get any more for the rest of the year.
PATIENT: (Laughter)
DOCTOR: Um how are you, how's the nausea and the vomiting?
PATIENT: Um right now it's relatively cool.  I haven't had much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um those pills they sent you home with, that Reglan and metoclopramide, it's that one you take before you eat, is that helping?
PATIENT: I don't know tell me.  I mean I take the medicine so maybe it is.
DOCTOR: So it is cause it's not coming back right.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: We just keep going with it okay.  We don't want to mess up a good thing alright, okay.  And then that other stomach acid medicine, the ranitidine, has that been helping you?
PATIENT: That's the one for the gut?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H218
No the gut is the one you take before the meal.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The other one is uh.
SECOND PERSON H218
It's that half a pill that you take.
DOCTOR: Twice a day?
SECOND PERSON H218
Twice a day for the stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
SECOND PERSON H218
So he's been taking that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So tell me what you're taking for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Uh 10 cc.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Every evening.
DOCTOR: Okay and do you check your sugars?
PATIENT: Every now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So um I would like for you to check your sugars more regularly.  Anytime anybody's on insulin we got to just check them a little bit more frequently.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um when you do check them what do you think they run?
PATIENT: You was gonna say something.  Oh well anywhere from uh 140, 150, up to maybe 160, or 70.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any lows, have you felt low?
PATIENT: Uh when I first got out of the hospital I was getting some 80s and 70s.
DOCTOR: Okay and you felt it then huh.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, the 140s to 150s, low 70s, alrighty.  Okay now the last number we had on you, do you know what an A1c is?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay so instead of, so what an A1c is this new measure that we have for the last couple of years uh to check on patients with diabetes.  It's a test that we check in your blood and they checked it in your blood when you were in the hospital and it gives you kind of like an average reading over the three months.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: When you just prick your finger it's just really.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: What you just age, what time of day it is, what medicines you're on but this one gives us an average for over three months okay and for every diabetic their goal is less than 7 okay.  For you, yours was 7.3.  So close but not close yeah.
PATIENT: Still a little bit high.
DOCTOR: Yeah so um I think since they put you on that regimen of insulin we have to just wait a couple of months right, to see if it's really taking effect.  Which is fine you know.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Which is okay so we'll just have you check in a couple of months and see how that's going.  Now um issue number two is you had a history of high blood pressure right.  Yes.
PATIENT: Well I didn't have a history but I did develop a history.
DOCTOR: Okay [REDACTED]. Um and right now we have you on metoprolol 75 mg a day right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um the lisinopril 10 mg a day okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you're taking all those?  You don't miss a dose?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay good, you're close enough to where I wouldn't change anything about it.  You're 134, 133 so that's good enough for me.  Um do you check your blood pressure at home?  Do you have a blood pressure cuff?
PATIENT: I have one.  I haven't been using it cause I'm in the hospital.
DOCTOR: You didn't do it yourself cause we're checking it for you.
PATIENT: And plus every, there's a woman who comes in and she does it.
DOCTOR: Oh good.  What has it been running when she does it?
PATIENT: Uh 160, 120s, 130s.
DOCTOR: So that kind ranges in the low one okay, okay.  We're okay now so I don't want to do too much so that's okay and then last week we started you on a medicine for your cholesterol right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: The simvastatin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay good so let's keep going with that.  You're not having any muscle pain.
SECOND PERSON H218
I think he needs some more of the cholesterol.
DOCTOR: Okay, sure. We’ll refill it all.
SECOND PERSON H218
Okay.
DOCTOR: And then are you taking a baby aspirin?
PATIENT: Yes.
SECOND PERSON H218
Yeah.
DOCTOR: A baby aspirin.  Okay, um so a couple people we got to get you hooked up with okay.  Um one is our cardiologist okay.

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Say I need to.
DOCTOR: If you need to see the Vascular Clinic yes.

PATIENT: Oh I've had a lot of those done in the past.
DOCTOR: In the past and when was the last one do you think?
PATIENT: Oh it's been quite a while.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I haven't ever had it done here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I think we said in our last note that you had it done about eight years ago.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: About a year ago so about nine years ago and then we tried to bring up some records from Mercy.
PATIENT: Yeah now Mercy, I went by there.  Mercy said after ten years they get rid of all their records.
DOCTOR: Okay, well is a colonoscopy something you want, well we recommend it for anybody between the age of 50 and 75 we recommend you get a colonoscopy and if it's been that long.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It would probably be about time again, is that okay?
PATIENT: I can do it yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alrighty.  Okay well, anything that's bothering you today?
PATIENT: Um yeah I've I have been - applied for my veterans benefits.

PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay take care, alright.
PATIENT: Thank you for stopping in.
DOCTOR: Okay sure.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So a couple of changes we're gonna make.  So for the diabetes, uh we think that you're actually overall doing pretty good.  I think we could just fine tune it just a little bit.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So instead of taking the 10 units, if you want to bump it up just a little bit to the 12 okay.
PATIENT: 12 okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll see how it is.  You can check your sugars.  I want you to start checking your sugars more regularly at home okay.  So if you want to check it up, you know, mostly like five times out of the week you check it before.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: In the mornings or something you know before you eat anything and then a couple of times a week check it uh about an hour or so or two hours after you eat okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that we can see both what those are and in three months when you come back to see me, I want you to tell me how your sugars have been doing, okay.
PATIENT: Has done, okay.
DOCTOR: Now if you find that you're going to low, cut back you know, try 11 units.  If that's not helping then go back to 10 okay.
PATIENT: Right and it's such a small difference.
DOCTOR: I know.  I know.  But its, but for you it might be a bigger difference.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because you're not that heavy you know.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So that makes a little bit more of a fine tuning okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And we'll get you back in to see our eye doctor.  Let's see when the last time we had you see them last um.
PATIENT: I know it's been at least four months, five months.
SECOND PERSON H218
Almost a year.
PATIENT: No that's too long isn't it?
SECOND PERSON H218
No it's been almost a year.  It was in the summertime when you had it done.
PATIENT: Where at?
SECOND PERSON H218

DOCTOR: Well I'm glad you think that was fun.  I don't know about that.  But yeah we'll get you back in to see them.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll get you back to see the Eye Clinic so let's do that.  We're going to increase that to 12 okay and that's it for the diabetes okay.  So next is for your heart and your blood pressure.  So with your heart condition that we were talking about your blood pressure could be just a little bit lower and it would be better okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Not too crazy but just a little lower so we wanted to you know that lisinopril that you're on, so you're taking like half a tablet right?
SECOND PERSON H218
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We want you to go ahead and take a full tablet of it okay.  so, it'll be one tablet.
PATIENT: That's one tablet, one full on that one.
DOCTOR: Yes a full one.
PATIENT: And for the other one I'm already taking 1 1/2.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  That one you leave just as it.
