DOCTOR: So you haven't really been out of the house?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: OK. OK. Uhm I think that's all my questions for now. Uh I definitely like to get you a covid test just because your symptoms are consistent with some common covid symptoms. So basically that means that we would do a swab. It might not come back for a day or two. You definitely have to self isolate between now and when you get the results back, potentially even if it's negative, longer, if you're still having symptoms.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Otherwise, there probably. There might be a couple other tests we want to do. We might have more questions when we come back, we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today, but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next. Did you have anything else you wanted to tell me that I didn't ask you about or any questions?
PATIENT: No, uh thank you so much.
DOCTOR: OK, well thanks for coming in today. Will definitely get you taken care of shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: K thanks.
