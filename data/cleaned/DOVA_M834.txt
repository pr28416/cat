PATIENT: No, no, no.  I should've brought the book with me, I keep a record of it but.
DOCTOR: Okay yeah it's a little elevated here.  You're on a very small dose of the water pill so it might not be doing that much.
PATIENT: Oh there's one other thing the ear, I don't know if you know uh skin will peel when you get sunburned.
DOCTOR: Yeah, does your ears [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: In this one only, I can scrape a lot of the dead skin out.  I don't know what's eating in there.
DOCTOR: It's dry, probably due to the weather, it's really dry.
PATIENT: No but then why ain't the other one?
DOCTOR: Sometimes one will be more affected, I'll look at it.
PATIENT: But it's all year long it seems like, both summer, winter, spring, fall.
DOCTOR: Really, okay.  Well I mean if it's a skin problem we could always you know have Derm see you and see if they recommend any topical treatments.
PATIENT: Uh they gave me some kind of a cream for the darn finger.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And the detail sheet says don't put it on the fingernail so I don't know where I was supposed to be putting it.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: I broke the finger, ran into a door, a guy opened his car door and I biked right into it.
DOCTOR: Has this peeling of your ear, is it affecting your hearing or no?

DOCTOR: Okay.  Other than that, any chest pain, any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any [REDACTED] issues?
PATIENT: But I do get the pain in the right ear from time to time because I think there's a fluid build-up in there and I was reluctant to have them drain it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Maybe I should get it pinched and drained.
DOCTOR: And so it's just the hydrochlorothiazide they started back in October so you've been on it for a few months now is that right?

PATIENT: Hope nature will fight it off, whatever.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Alright it shows that your heart is pumping properly um.  You have mild to moderate aortic regurg so [REDACTED] watching that, you’re asymptomatic, so that's good.
PATIENT: I might have been born that way, although there might be some stenosis I guess they said.
DOCTOR: Um no stenosis of the aortic valve, they said there might be sclerosis but that's not worrisome; it's just that the regurg that's worrisome that's what we want to follow.
