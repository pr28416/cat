PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Uh most of the times the readings at the hospitals are not the correct ones.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because you walk all the way down and then you know you are already on the stressful situation.

DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  Do you think the uh [REDACTED] medications to help you out in controlling your mood?

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, you know um.  My lack of uh, my ability to maintain a job or find a job you know, so um I could be depressed sometimes more than others.
DOCTOR: When you said that you had, you might have a MRI, you said you never [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I went down to.
DOCTOR: The other hospital.
PATIENT: It was at a yeah, at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh let's see, [REDACTED] okay.  Um what I'm gonna do is we're [REDACTED] discuss with my clinic supervisor.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we discussed about the [REDACTED] and come up with a plan.
PATIENT: Yeah there's another thing, I have a doctor, I have a civilian doctor as well.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They diagnosed me with asthma.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That just happened, I want to say probably a month ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They gave me a [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Albuterol?
PATIENT: It was the pink, the pink one.
DOCTOR: The pink one.
PATIENT: Yeah and I take it twice a day to control my asthma.
DOCTOR: Do you take even today, you take it on a daily basis?
PATIENT: Yeah twice a day.
DOCTOR: What happens exactly?
PATIENT: Oh what happened is I was wheezing and I couldn't breathe.
DOCTOR: When was that?  A month back?
PATIENT: About a month.  I came to the Emergency Room here when it was bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I was coughing um severely.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I came to this Emergency Room and the lady gave me a regular bottle, not the one that they have but a red bottle instead.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And um I take that and all it did was calm me down but they didn't do anything, anything tremendous for me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then I went to my civilian doctor to find out why was I coughing so much.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I went to St. um, St. Agnes is it or St. Alexis.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I went to St. Alexis and I did a pulmonary exam.  During my pulmonary exam I blanked out.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Um so during that blank out the technician and the doctor said that they cannot continue the exam because I blanked out on the pulmonary exam.  I came over here to DOCTOR, down at Garfield.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: At the VA Hospital and saw a doctor in there, and whatever his name, and he gave me, he was the pulmonary doctor he gave me an exam and he said he just checked it that I do have asthma.  DOCTOR was the doctor's name.
DOCTOR: So you came over here at the Emergency.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That was June, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that's right.  [REDACTED] yep.
DOCTOR: Uh I don't see that in June [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Was it June?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] inhalers?  Did they?
PATIENT: Yeah they gave me; um well they gave me something outta here.
DOCTOR: They gave you a nasal spray.  They gave you a spray to put in your nose?
PATIENT: Oh that's what they gave me?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Was that from the Emergency Room or was that from the doctor because I wasn't breathing good with my sleep um, with my CPAP machine?
DOCTOR: So [REDACTED].  I don't see the reason why they gave you but that is what is here.  I don't see any uh.
PATIENT: Okay.  I mean you might be right, it's been a while but I came to the Emergency Room cause um a constant cold that wouldn't go away.
DOCTOR: I get that and they gave you some antibiotics for it.
PATIENT: There you go; they gave me some of that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So they, so I wasn't satisfied with the Emergency Room results here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I was supposed to go to DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they did some more testing which I think the VA should have done it themselves.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they failed to do.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then the doctor I went to see was DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Down at [REDACTED] hospital.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And he diagnosed me with um asthma.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.  Uh, typically with asthma what we see is when we listen to your chest we see something called wheezing okay.
PATIENT: Yes that's what I was doing, that's right and that's what I was doing too.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh, did you have asthma in the past?
PATIENT: Never.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me tell you this story, okay, this is how it goes.  Uh, usually at your age [REDACTED].  Most of the time the asthma is a [REDACTED] of what happened during your childhood okay.  It is very rare for a person to have a new onset asthma at your age.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Not impossible, it can happen but it is not usual.  In asthma what we hear is wheezing okay.  Many of the time, you have got an infection.  That also tends to relate to wheezing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And infection gets corrected and the moment the infection gets corrected the wheezing gets corrected.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So the thought they treating you, they give you some dramatic relief with this wheezing okay.  So all wheezing need not be asthma.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: But then you need to be [REDACTED] and it was correct to start you on those medications.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Today I am not able to hear any wheezing on your chest.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But on the days when you do do, you taking puffs on a regular basis.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Because if you do it on a regular basis then you might not be [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So [REDACTED] I'm not going to make a diagnosis of whether you have asthma or not.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh, what I will do is that we will uh, I will talk, I will discuss with my supervisor.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: What would the plan be if we stopped the inhaler and can see how you do by stopping it and the moment you have the problems, you take the inhaler.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: They work there and then.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we can [REDACTED] but how many times do you need to use that inhaler in a month okay?  If you need to take it more than once in a month, then you might need to consider reevaluating you for asthma.
PATIENT: But they never evaluated[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So we can go ahead and do that okay?
PATIENT: Fine.  That's what I'm saying.  I think, I feel.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That the VA should of did further evaluation for that emergency result.
DOCTOR: Exactly.  With the kind of story you presented at the Emergency Room, Iâ€™m reading through your note, if I had been there, I would not have evaluated you for asthma. The reason being, first of all, asthma onset as an adult is very unusual   What we will do is [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Sure, sure.
DOCTOR: And if you have an infection and I think that we will, then we cannot evaluate for asthma.
PATIENT: Right cause you're treating an infection.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: Yeah, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But after the infection.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: I should get a follow-up.
DOCTOR: Yes.  After the infection you gonna get a follow-up provided okay and that is what I am doing now okay.  So let us do that way, if nobody diagnosed you with asthma, I would never do a function test on you, a pulmonary function test.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But now since somebody diagnosed you, let's make sure that what we are dealing with is actually correct or not.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So you stop using the inhaler for now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Keep the inhaler only when you need it okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And then we count the times of how many times you need it, if you need it for more than one a month then we'll get you back over here and weâ€™ll evaluate you for asthma okay?  And then we'll do a pulmonary function test to get to see what kind of lung problems okay.  It may not be asthma, maybe something else [REDACTED] do that, okay?
PATIENT: But based on, based on DOCTOR evaluation, another civilian doctor.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
PATIENT: Um and he determined that DOCTOR diagnosed me with asthma.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
PATIENT: Based on the other doctor's assessment, can you say then do a function test?  Can you talk to your supervisor.  Cause I myself would like to get a function test, so what I want to know, I don't want to wait another month or two months.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That look at as BS.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or why, look I gotta do something, I gotta go back and not hear [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I feel I got a problem and I want to rectify it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What happens you believe the person [REDACTED] asthma.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Asthma is a disease that you already carry it, okay.  Even if you have an asthma okay, but asthma may have some problem only once a month okay.  So what happens is you'll be normal, asthma attack comes, you get into the situation that day and come back to normal, you remain normal and [REDACTED] and then you get asthma.  That's how the attack of asthma comes okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now when you are normal.
PATIENT: Mine didn't come like that.
DOCTOR: How does it come.
PATIENT: If I'm, if I'm exerting myself.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The asthma hits me.  If I'm doing exercise.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or I'm walking up the stairs, my asthma hits me.
DOCTOR: It hits you.
PATIENT: If I'm having sex with my wife, the asthma hits me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I'm tired of that.  I really am.
DOCTOR: Now.  This is another kind of asthma.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: This is the kind of asthma which call exercise-induced asthma okay.  Now if you have got these kinds of symptoms, then the best way to treat it is when you anticipate that you do the, [REDACTED] when you are gonna get the asthma, is to take a puff before that okay.  That is typically what you do.  That's typically what you do right?
PATIENT: Iâ€™m laughing here because Iâ€™m in the middle of a sex problem here, with my wife.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And here I'm getting an attack.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Which it's, it's funny because I have to stop having my sex, intimate moment with my wife, it's just a problem.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it frustrates me that I can't continue this process.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: And you're telling me this way.  I'm saying I want the test, I want the test now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I want to get it over with.  I'm frustrated.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  If you are on a normal day okay, if you're on a normal day when you get the test.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It's gonna come normal okay.  This test is gonna be normal okay.  What we Iâ€™m trying.
PATIENT: How can you call me a date for a test when you don't know if day I'm going to have an attack or not?
DOCTOR: What we do is something called challenge test.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Where we give you some medication which is gonna precipitate your asthma at that time at the Lab okay and then they'll do the test.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But we'll see whether you are, whether there, it is a precipitating factor okay.  Now I just wonder since now I'm seeing you for the first time okay, let me try and to get that indication [REDACTED] that you actually need it okay.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: A simple pulmonary function test is something which can be done anytime okay.  Challenge test is something which I can do it but that is what I'm just trying to and I'm going to analyze it but let me see how you do [REDACTED] okay.  Now then if you need it we can schedule you on the phone and you can come out and have it okay.
PATIENT: Uh yeah that's cool.
DOCTOR: What I'm trying to do, the situation at this time is, you could stop the inhaler for now okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you do some kind of exercise and if you get short of breath at that time the next time what you do is even before you started the exercise, take that puff.  Even if you don't have symptoms.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Now do the exercise.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And we'll see if you get that symptoms again or not okay, okay.  If you don't get that symptoms then it gives me an idea that you are having so-called exercise-induced asthma and the only way how we control the exercise-induced asthma is by giving you medication prior to that exercise so it's not that you develop the symptoms and then you get the medication no.  If you feel that when you lift your boxes, you get asthma.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Then you, even before lifting the boxes you get a puff, do the exercise and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm not using the word exercise, anytime I walk up flights of stairs[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Exactly.
(Knock on the door)
PATIENT: Okay.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well that is what I'm trying to prove to you at this time okay and I will try to, I will try to reschedule the appointment in three months, earlier if you require.  Then all you need to do is give me a call okay.
PATIENT: So give me the card.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly and then at that time I can actually get some idea that how many times you needed it okay and how many times it actually benefited you.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, um this will give me some idea that which kind of test [REDACTED] I need to put in and what type of [REDACTED] test I need to verify.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: This gives me an idea of what.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If I did one now, I'm sure it would come normal.
PATIENT: Okay.  No that's good yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  I'm going to discuss this with DOCTOR okay and then I'll be back in a few minutes and then we'll talk more about it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Sounds good to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
(DOCTOR OUT:  88:38)
DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR.
PATIENT: How ya doing sir?
DOCTOR: Great and yourself?
PATIENT: Not bad.
DOCTOR: My name is DOCTOR I work with DOCTOR here.  Uh we were just kind of talking a little bit about what's going on.  [REDACTED] I'll have you sit there for a minute, [REDACTED] formal about it.  Now um, are you a smoker?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never.
DOCTOR: Never.  Not even pot?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay alright um, it's just kind of weird to have asthma pop up later in life.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So um, DOCTOR we were talking quite a bit about what to do about this and we got a plan for it but I think ultimately you wanted to try and redo that test that sounds like they couldn't do last time.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Did they use, was it one where they asked you to breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe?
PATIENT: Exactly.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I blanked out on that exam.
DOCTOR: Okay alright.
PATIENT: It happened at St um, St. Alexis.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Would you mind trying it again?
PATIENT: No I don't mind.  I want to find out what's going.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: I really do.
DOCTOR: Cause you know there's other things that kind of creep into the picture you know with your obstructive sleep apnea.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: That could be affecting things.  You know, so you look like you sometimes have [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah around my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, what do you, what kind of stuff.
PATIENT: Uh I go to school right now, to auto mechanic school.
DOCTOR: Okay do you notice that your shortness of breath is problematic at work?
PATIENT: No it's only when I do any kind activity.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  So I think starting from scratch is reasonable.  We may not find the answer with just one test but at least we can call the decision if it's not asthma.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: It's a pretty good test.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If we can get you through it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and then in the meantime we're gonna have you stop that albuterol.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You don't need to take it twice a day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um you can take it if you feel like you need it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you feel like this is associated with exertion as well um you can take it um basically like half an hour to an hour before.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You start exerting yourself so in some ways it's like pulmonary Viagra.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay.
DOCTOR: To dilate.  I think this happens a lot when you're with your wife.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so, if you think you're gonna put the moves on her you know.
