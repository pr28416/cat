PATIENT: Yeah, they're all healthy.
DOCTOR: OK. Any old carpet, dust, mold, or asbestos in your home?
PATIENT: Um not that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: No, OK. OK, well it seems like um those are all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?
PATIENT: Uh no, I just want to get tested for Covid.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so we will definitely do a Covid swab on you because you have a cough, um and those results should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours, and so you'll know more then. But because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we still recommend isolating for 14 days. But the other thing I want to mention is that you don't have any other symptoms of infection besides your cough, and it seems like the cough started a week ago and you started this new medication ramipril two weeks ago, and so ramipril is a type of ACE inhibitor and one of its side effects is that in some people it can cause coughing. So, I am going to review your medications and if your family Doc also agrees, we may try uh another um blood pressure medication for you instead of ramipril.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Um so we'll try and change that medication and see if your coughing stops. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds great.
DOCTOR: OK, great, thank you.
