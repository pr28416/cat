I've had some sinus infections and I just feel like I have one right now and I know that like I know that you know, a lot of the time I I've done all the things that I've been told to do in the past like I've been doing, like Saline rinses and just doesn't feel like it's helping very much right now. When I rinse, I'm getting like this greenie gross kind of mucus coming out. And it's just like giving me this like headache. It just feels crappy.

DOCTOR: OK. OK, uhm, and are you on any medications?
PATIENT: No, like I I sometimes like I used this saline rinse.
DOCTOR: OK.
PATIENT: For a bit. I used to use the nasal steroid spray and I I hadn't had an infection for awhile and things were feeling OK, so I haven't been using it recently. Umm, and then I occasionally will use like, like an Advil if my knees sore.
DOCTOR: OK. OK, and no hospitalizations or surgeries?

DOCTOR: OK, I see. And any old carpets, smoke, asbestos, mold anything like that at home?
PATIENT: No, no, it's a pretty new house.
DOCTOR: OK, alright, any pets at home?
PATIENT: We have a dog. It's a labradoodle.
DOCTOR: OK, yeah.
PATIENT: And that's it, yeah.
DOCTOR: How long have you had him?
PATIENT: Oh, like, he's like 3 now. Like my sinus infections and that have been going on for longer than we've had him.
DOCTOR: OK, alright. Those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for me?
PATIENT: I don't think so. I just I hope you know, we can do something about this. Because you know, I tried all this stuff that is supposed to be like, you know, conservative like the first steps and it just doesn't seem like it's getting better. It's been like few weeks. So, I thought it was probably time to come see you.
DOCTOR: Yeah, sorry. What have you tried at home again?
PATIENT: So I use the, the rinses the saline rinses. I used a little bit of nasal decongestant but I know like I know I've been told I'm not supposed to do that for more than a few days, so I don't. Yeah, that's, I think that's pretty well it 'cause they said there's not much we can really do.
DOCTOR: OK, yeah. So your symptoms, OK because some some of these things overlap with Covid, we're going to have to swab you and they'll notify you of your results in like 24 to 48 hours. But what it sounds like is something called Sinu, Sinusitis and it sounds like acute bacterial rhinosinusitis because of some f the symptoms that you have, and it's been going on for more than a week and it's, it's not going away with the rinse, saline rinses and these decongestants. So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up. If they continue to be severe, umm, actually, at this will also prescribe you some inhaled corticosteroids because I think those can help as well, so will give you both of those for now and then just follow up with us in a week after you've tried both things and we'll see how your symptoms are holding up at that point. Does that sound like a good plan to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think that sounds that sounds fair. Yeah, thank you.
DOCTOR: OK, yeah no problem.
