DOCTOR: PATIENT.  Hi.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  How you doing?
DOCTOR: I heard you were in the hospital.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How you doing?
PATIENT: Well the first thing I need to do is [REDACTED] last time.
DOCTOR: Is that when you went to the hospital?
PATIENT: No I was in the hospital because I had chronic hepatitis and my [REDACTED] was up.
DOCTOR: How you doing now?
PATIENT: Well I feel I'm just doing a little better.  Every now and then I have feels like I got to throw up but it eased.
DOCTOR: I'm trying to find the last notes.  How long were in the hospital for this time?
PATIENT: About a week.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: One day short of a week.
DOCTOR: So you haven't been hospitalized in a while before this time.
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] what’s been going on, your ankle been bothering you?
PATIENT: My ankle, yeah, [REDACTED] When they took [REDACTED] it's kind of lightheaded [REDACTED] and I had a lot of pain.  They tried to do that blockage for the nerves for it but it, it helped a little bit.  [REDACTED] but it still hurts.
DOCTOR: Have you been to the Pain Clinic yet?
PATIENT: Yesterday.
DOCTOR: So it help out a little bit?
PATIENT: Yeah a little bit but you know now when I go, you know when I be going down steps or you sometimes when I lay down and try to get up I'd be in pain or sometimes when I sit down.  But if I'm moving around for a while you know it stops and you know it's kind of like whenever I'm up but whenever I lay down or sit down and have to get up then it gives me all kind of problems.  At nighttime I'll have to you know and when I get up and use the bathroom I have to constant deal with my pain.  I have to stand up before I bend down.
DOCTOR: So just remind me, so they just took out the hardware right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So they took out some of the hardware.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And they took out the hardware, when was it?
PATIENT: In February.
DOCTOR: February.  And then since February you've been having a lot of pain in your ankle?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Cause they said there's a separation in the bone where it broke.  It didn't heal properly because they took the metal out and they don't want to do another surgery.  So they're trying to get the pain management.  Pain Management said it might work and it might not work and you have to go through a series of close to five shots before it would really make a, you know, big difference.
DOCTOR: So I think probably the best thing is to kind of let's see how it goes, because it’s your first time right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] in your ankle?
PATIENT: No what they gave me for my back.
DOCTOR: For your back.  Are you still taking the pain meds at home?
PATIENT: Uh yeah.
DOCTOR: What are you taking right now?
PATIENT: Morphine which don't really work that much.  Because I been on it for so long that I've built up a tolerance for it.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: But I still have the pain and I took [REDACTED].  You know they tried raising it, they give prescriptions now but sometime when I take them it don't even seem like it do no good cause it still has an ache and I have a stabbing pain and sometimes it feels like it's burning.  They gave me some [REDACTED] but [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah so.
DOCTOR: And you've got diabetes right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Have you been checking your sugars at home?
PATIENT: Yeah my sugars been running a bit high.
DOCTOR: Which numbers?
PATIENT: Uh like 275, 188, it's always over the 150.  I forgot to bring my meter cause the meter holds the readings.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I forgot to bring it with me.
DOCTOR: So I have you taking 100 units of Glargine [REDACTED]lantis?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No 14 units.
PATIENT: 14.
DOCTOR: Okay and you're also taking the regular, the Novolin?
PATIENT: Regular at night, well I take regular three times a day almost you know, whenever it's over the 150 and uh I take the other one and that's what I take every nighttime.
DOCTOR: We're gonna have to go up because your sugars, I'm looking back, have been too high.  How's your diet been?
PATIENT: Well my diet's been pretty where I like, you know every now and then you know I have maybe I don't have a desire to eat but most of the time I take my medicine in the morning [REDACTED] I try to you know eat something so you know I have something to work with it.  Yeah.
DOCTOR: Are you taking the regular insulin three times a day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: With the sliding scale.
PATIENT: Yes and anytime it goes over 150.  But you know I [REDACTED] gain any weight because now I'm 218 instead of [REDACTED] and I was down, at first I was in the 180s.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And now I'm in the 200s because you know what insulin do for me is I take it on a regular basis, it uh raises the appetite so at nighttime they give us snacks cause I'm in a transition house.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And sometime I find myself eating cookies and candy and stuff all through the night, potato chips and stuff.
DOCTOR: Well that's going to definitely screw up your diabetes, what you got to do is, and this is serious, I mean now [REDACTED] we can’t keep going up on your insulin forever but try to eat um, if there's candy eat an apple or fruits, okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Different things. All those treats, uh, [REDACTED].  So you're not drinking anything are you?
PATIENT: No.  I haven't drunk since [REDACTED].  I had one drink last August.
DOCTOR: And you're taking the gabapentin?
PATIENT: Yeah I be taking that every day three times a day but sometimes uh when I take all that medication you know I got a lot of things I have to do through the day and stuff so it makes me tired and sluggish but you know I go to custodian class Monday, Thursday and Friday and every day I go to ATP [REDACTED] you know but I been having problems [REDACTED] ATP.  I went through a lot of [REDACTED] this week.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's uh for drug and alcohol.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's where they [REDACTED] training the class.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: For recovery and.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you been having any chest pain or anything like that?
PATIENT: No.  But I been having a lot of frequent urination at nighttime.  Sometime I'm going to get up five, six times a night.  It's just like every time I lay down really again, you know like I say my leg, it's real bad when I have to get up and go to the bathroom cause it's real painful.
DOCTOR: Have you been thirsty a lot during the day?
PATIENT: No I cut back.  I really don't drink that much pop anymore.  I don't drink unless it’s dinnertime and usually for a while you know pretty much I was real bloated.  You know my stomach went out to here, it was real puffy, you know up to.
DOCTOR: Did you ever try the, I think the urinating a lot is probably from your sugars being so high okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we got to try to get these under control and I think we're probably going to help you out with you peeing so much, cause that's a lot.  So that’s a lot of peeing in a day.
PATIENT: Hmm.  And it's at all times at night.  You know during the day, you see I have more urination in the nighttime than I do in the day.  You know [REDACTED] four, five, six times a night you know.  When I'm in the Transition House and there's six men to the room.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: They say man, you know they be whining, I say well it's probably all these medications, I know it could be my sugars too.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's probably your sugars more than anything else.
PATIENT: And then at night, [REDACTED] long time that I don't have to go, you know [REDACTED].  Last night was the first time.
DOCTOR: So um you just turned 50 right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you know what happens when you turn 50?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's time to get a colonoscopy okay.  Do you know what that is?
PATIENT: That uh, through your rectum?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You ever have that done before?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So when was the last time you had one?
PATIENT: It's been a while back.
DOCTOR: More than 10 years ago?
PATIENT: I don't remember, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you take an aspirin?
PATIENT: Yeah I still take the one aspirin that they give me.  You know they give me uh it's a real high potency aspirin but its real tiny like baby aspirin.
DOCTOR: Why did they do a colonoscopy in the past?
PATIENT: Well I think it, I don't think I had one, I don't think I had one I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: No? Okay.  Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Yeah maybe less than, about maybe during the daytime I might smoke maybe five or six cigarettes.  So a lot of places I go, it's no smoking so you know I be going, like I say I be occupied most of the time and the places you go, like where I sleep we can't smoke, there's no smoking except during break time when you be outside and a little patio outside they got a patio and you smoke out there but you know most of the time I'm there you have groups and we always, they always put me, my time's always lots of time I don't smoke that much.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You're gonna have to [REDACTED] paper [REDACTED] and get your colonoscopy okay.  That way we can check for colon cancer.  Cause I think, let's see.  Then you're gonna see the eye doctor soon right?
PATIENT: Yes.  Now I haven't seen, I used to go to them uh every you know every month and [REDACTED] Lakeside so um once [REDACTED] Lakeside I stopped getting my [REDACTED] and I was telling them I had a kind of like blurry vision sometime and uh that's when they put me in for you know [REDACTED], that was the last time I was in the hospital.  She got me an appointment to see them, I got [REDACTED] that’s the earliest they can see me.
DOCTOR: So it looks like you have an appointment right?
PATIENT: Yeah I have one.
DOCTOR: You have one on the 10th.  I see that.  So why don't I, will you please have a seat.

DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath.  Again.  Again.  Again.  Good.  One more time.  Breathe normal.  Any belly pain?
PATIENT: No [REDACTED].
