DOCTOR: Were you sick before the coughing just started?  I mean did you feel like you got really sick and then you just had the cough that kind of hung around or no?

(DOCTOR OUT: 41:11  DOCTOR IN:  50:53)
DOCTOR: Hi PATIENT.
PATIENT: How you doing?
DOCTOR: Good, good, good.  I'm DOCTOR, one of the supervising doctors.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So you are in pretty good health?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Cool. But you've been coughing.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And you teach, you're a teacher?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Great.  Um where do you teach?
PATIENT: Uh I work as a substitute teacher so uh I go to a lot of different schools.  My area is secondary social studies.
DOCTOR: Gotcha, gotcha.  Um and um do you live with family or by yourself?
PATIENT: By myself.
DOCTOR: Alright and um how have you been feeling generally?  I mean do you feel like you're in good health, do you feel like you're?
PATIENT: I feel that I'm in good health.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But now, for this last month I've been pretty miserable from the cough and it's just uh.
DOCTOR: And have you had a cold with that?
PATIENT: There was a cold with it as well.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Besides, I'm probably all healed from the cold.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: None that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay um and um have you ever had a cough like this before?
PATIENT: Yes.  I was diagnosed with acid reflux.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: In 2008.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And so [REDACTED] things like that, a dry hacking cough before.
DOCTOR: Yeah. Do you know what brings it on?
PATIENT: I'm not sure, I think it’s related to acid reflux.  Um in early 2005 I had a really bad cough.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Like this.  It could have been a reaction from the flu shot, I'm not entirely sure.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] now.
PATIENT: No I'm fine.
DOCTOR: So you think it was seasonal, does it happen at certain times of the year?
PATIENT: More often in winter than other times.
DOCTOR: Does cold air bring it on?
PATIENT: It could.  It sure could.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um cause I'm wondering some people get a little bit of asthma with the cold air.
PATIENT: And now that I think of it, when I'm exposed to cold air I have a tendency to cough more.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  [REDACTED] Can you lean forward?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Good.  Take a breath in, out, again, out hard, out hard, breathe deep, out, one more time out.  Okay keep going in and out, that's good, again.  Alright that’s good.  I don't hear a wheeze.  [REDACTED].  What I'm really wondering is would he benefit from, could he be having like a mild cough variant to reactive airway disease which people get in the winter.  I know kids get it all the time.  Um have you ever used an inhaler before?
PATIENT: I've tried it yeah before, but it's been a really long time.
DOCTOR: Okay.
DOCTOR: Do you want to do the inhaler?
DOCTOR: Yeah, try that and [REDACTED] prn.  Albuterol with a spacer; basically it's just a dilator, bronchodilator.
PATIENT: Uh-huh,
DOCTOR: Cause personally I don't think reflux would be causing this particular kind of cough and you know, it just doesn’t seem right.  Um I don't think he's got tuberculosis.  Uh I don't think he's got, it doesn’t really fit for allergies.  It’s been a little bit long for post-viral cough, but you know you could have this pattern of getting this in the wintertime, I would try him with just an inhaler – see if it helps.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Because you know you have to have a very significant amount of you know of bronchospasms before you start to wheeze, it's not from your actual cough.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we're going to try you on an inhaler.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And see if that doesn't actually help.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then maybe we'll see you back in a couple weeks and see how you're doing.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Good luck.
PATIENT: Thank you doctor.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And he's from Internal Medicine?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.  He's really knowledgeable.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Can you go down and pick up the medication?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um in the Pharmacy and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we'll have you come back in a month.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And we can see how your cough is doing.
PATIENT: Do I have an appointment for a chest x-ray?
DOCTOR: No you don't have to do a chest x-ray.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
