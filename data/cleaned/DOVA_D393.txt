PATIENT: That is correct.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you doing pretty good today otherwise?
PATIENT: For the most part.
DOCTOR: Alright sounds good.  Um you know this is going to be my first time seeing you so I'm just going to take a few seconds here to look through your chart a little bit okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um [REDACTED].  So uh I heard you were in the hospital for a little bit but before that, like when was the last time you saw a gen med doctor?
PATIENT: Uh the last time I saw a Gen. Med. doctor could have been seven or eight months ago maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  Was it here or?
PATIENT: Uh it was at Hines.
DOCTOR: At Hines.  Let's see if I can find that information.  Okay, so I understand you have high blood pressure, diabetes.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um anything else?
PATIENT: High cholesterol.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh that's about it.  That's enough.
DOCTOR: Fair enough.  So you were in the hospital for quite a bit, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What were you doing here, what were you here in for?
PATIENT: Uh this time depression and substance abuse.
DOCTOR: Well what type of substance abuse did you use?
PATIENT: Cocaine.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When was your last use?
PATIENT: Uh November the 25th.
DOCTOR: Um how much did you use?
PATIENT: Quite a big.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] okay.  Um let's see what about your depression, how’s that been?
PATIENT: Uh at the present I guess it's slowly getting better.
DOCTOR: I'm really glad to hear that.  It's a long process like anything worthwhile, you know with your substance abuse and your depression you need to take small steps okay hopefully over a long period of time you will notice an improvement you know.  Uh when were you discharged from the hospital?
PATIENT: Uh actually I was discharged from uh 7 East which is the Psych Unit two days ago.
DOCTOR: That's good.  So who do you live with?
PATIENT: Right now I'm inpatient for substance abuse now.
DOCTOR: Okay is that on the 9th floor.
PATIENT: Yes it is.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’m glad you’re here. Um so it sounds like somebody's looking in after you for your substance abuse and depression so I'll try to focus on other parts, okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um let me look through your labs and see how your sugars are doing.  Hmm.
PATIENT: They've been rising and falling.
DOCTOR: Yes they have.  We'll talk about that in a second.  And according to your blood pressure, have you been checking your blood pressure, on the psyche floor, or not really.
PATIENT: Uh yeah they did, on a daily basis.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED]  Someone at Hines you said was the last time you saw a [REDACTED] doctor.
PATIENT: That's correct.
DOCTOR: And [REDACTED] Chicago for a little bit.
PATIENT: I would think uh it was maybe some time in May.
DOCTOR: May of this year?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] Uh let me look over your medications real quickly here.  So insulin, you use Aspart.  How much before meals?
PATIENT: Uh for breakfast 15 units, lunch 18 units and for dinner 18 units.
DOCTOR: And the Glargine?
PATIENT: 50 units in the morning.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] perfect. And how long have you been in this regimen of insulin?
PATIENT: Uh for the most part I've been on that regimen I would like to say, I been on that type of insulin for about two, three years.
DOCTOR: Any the dosing?
PATIENT: The dose really hasn't changed much.
DOCTOR: Over the last three years?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let me ask you a question, be honest with me, you know cause it helps me take care of you, how good are you at taking this regimen.
PATIENT: Uh for the most part uh when I was working and my schedule being erratic I wasn't taking the insulin on a time basis.  Uh taking it a lot of times as needed or just before or after a meal and then at times had to adjust the dosage based upon what my blood sugars were running.
DOCTOR: Okay, fair enough.
DOCTOR: Um and I'm looking at your A1c right now.
PATIENT: And that's probably about 10.
DOCTOR: It's 12.
PATIENT: Ooh.  It needs to be about 7.
DOCTOR: Right.  Um your cholesterol is pretty good.  So that was checked a year ago.  So we checked that.  Your blood pressure is a little high.  Now what about your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Okay uh at one time I was on lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide and another blood pressure medication.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So right now you're on just the hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril.
PATIENT: I need the third other blood medication cause it's been running constantly high without it. Let's see what was it, everything has changed here.  I had been on three medications for years but that's recently been changed and I think they changed it just because I bottomed out at one time.  I bottomed out because of the fact that I was dehydrated.
DOCTOR: You're a type I diabetic?
PATIENT: Yeah I take insulin.  Uh that's been on uh, that baffles me sometimes.  He said my diabetes was onset after I became an adult.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh and at one time they said it was type 2, and then type 1 meaning my pancreas doesn't produce anything, is that correct?
DOCTOR: Uh not exactly [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Or my body is not regularly using insulin officially.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  And looking back for years, though I only see your hydrochlorothiazide and uh lisinopril, I don't see anything else.
PATIENT: Uh go back to, go back to 2007, amlodipine and before [REDACTED] they changed from something else before amlodipine.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].  So are you taking your blood pressure medications regularly?
PATIENT: Yes sir I am.
DOCTOR: Hydrochlorothiazide and the lisinopril?
PATIENT: That's right.  And right it could be high because I'm under constant stress.
DOCTOR: Well let me ask you this question.  Do you think we should add that third agent today or do you want to come back in a few weeks and see if it's still high and then add another one?
PATIENT: Uh maybe we need to add that third agent uh and just based on that I have the diabetes and high blood pressure and stress a predisposition to be able to have a heart attack.
DOCTOR: Absolutely.  I'm glad you knew that.  Um well how often do you check your sugars during the day?
PATIENT: Uh three times a day.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you have a log with you or do you have your machine with you?
PATIENT: No I don't have a machine, oh I need a machine [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How have you been checking them without a machine?
PATIENT: Uh I've been checking them on the Unit with their machine.
DOCTOR: What have they been running, do you have a log with it?
PATIENT: No I don't have the log of this but I can tell you uh as of late, I don't think I've been over 230 and uh a lot of times I've been running right around the 150s.  If you check from November 27th on, while I was on 7 East they should have it in there, what they've been running.  Is that there?
DOCTOR: Yeah, some of the blood sugars.
PATIENT: What do they look like.  Can you pull up the graph?
DOCTOR: So I think it's [REDACTED] kind of.
PATIENT: Erratic.
DOCTOR: No I was a little more concerned that you don’t [REDACTED].  Granted someone is taking it for you while you're in the hospital right now um but [REDACTED] tough about diabetes [REDACTED] physician can only do so much.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] kind of has to be personal type of drive to do better.
PATIENT: Vanish it. To eat better.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: A see a low there, a 57 something?
DOCTOR: 76 on the 5th and a [REDACTED] on the 4th.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: 111 during the day.  It's 10 o'clock in the morning.
PATIENT: Oh you know what I'm concerned about, I'm supposed [REDACTED] I could take it at nighttime and then when I wake up in the morning it's higher.
DOCTOR: Excuse me?.
PATIENT: I could take it at night, 9 at night and then when I take it at 6 in the morning it'll be significantly higher.
DOCTOR: Your sugar.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED], normal your body's going to [REDACTED] glucose [REDACTED] [REDACTED].  Alright give me one second um, there's a lot of stuff we could do for you.  Um I'm not sure we're going to be able to get it all done but, give me one sec I'm going to bring you back within a month or two to see me again again so we can try to fine tune some of this stuff okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  49:35  DOCTOR IN:  52:26)
DOCTOR: Alrighty, so a couple of things.  Um I want to show this to you real quick uh, let's see here, so hmm.  Now this is your A1c and you can date it back to 1989 12, 10, 11, 11, 12, 11, almost 12, 12.  So going back 10 years basically your sugars have not been controlled.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um I mean I know you've had some numbness already in your arms.
PATIENT: Uh-huh I've had a lot lately, ever since I've been taking the neuortin [REDACTED].  I guess for a while, cause I haven't had pain [REDACTED] a lot.
DOCTOR: I'm really glad to hear that um but um uh I have to tell you with levels of sugars in your body it won't be long before you start feeling more of the effects of your diabetes.  Your kidney function is okay right now but your kidneys can get, shut, shot up, you're right to worry about heart attacks, you're right to worry about strokes um, people start developing ulcers in their legs.  We can work on this uh, if you help we can rapidly get your sugar, there is no reason if you’re using insulin, why we can't bring your blood sugar down very rapidly to more [REDACTED] levels.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh so but you know I really am willing to help you along this process but again I'm helping you, I can't do it for you okay.  I just want to make it abundantly clear that these levels for ten years like this are completely unacceptable for a person on insulin uh.  If you're willing to do it, if we work together, within months your sugars could be much better okay.  Alright.  So right now I'm going to give you the Accu-Chek machine, all the supplies and have you keep a log and bring the machine back in basically so I can look at the sugars.  You need to check it at least three times a day, always in the morning and then the two other times can fluctuate.  Sometimes before meals, sometimes after meals but you have to note in your chart when it is.  Is it before meals or after meals.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh I'm not going to change anything with the insulin today because I'm concerned that I have better data to when I should change your insulin okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh but if you're getting low blood sugars consistently let us know right away so we can back off on your 60 units of Glargine or whatever, your Aspart okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's uh high sugars.  The high blood pressure, we'll add a tiny bit of amlodipine for you today, it's a really small amount, 2.5 okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you can take it once a day and see how it goes.  I'm bringing you back in two weeks to see the Pharm D.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And she'll see what your sugars do.
PATIENT: Uh I'm concerned; I'm concerned because uh I've had lichen planus.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And right now I have two stubborn areas, right here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And well this area is not that bad but uh and uh.
DOCTOR: How long does it usually take for that to heal for you?
PATIENT: Okay if I get a shot of uh, what is that, I can't think of the name of the stuff right now, I don't know what it is.  Uh.
DOCTOR: Have you seen Derm recently?
PATIENT: I haven't seen Derm in a while.
DOCTOR: How long ago?
PATIENT: I haven't seen Derm probably here in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's send you back to them and have them take a look at it okay.
PATIENT: Okay and uh and my eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll send you back up to Ophtho and Podiatry as well alright.  Alright um two weeks [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh I forgot to tell you I had an aneurysm in my left eye last year.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you’ll see the Pharm D, you'll see me back in two months.  I'll put in a consult for you so that you see the eye doctors, Dermatology and the foot doctors.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright but uh the amlodipine is the only thing I'm changing today and continue everything else. And I’ll order the supplies for  you.
PATIENT: So I'll see you back in.
DOCTOR: Two months.
PATIENT: Two months okay.
DOCTOR: Thank you sir.
PATIENT: Alright thank you.  Do I just go to the Pharmacy and pick up the amlodipine?
DOCTOR: Um go up front so they make that appointment for you um.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then after that pick up the supplies for your Accu-Chek and the amlodipine.
PATIENT: Okay thanks.
PATIENT: 58:03
