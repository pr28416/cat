DOCTOR: OK, yeah. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: Maybe as a kid. I mean, I remember getting the flu. I had a cough and that sort of thing, but I haven't been sick for several years now.
DOCTOR: OK. Umm, and then since you started having this cough too, now has anything changed? How are you feeling worse? Or do you feel kind of the same as when it started?

DOCTOR: OK. But no cigarettes though?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: OK, any other recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: OK, and do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Umm, I do, yeah, I'll have like two or three beers on the weekend.
DOCTOR: Sure. And and where do you live?
PATIENT: I'm just like 20 minutes down the road in a house here.
DOCTOR: Sure, is it an apartment complex or is it like a full house?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's a single family home. I live there with my wife and three kids.
DOCTOR: OK, um any concerns with your living arrangements you know, like old carpets or anything like that?
PATIENT: Actually last year we had most of the carpets taken out, so not anymore.
DOCTOR: OK good good. Did you have any other questions or concerns? Anything that you wanted to bring up that I didn't touch on today?
PATIENT: Yeah, I was just really worried that this could be COVID. I mean I have a cough and just have been feeling really hot so I was just concerned about that.
DOCTOR: Yeah, for sure, and I think that's a valid concern. So right now I'm just going through, you know, a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and COVID, it's definitely top on my list and so we will likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can. It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so. Until then, we will run all these labs. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright, yeah, that sounds good, so I guess I will kind of self isolate until the COVID results come back.
DOCTOR: Oh yes please do so. That's that's a great point. I do suggest isolating for two weeks at least if you have any sort of symptoms, because even though the PCR that we do to test for COVID is supposed to be reliable and it's supposed to be specific and sensitive, there are sometimes false negative tests. You know, just to be on the safe side, if you're experiencing any of the symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, isolate for two weeks. But by the end of the week we should know what the test results are and then you will know for sure what you have.
PATIENT: OK, awesome, thank you.
DOCTOR: Yeah, thank you.
