DOCTOR: Well, are you, feeling run down?  Do you have any muscle aches?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I always do.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I understand.  Are you having any muscle aches?  [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: I don’t think so, except for the usual, shoulder and neck and back.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright so you haven't seen Cardiology for a little while have you?  May.  You're getting [REDACTED] Toprol, lisinopril.  [REDACTED].  25 to 30% [REDACTED] still low.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] therapy.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] 20%.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].  Are you having any changes in heart beats, any more shortness of breath, any chest pain at all?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath is normal, you know, I move too fast, that’s my problem.
DOCTOR: How far do you have to walk before you’re short of breath?
PATIENT: It varies.  When I walk in from the parking lot, a pretty good walk so I walked real slow which is unnatural for me and I wasn't gasping for air and like I say, from my living room to my car, which is like 10 or 15 feet, I’ll be gasping.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] physical therapy, I must move too fast [REDACTED] gasping like that.
DOCTOR: How many stairs can you go up?
PATIENT: I don’t know. I think [REDACTED] just move too fast causes real shortness of breath.  What I got to do [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No swelling and no chest pain?
PATIENT: Na.
DOCTOR: Still smoking?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: How much?
PATIENT: Between a half and three quarters.
DOCTOR: How much is in a pack?
PATIENT: 10-15 a day.
DOCTOR: And you don’t want to talk about that.
PATIENT: No don't.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, alright, that's okay.
PATIENT: And I do, I know what I have to do and [REDACTED] it’s not your fault.  And how much longer do I have you doc?
DOCTOR: Um at the end of May [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But you are still gonna be here right?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So actually in June I won't be necessarily here but starting July 1st I'll be [REDACTED] so I'll be around.  You just pop your head in [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] I sit in that room there.
PATIENT: So I'm not gonna see you.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: One more time maybe?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can come back in May if you want, you might.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You don’t want to see me that bad. (laughs)
PATIENT: But I do want to see you [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well [REDACTED] I know.  I love to try and get you tuned up a bit.  [REDACTED] any concerns.  You're not having any muscle aches [REDACTED] or did you know that.
PATIENT: I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean you know I'm out of shape and all and that doesn't help you know.  I don't think anything out of the ordinary, as I say, my neck and shoulders and back [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well we need to talk about something.  You know your statin medicines.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know your statin medicine for your cholesterol.  Okay the simvastatin.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And remember, we decreased the dose because [REDACTED] liver function tests.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And um it can cause liver, it's not only your liver function tests, it's also your muscle enzymes.  Your liver is actually fine so the statins can cause your muscles to really ache okay and sometimes we can check on the blood level of your muscle enzymes and some people who [REDACTED] have a normal muscle enzyme level and some people have an elevated muscle enzymes with no muscle aches.  And you have an elevated muscle enzyme level and you're on the medicine that's probably causing that okay.  So there's a problem when the, when the medicine causes symptoms but this medicine isn't only causing you symptoms, it's causing the abnormal labs.
PATIENT: Why is that?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] get that so, we need to know if you have any muscle aches.  Cause if you're having muscle aches you should stop the medicine but right now, the risks of you getting muscle aches because your muscle enzyme is up is so low, but the risk of you getting a heart attack, with your cholesterol level is much higher.  Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: So we have to kind of weigh the risks and the benefits here.  But that's why you need to know your cholesterol medicine is causing your liver enzymes to go up a little tad.  Which I'm not worried about.
PATIENT: Now can they get lower, did it come down at all?
DOCTOR: So yes, if you come down definitely and then when you went back on it, a little bit, it went back up a tad okay.  You've always had high, so that's why I'm not so worried about it okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It was 280 back in 2001 and it went up to 443 and now it's 376 so I'm not really concerned about it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, not at all.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] liver problems, this is not your liver; it's your muscle enzymes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Does that make sense?
PATIENT: So if you're not concerned I'm not worried about it.
DOCTOR: I’m not. I think we should stick right with …
PATIENT: Cause you know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: I think we should stick right at the 40.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Especially if you're not having muscle aches.  If you have muscle aches, then we need to rediscuss it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] Claritin, right?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And you’re still on the allopurinol?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And uh your back pain, it looks like you saw Ortho and Pain Clinic.
PATIENT: Yeah, and I haven’t heard anything from them yet.
DOCTOR: So your EMG looks okay.
PATIENT: That is the nerve test, that looks good?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] so that's good, very good. They are following you in the clinic. You had some recent x-ray.  When are you going back there, let’s see, we don't have that scheduled and then you have a Neurology appointment too.
PATIENT: In May.
DOCTOR: In May so that'll be good.  I think you should just continue the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The depression, you're taking the Wellbutrin twice a day.  You're off the venlafaxine.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] still taking.
DOCTOR: You are still taking it.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'm sorry the [REDACTED] you're off of.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um so DOCTOR said in his note that he wants to increase your venlafaxine but it can increase your blood pressure and he wanted me to comment about that, saying that he thinks it’s most ideal for you that you go up on your venlafaxine.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I think that's definitely fine.  I'm going to put in my notes and send it to him and you can tell him too that DOCTOR says it's okay to go up on the venlafaxine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If your blood pressure goes up because of the venlafaxine, we'll take care of it okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Or your next doctor will.  That's no problem.  I can make your blood pressure [REDACTED] with medicine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: What I can't do is make you mentally better without medicine okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Good.  Health maintenance wise, you're gonna be due for a colonoscopy next year.
PATIENT: Has it been 10 years already, really?
DOCTOR: It's due in 2001.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Time flies when your colon is not good.  And then you'll be due for a tetanus shot next year okay.  [REDACTED] you can, I'm going to put all of this in here, there won't be a problem.  They'll be able to look at everything that's been done and we have it all right here.
PATIENT: Yeah but they're not going to be as good as you.
DOCTOR: I don't know, I hope so.  Your pneumonia shot won't be due for two years okay and they'll go through this with you.  You should get a flu shot every single year and you know, I feel like a failure for not getting you to stop smoking.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight [REDACTED] because I did not get you to stop smoking.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  You do everything you can.
DOCTOR: And the last, I'm going to get on my soap box and you're only 60 years old, if you live to 75 [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's the worst addiction known to man.
PATIENT: No kidding, you aren't kidding.
DOCTOR: No I mean really.
PATIENT: People think it's hard to get off drugs.  I don't know.  I know I have to and there’s that little 1% [REDACTED].  And I hate it.  99% of these, boy let's quit right now.  That 1%.
DOCTOR: Well.
PATIENT: Are we going to do anything about this [REDACTED] stuff now.
DOCTOR: Well you know we could [REDACTED] fevers or chills, it's probably just a virus.
PATIENT: It’ll go away.
DOCTOR: We [REDACTED] fluids, hydration and over-the-counter cough medicine.
PATIENT: Let me know.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna listen to your lungs, if your lungs are clear.  If you're not having fevers and you're not coughing up blood, [REDACTED] virus.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you start feel like shit, then come back [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I [REDACTED] let you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah definitely.  If you start to feel really bad then that's different.  You might have pneumonia, but it sounds like.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] please don’t say that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] almost died last time.
DOCTOR: You just need to know that [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know.  Well you need to know that sometimes viruses can turn into pneumonia.  And if that’s the case, come back to the ER.
PATIENT: It's still a little high on this end.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] the ER.  I know, I remember looking at that [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] You know how pneumonia kills people, [REDACTED].  Who does pneumonia kill?
PATIENT: Smokers.
DOCTOR: Ding, ding, ding, ding.
PATIENT: You know what though you're not gonna believe this.
DOCTOR: What?
PATIENT: I never had no problem breathing until I that pneumonia [REDACTED] hospital.
DOCTOR: You see [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I never got asthma, I never short of breath.
DOCTOR: It's all about the scarring in your lungs.  You're scarring your lungs every single day with cigarettes okay.  Every day you're scarring a little bit of your lungs.
PATIENT: But you know what I'm saying.
DOCTOR: When you get pneumonia, your big scar happens in your lungs okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: A big scar, you have a big infection, [REDACTED] infection, if you get an infection in your hand or your toe or something like that or it's in your lungs.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The infections a scar and so it's, the reason you get bacteria is because you're bringing it in with the smoke and with the toxins that get in there and cause infection so that's why smokers scar more, smokers get more infections that scar more and you know people who get repeated pneumonia they start chipping off their lung volumes.
PATIENT: How come you never smoked?
DOCTOR: Why have I not ever smoked?  Cause I want to live.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I've got my vices, trust me.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh no, no one else's.
PATIENT: Well that's it, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I know [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I was an alcoholic with drinking and smoking [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know, trust me I have a lot of issues with my family and I have some [REDACTED] smoke but I mean it never was an option for me because I knew.  I mean I'm not gonna lie to you, I've had a cigarette or two in my life outside and everything like that.
PATIENT: Oh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But it's a thing, kind of like why do this to myself and I know it's hard.  I know it's hard but you can do it.  I know you can do it.  You're a slave to your cigarettes.  Deep breath.  And it's expensive.  Look how much money you've had.
PATIENT: Well, that's why I only [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: (Laughter)  that’s your strategy?
PATIENT: Well, because when the day is over [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Financially uh it's a benefit for you financial to date people with cigarettes?  I'm sorry, any swelling.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any belly pain?
PATIENT: No
DOCTOR: Blood in the stools?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Vomiting, [REDACTED] or anything like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Nope.  Well alright my friend I don't have anything for you today.
PATIENT: Well I guess that's good news.
DOCTOR: That's good news.  Alright.
PATIENT: And you just tell me where to drop in and say hi.
DOCTOR: Alright I will.  So I'll have you [REDACTED] four months [REDACTED].  Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] then you’ll be due for labs after you see the new doctor in four months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and um I think we've covered everything.  Um you will need to stay seeing Mental Health.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And they’ll increase your medicine and we can go up on the blood pressure medicine if we need to.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And um um and let's just real quick, just so we can kind of talk about it, do you know what the signs of heart failure are?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Let's talk about that.  So [REDACTED] you need to come back and see DOCTOR or whoever come to the ER, if you start getting short breath just getting here, you need to come in.  If you start swelling up, you need to come in.  If you gain four pounds in one day you need to come in.
PATIENT: Ah I can do that.
DOCTOR: You can do that, okay.  Well if you start gaining weight, on a daily basis.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You gain four pounds and all of a sudden you're just ten pounds up, that's water for you, that's not food.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  No matter what you’ve been eating.  If you start finding that you have to sit in a recliner to sleep because you can't sleep laying down on pillows, that's heart failure okay.  If you find that you know I used to be able to go up one flight of stairs and I didn't have to stop in the middle due to short of breath but now I can't even climb a few stairs without getting short of breath, that's heart failure okay.  Those are all signs of heart failure, and you need to come in.  You've got a little bit of a weak heart here.  You’ve chipped away at your heart muscles too with a heart attack.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And stuff so we need to just keep that in tune.  One more thing I want to talk to you, I think I talked to you about this before is that you have a little bit or your heart function is less than 30% and what we know with people with heart function less than 30% is and some other details that we know that sometimes they can benefit from a defibrillator.  We can put a little tiny box in your heart that if your heart would have stopped it would restart it.  Cause what we know is people with heart failure, when they die, you die suddenly.  Sudden cardiac death is what we call it and it’s just because your heart has an abnormal rhythm [REDACTED].  And what we know is that people will live longer with heart failure if we put in something in their heart to shock it.  You see those defibrillators that you know the schools have and they have them in the airports and stuff like that in hospitals, that's what this is but it's in you already.
PATIENT: How come nobody has mentioned that before?
DOCTOR: Well it’s just something to talk about  I mean it's like you need to get back and see your cardiologist because we repeated a few echoes and it still shows that your heart function is a little bit low okay and it's right on the cusp definitely but I do want to make sure you have every benefit that you have that you can get to help this.  Alright, you're right on the cusp and obviously you're doing so good I would be hesitant to do that but I think that you deserve a discussion with them okay, a defibrillator is what that is.  Alright cause I'd hate to see you coming back here with you know your heart stopped and then a problem restarting it and it's too late [REDACTED] when we could have had this discussion before and it could have potentially saved your life, okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I want you to see the cardiologist again to discuss that next time.  There's no hurry.  This isn't an emergency or nothing like that.
PATIENT: I've never seen a cardiologist.
DOCTOR: Yeah you have.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: In May.
PATIENT: So I don't have one.  I mean why did I see him in May?
DOCTOR: Because you have significant heart disease.  You have enough heart disease that you can see a cardiologist once every, every year or so.
PATIENT: I agree.
DOCTOR: Okay, so I want you to make an appointment with a cardiologist [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You can't put it in there already?
DOCTOR: No because the [REDACTED] get a new one.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: If they're not here, you'll need to get a new one.
PATIENT: So if I saw him in May would they automatically set one up in May or no?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Just tell them that you said that.
DOCTOR: He wrote that in there too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  That it's 30% and [REDACTED].  The defibrillator is not for everybody.  It's a surgical procedure but I think it's something that I think that you should have a conversation about [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] for you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alrighty?
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No what do I have to do [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah right now.
PATIENT: The one I came out of.
DOCTOR: Yep it's the one right there.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yep.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: 43:48
