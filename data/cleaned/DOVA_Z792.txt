SECOND PERSON Z792
Cause he takes another one at noon time a different one.  But when he gets the bloody nose his blood pressure went way up, it may have well been because of the stress he was under. It was over 200.

PATIENT: I'm not sure where we're at.
SECOND PERSON Z792

He'd only had that pneumonia when he went into the hospital.  [REDACTED] when he was in there you they noticed that he went into atrial fibrillation so the doctor said  - took a heart test.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Which he had where they went in through the groin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z792
That test and a couple days later he was in terrible, terrible pain in his groin.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
And then he started bleeding.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
I'm sure it was coming from that.
DOCTOR: Yeah what did they do for him?
SECOND PERSON Z792
Well they put him, they took him down and they found that he was bleeding.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
And so they gave him four units of blood.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED] in his record.  He had four units of blood.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z792
And um, and that's about all and then they released him to therapy another week later and released him to Fairview Veterans Home.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  So when did he come back from Fairview?
SECOND PERSON Z792
Uh the, I think it was the 11th of December.
PATIENT: I came home, I was released.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.
DOCTOR: So he bled, he needed four units of blood before he went to Fairview.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Right.
DOCTOR: Then he came home and you guys saw DOCTOR and she checked his blood count.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yes.
DOCTOR: So his blood count was low compared to where it had been in the past?
SECOND PERSON Z792
Wasn't it 9 something?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah that's what it is here I got.  I also have a report just from um.
DOCTOR: So maybe, so you had some that were in the 9s and then one of them was up to close to 13 and then back down to 9.7 again and so.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well.
SECOND PERSON Z792
How come it goes.
DOCTOR: This one doesn't really need, I mean all of the other were in the same range [REDACTED] than that one but as you can see that maybe a year and a half ago he was up to 11 and 12.
SECOND PERSON Z792
He was at 11 when he went into the hospital.
DOCTPR Z792
Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
The records shows 11 something when he went into the hospital.
DOCTOR: Yeah well we can recheck his blood count today to make sure that it's stable.  Have you had any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: They just gave me three tests.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah you haven't had those, brought those in yet.
PATIENT: Yeah I haven't turned them in yet.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED] he had to finish the dialysis.
PATIENT: But they're all completed ready to turn in.
DOCTOR: Okay from the Dialysis Lab okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
They're going to look at him too.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z792
So we could have them sent here.
DOCTOR: Yeah, could you do that?
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yes.
DOCTOR: To DOCTOR?
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay and then the other thing is, you know, how long have you been on dialysis?
PATIENT: Oh long time.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Seven years [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Seven years.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Seven, seven and half years.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you know anywhere between 10 and 12, really is an okay hemoglobin.  Patients who are on dialysis are anemic because they are, you know you have to take a replacement with dialysis and your kidneys help you keep your blood [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON Z792
But he feels so weak.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z792
He still has a hard time standing up cause he's weak and I wondered if that groin has healed, if it’s healed because while he's been home.  He's been home since.
PATIENT: The 11th.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED] the 11th of December and still has a real hard time standing up because of the severe weakness and I just wondered if that’s healed.
PATIENT: I'm not making any progress.
SECOND PERSON Z792
He just doesn't seem to be getting better.  He's still real weak.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Is he still getting any rehab?
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yes, he gets Home Health.
DOCTOR: Home rehab.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah home rehab.
DOCTOR: How many times a week?
SECOND PERSON Z792
Twice.
DOCTOR: Twice a week okay and then what is his activity level in between the rehab program?
SECOND PERSON Z792
Uh he does the exercises; he has weights and will lift the weights.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
And he also uh, he walks.  He walks our condo has the hallways and he walks there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
And we went once, last Saturday, we went to the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED] we [REDACTED] had rail.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
But he just doesn't seem to be getting his strength back and it's really tough.
DOCTOR: You know it takes some time and then on top of that would be the anemia.  I don't know where his counts are now but being anemic makes you feel weak or makes you weak.  You know when you're anemic and having all the previous medical problems that he's had and then you know being so deconditioned where he needed the rehab all of that kind of combines.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.
DOCTOR: And it just takes a long time to get better.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But um, when was the last time that he saw DOCTOR the hematologist?
PATIENT: Uh.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Not too long ago before that, probably September or October.  It was shortly before.
PATIENT: I haven't seen him since I left the.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Not since he's been sick.
PATIENT: Since I went to.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay this is right after he got out of the hospital and that's from the – they did at where he gets dialysis.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
For the dialysis.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's before I went to.
SECOND PERSON Z792
That's before you went to .
PATIENT: Before I [REDACTED] into uh.
SECOND PERSON Z792
No that was after you came home, like the 12th or 13th, you came home on the 11th and you had dialysis the next day I think.  [REDACTED] but they do it once a month.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well I thought I left since I went into.
SECOND PERSON Z792
To Fairview.
PATIENT: No, well certainly before I went into Fairview but before going to see, two weeks.
SECOND PERSON Z792
And that's before you went to the hospital.
PATIENT: Yeah I saw that.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Which one?
PATIENT: Good Samaritan Hospital.
DOCTOR: Hmm okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
That's another thing, concerned, because he had such bad bloody noses and then he had the breathing problem.  He has a breathing problem.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Is there any indication of?
DOCTOR: No not, he hasn't had any bleeding recently correct?
SECOND PERSON Z792
Last week.
DOCTOR: Right.  But outside of that, after he saw the ENT, the nose surgeon.
SECOND PERSON Z792
No that's right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So you know once he follows with them, as long as you know he's not still bleeding from that same point and then um his anemia is most likely from his kidney disease [REDACTED] labs.  (phone rings, doctor answers)  Okay.  I'm just going to do a quick exam here.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Is there anything they can do to build up his blood?
DOCTOR: Um.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Cause his iron is lower than 2.
DOCTOR: So the kidney doctors sometimes recommend for IV iron infusion but um and DOCTOR is a blood doctor too.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Oh too.
DOCTOR: So I think.
SECOND PERSON Z792
So I should try to get another appointment with him?
DOCTOR: I think so.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Or even with the kidney docs to ask them if they think the IV, getting iron through them.  Because right now, is he on an iron supplement?
SECOND PERSON Z792
No. [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Yeah so um you know we need to know that the bleeding isn't coming from the rectum and that he's not bleeding internally because you don’t want to just treat someone with iron if the blood might be going somewhere else.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Right.
DOCTOR: But that’s why we need to know what his counts are to make sure that they're stable.  But if it's stable, if everything is stable and it looks like you know he's anemic because he is chronically ill and on hemodialysis then you know IV iron could be you know an option other than the iron tablets.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED] so he never has gone back up since before he went to the hospital.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z792
And he was given blood; it never went all the way back up.
DOCTOR: Yeah, right.  That's why, so if you look at the trends of his hemoglobin, I can show you here.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Going back and forth.
DOCTOR: It's kind of back and forth.  Over the last you know year and a half or so, but even maybe a year ago he was still in the 9s.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Oh.
DOCTOR: So even though he's 9.7, that's not different from where he was almost a year ago in March of last year he was 9.6.  The big question is here from you know June of 09 to then September of 09, when he went from 12 to about the 9 in March 2010.  But since March of 2010 [REDACTED] he's been in the same range as he is now.  This out liner here.
SECOND PERSON Z792
It just used to be that he can't get his strength back [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You’re correct, yeah.  [REDACTED] can really be hard.  But being a kidney patient, being a dialysis patient, you don't really shoot for high goals like that for that, 12, 13 because you have the understanding that he's a kidney patient.
PATIENT: And that controls everything.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  So you know that's a good question that you have but you know some oral iron supplements or IV iron infusion you know twice a week or something like that could help with his anemia.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED] we’ll get an appointment with DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Yep, okay.  Can you lean forward?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay great.  Deep breath.  Okay deep breath.  Okay.  Okay.  Alright.  A little bit of swelling here.  Let's see this one.
SECOND PERSON Z792
The other one really [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: When was his dialysis?  The last dialysis?
SECOND PERSON Z792
Monday.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright, his blood pressure is okay.  How much fluid did they pull off?  Do you know?  How much fluid?
PATIENT: No I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's okay.  Alright.
SECOND PERSON Z792
[REDACTED] certain weight and get him down to that certain weight.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
So and this is also, yeah this is new too, yeah that is new and this [REDACTED] is new.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
That happened at ear nose and throat.
DOCTOR: So that's on there.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yes.
PATIENT: I’m way in and way out.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay now the one thing, the other question I do have, if you look at, if you go back, I'll need those back.
DOCTOR: Yep I'm going to bring those right back to you.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Um when you look at here, his cholesterol is 98. And he’s on statin drugs. Does he really need that many drugs [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah for his total cholesterol. [REDACTED] I'm [REDACTED]; I'm not going to make too many changes without DOCTOR.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So I'm not going to change that medication.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.
PATIENT: I never really talked to DOCTOR.  I don’t believe.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah you had one visit with him.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I think we got a telephone call from him.
SECOND PERSON Z792
No we met with him.  We met once with him.  I don't think, why take so many statin drugs if you don't need them you know.
DOCTOR: Um but with his history you know just for protection to have those on board.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON Z792
Maybe [REDACTED] going on.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Could be enough.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll um, just keep taking them as you are and then I'll send DOCTOR a note to say that you guys want to decrease  your dose.  Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'll be back shortly.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  58:11  DOCTOR IN:  68:59)
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  So we're all done here for the day.  I'm going to have.
SECOND PERSON Z792
He needs some more refills on these four.
DOCTOR: Okay do you want 90 days or 30?  Let's just do the 90 and that'll last you for a while.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.
DOCTOR: So this is your list, here's the new list.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.
DOCTOR: This is the amlodipine 10 mg.  This came up at 5, because I hadn't signed the order.  I’m going to sign the order then it'll be changed.  All of this I'll give you 90 days on everything.  So like these refills, [REDACTED] ignore those, I’ll give you 90 days for everything and they'll be mailed to your house.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.  Now there's one, I don't know if it’s serious or not.  But there's one [REDACTED] except for this one we are out of it.  Will he be okay without that for a few days?
DOCTOR: Do you want to pick it up today?
SECOND PERSON Z792
He really should have it right?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Cause that's the one that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, the kidneys okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Well then let's get it.
DOCTOR: Pick that up from the Pharmacy today okay.
PATIENT: Do they close at a certain time?
DOCTOR: Yeah that's why um we need you guys heading down there.  So I'll renew everything but that one I'll say that you can pick it up today.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you need help putting this away?
SECOND PERSON Z792
No I'll put it in my bag here so I would.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z792
So I could carry it.
PATIENT: You got to get those four separated now.
SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah I'll put those away.  But it's okay because she's ordering it.
PATIENT: She's ordering all four of those?
SECOND PERSON Z792
