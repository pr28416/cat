DOCTOR: What did they say over there?
PATIENT: As soon as I walked in there, they gave me a diagnosis.
DOCTOR: What did they say?
PATIENT: Vertigo.
DOCTOR: Oh vertigo is [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The pills wasn't [REDACTED], I mean the pills [REDACTED].  Cause he had told me to leave the pills, don't take the pills and sent me back home.
DOCTOR: Which pills?

DOCTOR: [REDACTED] take the pills [REDACTED] vertigo.
PATIENT: I got me some [REDACTED].  But I want to know if I can get those.
DOCTOR: Yeah we can give you these.
PATIENT: Okay.  Cause those help my reflux.
DOCTOR: Reflux; let me put them in right now so I don't forget.  Did they give you anything at County for the vertigo?
PATIENT: Yeah they gave me [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] yeah.  [REDACTED] that's good [REDACTED].  Yeah if you don't get dizzy you don't have to take them.
PATIENT: No right.  I don't take them unless [REDACTED].  Yeah I had a history of vertigo before I had it real bad.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: This was a different case than what it was before.  Before the room had turned upside down.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: When I had it ten years ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh and now?
PATIENT: And now I get dizzy.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I mean I was.
DOCTOR: Yeah vertigo is one of those [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I walked with a cane for about a week.
DOCTOR: Well yeah, let me just [REDACTED] um do you want to pick it up or do you want us to just mail it?
PATIENT: I can pick it up.
DOCTOR: Pick it up.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I'll put in 11 refills.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] let me know I got an appointment for the, did you see that in there uh, gastro - what is it?
DOCTOR: Yeah, gastroenterologist.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They have this [REDACTED] once a day.  You're supposed to take it twice a day.
PATIENT: No I only take it once.
DOCTOR: You only take it once that helps you?
PATIENT: It helps a little bit but it don't, it look like at the end of the day, cause I take it in the morning.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So at the end of the day it’s starting to wear off.
DOCTOR: Yeah this is supposed to be twice a day so I'm gonna put it for twice a day.
PATIENT: Twice a day okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  That's the only difference.
PATIENT: And I monitor it, you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I’ll monitor it [REDACTED] yeah if I don't need it twice.
DOCTOR: It only works if you take it all the time though.  Like even, like if you don't take it for a couple days then uh the acid-blocking like what it does.
PATIENT: Cut back.
DOCTOR: You have to start all over again.
PATIENT: Uh no, no, let me take it every day.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you're supposed to take it twice a day, try and take it every day.
PATIENT: Twice a day okay.
DOCTOR: Because it helps the most when you're lying in bed um.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] that’s the most important time to take it because the acid is going up your esophagus, cause you're lying down.
PATIENT: Yeah so the acid is running back up.
DOCTOR: Right so that's [REDACTED].  Well I'm glad, the dizziness, the vertigo is such, everybody pretty much gets it, and all it is is that the inner ear.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Did they explain it to you like what's going on?
PATIENT: No I thought it was coming from an infection.
DOCTOR: Oh not.
PATIENT: Not necessarily.
DOCTOR: Not necessarily.
PATIENT: Necessarily yeah.
DOCTOR: Some people get it from an infection but most people get it just when there are these little stones in both of our ears.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: They tell our brains where we are like so right now you know you're sitting up.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You know you're not laying down.  You know that because there are these stones in the ear that stay down.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Most of the time, when they are in the right place.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And so we know that [REDACTED] up but sometimes what happens, for no reason, the stones just kind of can get out of whack.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Like one of them will go up here or go down here somewhere.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: And so then your brain gets confused and it's like well what's going on am I standing up, am I sitting down and just right or left.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you're kind of going in circles.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But usually this medicine kind of helps the brain to ignore the ears.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And so it tells it you know the ears messed up.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] the other one is I got the vertigo.
DOCTOR: Oh the vertigo right, right, yeah definitely right.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh so that's how that medicine helps and usually just with time, those stones just kind of get back in their place.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know you want to get out of the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Exactly.  There are some exercises you can do to kind of help speed it along.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Did they teach you those?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  Let me show you, so basically what you do is [REDACTED] first.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um but then after the the stones, like so basically what you're doing is just kind of shaking everything up.
PATIENT: Yeah trying to get it.
DOCTOR: In the right place again.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So this is what you do, and then in the morning when you wake up you just kind of go like this and then you – you go slower than I’m doing it - you want to wait like 10 seconds.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you go like this, I know it seems kind of silly but what you're doing is.
PATIENT: That's what I've been doing really, myself.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you just kind of do it three or four times and try to be a little bit slower than I'm going.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you just go like that, do that like in the morning and at bedtime
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And do this, probably like 10 reps of that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that should help.
PATIENT: Keep them on their side.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: Staying in place.
DOCTOR: Right exactly.  So.
PATIENT: I didn't know, I thought maybe it was infection or something like that.
DOCTOR: Sometimes that can cause it too but this will mostly.
PATIENT: He said I don't have an infection.
DOCTOR: Yeah you can tell that just by looking in the ear if he looked in your ear.
PATIENT: He looked in it yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah so he could tell so [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But other than that I'm doing alright.  Just that acid reflex [sic] you know.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] check your labs [REDACTED] labs done.
PATIENT: Right. [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Very good [REDACTED] problems [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah we can redraw them again today. They were all good las year. You see, there’s no abnormalities, your cholesterol was good, you kidneys are good, your liver is good.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We'll get them redrawn today.
PATIENT: They did an x-ray on me in the Emergency Room hod did that come out.
DOCTOR: A chest x-ray?  Yeah I see it was normal.
PATIENT: Is it?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Your lungs are clear.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It was normal.  That's good.  Let's see what else is here.  Okay are you still taking all these medicines that are on the list here?

DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Yeah we'll [REDACTED].  So you taking the Tylenol?
PATIENT: Not, unless I really need it.
DOCTOR: Just as needed.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What about the acyclovir?
PATIENT: That's for the stomach is that what it is?
DOCTOR: No it's for the, uh for the herpes.  Do you have it?
PATIENT: No I didn't get those pills.  They put them in but they never came.
DOCTOR: They never came.  I'll put them in.
PATIENT: Actually when I went over there to uh get them.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I think I told them to mail them and they ain't never come.
DOCTOR: Oh uh I'll refill them for you.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now they gave me a inhaler.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: In the Emergency Room what do you think about that?
DOCTOR: For the oh because at that time you were having a cough.
PATIENT: Cause I had that real bad cough, [REDACTED] that's another thing I had trouble with.  See when I got the cough, that’s probably what shook that stone up.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because I was coughing I couldn't stop, it was like the whooping cough.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's probably what it, yeah.
PATIENT: And after I got rid of that then the acid reflex [sic] was a combination with the cough.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that's why they gave me the pills here and then [REDACTED] that’s when vertigo hit that next week.
DOCTOR: That’s probably what it is.
PATIENT: Three weeks.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: For three weeks I was doing that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Nobody could stay around me [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] yeah.
PATIENT: You know I went from independent to dependent you know so at that time, you know I'm independent now.
DOCTOR: Yeah. I’m glad it’s doing better. It will continue to get better [REDACTED] right now.  Yeah if you don't, if you're not coughing you don't need it.  They just gave it to help you with the cough.
PATIENT: Okay.
