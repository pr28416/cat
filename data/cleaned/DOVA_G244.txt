PATIENT: About 250.
DOCTOR: 250 okay.  Um that's pretty high um.  Are you still taking all the same medications?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Let's see metformin um and that's pretty much the only one.  I thought that you were doing good with your diabetes.  Yeah last time we checked your A1c in September it was really good 6.2.  Okay um.  How many times a day do you check your sugars?
PATIENT: Once a day.
DOCTOR: Once a day okay.  Um and sometimes are they in the 100s?  Like 110 or they always like 200 something?

PATIENT: Usually I take it with the pills.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then I'll be fine.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  Okay um.  I'm going to make some notes; I'm going to put them in here.  Um okay, let's see alright so the other thing that sometimes we try for nerve pain like neuropathy.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is some medicine called gabapentin.  Have you ever tried that before?  It's a pill that you take three times a day and usually we start at the low dose and then increase it as you tolerate it um and it's supposed to help with nerve pain.  Um some people it helps, some people it doesn't.  I don't really know, you know we have no way of identifying who it would.  Would you want to try that?
PATIENT: Okay.  You gave me; a doctor gave me some type of salve.
DOCTOR: Oh some what?
PATIENT: Capsaicin.
DOCTOR: Oh some cream?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: A type of cream.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, okay.
PATIENT: That [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Did that help?  Have you been trying it?
PATIENT: I haven’t tried it.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, okay.  Yeah cause that stuff can help too with the neuropathy.
PATIENT: Really?
DOCTOR: Yeah definitely.  Everyone's different.  Some patients really like the cream, some people really like you know the gabapentin, it's a little bit different for everybody.   Do you want to try that first and if it doesn't work then we'll try the pills or do you want?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah let's do that.  You're on enough meds right now, so we'll just take it slow okay.  Um so it sounds like it's pretty painful so I don't want to like ignore it though.  Okay and then the other thing is the urination stuff.  You're going, so you're peeing a lot, what's the story?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  [REDACTED] I drink a lot of coffee.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, sure.  Uh how many times a night do you have to get up and use the bathroom?
PATIENT: About three or four.
DOCTOR: Three or four times a night.  That's interrupting your sleep isn't it?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah um and uh have you noticed that there's any change in the strength of the stream?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No change in the.
PATIENT: No changes.
DOCTOR: Are you still, is it that you have to go and pee do you have to wait a while for it to start?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So it's just peeing frequently.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No pain, that's good, that's good.  Um okay.  And yeah I mean definitely you're getting to the age where prostates do start interfering with men and so that's something we can take a look into.  Um okay.  Let's see alright okay.  Anything else bothering you?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: No okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'll just get all this paperwork filled out.  What's the story at home?  Are you, you know do you do got to [REDACTED] around the house or?

PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Home Health nurse or anything like that.  So you guys have it under control do you think?  Okay, okay that's good um okay great.  Well I'm going to do a physical exam.  I'm going to ask you gentlemen to step outside.  Um you can wait in the hallway or in the waiting area either one and um I'll uh call you back when we're done.
PATIENT: Sit here?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So I really want to check your prostate?   Have you had that done before?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: It's really not pleasant.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What we do is uh I put, I put a finger in your rectum and feel your prostate.
PATIENT: Oh.  I had that done; I had that done in the Army.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, you've had them before, you know what it's like.  The main thing about it is that I can feel your prostate and I can feel if there are any lumps or bumps, I can feel if it's bigger than normal.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um and it's something we should probably do so we'll do it now, sounds like you haven’t had it for a while, so that'll be good.  So it'll take only a second.  [REDACTED].  Okay.  Alright.  So we'll start with the prostate exam.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] Agent Orange.  [REDACTED] prostate [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah that can definitely.
PATIENT: I'm worried about that.  I had a friend of mine die from that.
DOCTOR: Oh really, I'm so sorry to hear that.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh I just need you to drop your pants and turn around and face that way and lean forward okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  Right here.
DOCTOR: Okay now turn around over there, can you face the wall for me, that'll be good yeah.  There we go.  Okay.  Alright.  So if you lean forward a little bit, perfect.  Okay so you're gonna feel me spreading your cheeks with the outside and then you'll feel a cold finger okay.  Well yeah okay alright good.  All done.  I'm gonna come back [REDACTED] so you can go ahead and clean up.  I'll be right back in okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  45:17  DOCTOR IN:  46:40)
DOCTOR: Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yeah I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Come on in.
DOCTOR: Huh yeah.  You guys can come back in.  Okay.  Um [REDACTED] yeah.  Okay.  Okay yeah, there you go.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] U.I.C.?
DOCTOR: Huh, um I'm doing residency here but I'm just going through [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Did you hurt at all [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay so uh basically, it didn't feel too crazy back there.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: That's the good news um yeah so I think that uh, you the prostate might be a little bit big uh but I didn't feel any lumps or bumps so that's good.  That means you know probably less likely  chance.
PATIENT: Of prostate cancer.
DOCTOR: Of a cancer yeah.  We can also do a blood test to look for cancer, it's uh not 100% test so sometimes it comes back low and people still have it.  Sometimes it comes back high and people don't have it but usually if it comes back high we like to investigate more.  Um we need to just send people to the urologist.  So is it okay if we check that blood test on you?
PATIENT: Today?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah well if we do blood we're able to do it today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  Um everything else.
PATIENT: They always have problems getting my blood.
DOCTOR: They always have problems getting your blood?
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: You're a hard stick.  We should give you and make you drink a bunch of water so your veins get all pumped up.  Yeah I know.  Everyone has their cross to bear, you got to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: One guy he's no good at all and the other guy he's no good.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But the young lady she always has problems.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Maybe you should try and get the guy.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Okay.
DOCTOR: Maybe she just hasn't been doing it as long.  Is she younger? Maybe she'[REDACTED] good job.
PATIENT: I gotta do something.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: Do I go give blood right here?
DOCTOR: Yeah, let me just double check everything else so um yeah.  So we'll recheck a prostate test and then we'll check again your A1c level, that's to check how your diabetes is doing.  Um I think that we were good on um your cholesterol um so we were dealing with that with the pharmacist, so I don't know if we need to check that but um we'll see about that and then the other things is, so we're not gonna start the medicine for the nerves cause you're gonna try the stuff the podiatrist gave you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  [REDACTED] type of thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  Try that stuff and if that works then we won't bother with the gabapentin.  If it doesn't work, at your next visit, we'll try the gabapentin okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Then we're not trying like six things at once and we'll know what's working and what isn't.  Um and then did you get your flu shot this year?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No okay well, it’s almost the end of flu season now.  Uh okay and then the um other thing we want to double check on is the uh the urination stuff.  So we can start medicine for that um you know that helps with the prostate.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um it might help you and so we might consider trying that, what do you think?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I think it would be nice if you didn't have to get up so many times at night you know.  I don't think it's just that you're drinking a lot of water cause you've probably been doing that through the years you know and it's more recently that this stuff has been coming up.  So why don't we try, we'll start that medicine.  Uh usually we start that medicine at a low dose and then we increase it over time okay.  I’ll give it to you in a starter pack and it'll say how to take it like 1 mg one week and 2 the next and so forth okay. Uh okay and then you want to, um providing you know the labs return normal, we'll have you come back in like three, four months.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um come back sooner if you need to, like if the salve doesn't work on your leg.
PATIENT: I'll be back on the 23rd.
DOCTOR: Oh the 23rd, for the Red Clinic?
PATIENT: No the Agent Orange Clinic.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, okay.
PATIENT: The [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  If you are not, if the salve isn't working on your foot you know, then come back and make an appointment to see us earlier.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Come back and see me in like April or May.
PATIENT: Well I did, I made an appointment to see you.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Cause I wanted to see you over here.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, no I'm glad.  I'm glad you came back.  Okay um I'll go put the lab, I'll put the lab work in and have you go over to the blood Lab but you know DOCTOR wants to see you first.  So let me go get her.  You guys sit tight and I'll be right back.  Okay.  That's good alright, thanks.
(DOCTOR OUT:  51:09  DOCTOR IN:  59:45)
DOCTOR: Hi.  You have a lot of friends with you, all family with you.
PATIENT: Yeah, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Okay PATIENT how are you?  Greetings.
PATIENT: I think I'll be alright.
DOCTOR: Two things um, the cholesterol medicine you're not taking any more so I don't know if you have the bottle at home or you ran out or what.
PATIENT: I think I ran out.  I called them about it.
DOCTOR: No we need to put the order in, so we're going to put the order in.  Um so but the cholesterol was pretty high last time it was checked so once you started taking it, it takes a couple of months to come back down so you do need to come and see our Pharmacy doctor in two months to make sure that its working and your cholesterol is down okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright and then the other issues you already talked with DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  Thanks DOCTOR.  Oh okay.  So we're gonna do a few things today.  We're gonna do the blood work.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um we're gonna have you schedule an appointment um for two months um with the Pharm D and you know that's here in Red Clinic.  Have you seen her before in the Pharm D?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and that's just a follow-up on your cholesterol.  The clerk will make that appointment um.  But you have to stop and tell her to make it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then go to the lab to do the blood work and then um we're gonna restart the cholesterol medicine.  Do you want to pick them up at the Pharmacy or do you want us to mail it to you?
PATIENT: They can mail it to me.
DOCTOR: Mail it to you okay.  So we're gonna mail you.
PATIENT: I called in for that and they told me it was on the way.
DOCTOR: Oh never came huh.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry about that.  It might be our fault that we didn't reorder enough of it or something you know and maybe it wasn't in there so we're gonna be putting you back on the same thing you were on simvastatin 80 mg each night and um then the other thing we're gonna mail you is the medicine for the prostate to see if that helps.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And that's called tamsulosin.  There's actually two medicines that we can use for the prostate, I don't know, you know if you've seen the commercials for them.  But one of them also can lower your blood pressure so we're not starting that one because your blood pressure's already good you know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So um, so usually you use those daily, I that'll do it so, triple check, yeah at bedtime so we'll start you on [REDACTED].  Okay.  Alright, so here's the plan.  Appointment with the Pharmacy in uh two months, make that appointment today, go to the Lab and give blood and then we'll mail you those medicines and start taking them okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then you'll come back and see us in the clinic in like three or four months.  We'll mail you a letter.  Um and to let you know I'm graduating so I won't be here after May.
PATIENT: No?
DOCTOR: No.  So there'll be a new doctor here in clinic.  Uh you'll still have DOCTOR so it'll be the same one.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But you'll have someone new, so maybe an intern.  You know be nice to them, they’re scared, they're new.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You need to teach them how to be a good doctor.  I mean don't be afraid to set them straight but you know.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And they are gonna be new okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Do you guys have any questions?
PATIENT: No that's okay.
DOCTOR: Okay great.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Alright so I'll put the orders in to the Lab.
