DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR, it's nice to meet you.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How you doing today?
PATIENT: Feel good uh but I see that my blood pressure is high.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's a little off huh.
PATIENT: I don't understand that.
DOCTOR: Well, so tell me what you’re on for blood pressure right now.
PATIENT: Say again.
DOCTOR: What medicine are you taking for blood pressure right now?
PATIENT: Well I was taking this metoprolol.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that's cause I was [REDACTED] in my heart.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Then they bumped it up for another 25, what do you call it?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh the milligrams so.
PATIENT: Okay milligrams the last time but.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: What I don't understand is this blood pressure business; see I don't shake a salt shaker.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I haven't did that in about 30 years.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So.
PATIENT: I know everything what you say, all processed food.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And frozen things.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause but I would say, I saw the dietician.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I got a little book so I could understand uh.
DOCTOR: Perfect.
PATIENT: My boneless, skinless chicken.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I [REDACTED] that might have had and I do frozen vegetables and stuff so I don't, I kind of monitor my sodium.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So this loses me how it's up like that.
DOCTOR: Well here's the thing, in some people there is, in most people it's a genetic one okay in that your parents have had it.  They might not have known that they had it or not but your family has it, their family has it so and as you age it just becomes a little bit harder to control.  Now the dose that you're on of the metoprolol.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is very little.  It's actually very, very, we can go up to 200 you know.
PATIENT: Well how much is it now?
DOCTOR: You're only at 50.
PATIENT: Well that's alright with me, the 50.
DOCTOR: I'm saying that there's a lot of room to go up and in a lot of people they have to use multiple medicines.  You're only on one so.
PATIENT: Well what is it; I don't understand why I got to use the medicine.  This is what's losing me.
DOCTOR: It's nothing to do with you.  People can exercise as much as they want, they can eat you know the best food that they can possibly get and have no fat, no salt, nothing.
PATIENT: Does it come with age?
DOCTOR: It can come with age and it can come with your family inheritance with your genetics okay.
PATIENT: Well okay if you look at here you can see how at mostly one time it was taken for my heart.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know my [REDACTED] ventricle lisinopril.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: but it was not agreeing with the allergies.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So then you could see what my blood pressure was then can't you?
DOCTOR: You can but [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And that's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah you can but the thing is that was also years ago right?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, years ago.
DOCTOR: And as you age it gets worse.
PATIENT: Oh yeah?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Them birthdays make some oh okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  As you age it gets worse.  It's nothing you're doing wrong.
PATIENT: But it's kind of scary, I tell you I mean like okay now what is this today, its 145 or something over 81.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Is that high blood pressure or is that the high end of normal?  I need the exact language.
DOCTOR: So it's high blood pressure okay cause for you, anybody who has blood pressure, your goal should be less than 130/80 okay.  So you're about 15 over which is not horrible but obviously could be better.
PATIENT: Okay now, now I ate breakfast and took my medicine at 1 o'clock so does that have anything to do with it?
DOCTOR: No cause the formulation you’re on is extended. I know you're fishing for it aren't you?  We're kind of like, what can I say?
PATIENT: I'm trying to.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: I'd like to know.
DOCTOR: You know I appreciate that you're, you know you're just trying to help yourself.  It's okay.  Don't worry about it.  Um it's just.
PATIENT: But my [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Just one day, gonna see in in the machine. I went and got me one of those blood pressure machine.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Did you see that?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well that day I fainted, now what does that mean?
DOCTOR: What do you mean you fainted, what happened?
PATIENT: I was cooking right and I take medicine oh shoot I got to the point where you know I couldn't stand up anymore so I told my son I said listen uh you go on and eat I'll get back to it later.
DOCTOR: Was it hot where you were cooking or what happened?
PATIENT: No it wasn't hot.  You know it's like the lights went out but I could feel it.  I was on my feet and all of a sudden then I went to the bed and I sat up and was talking and then I just keeled over okay, but maybe a second as I was coherent like I.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Could use some water or something you know, I get me some water.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And so we got me some water and then so I gets back up to continues.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then I know I had to lay back down cause I could see that I hadn't been down there long enough.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But so anyway then a day or so, [REDACTED] so then I came up here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then I saw the Emergency Room doctor and then they gave me uh a what's it called, a machine so I could do my own blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then I read to learn that I need to keep my feet and then sometime they do it over here, well I don't understand that you were told to do it over here.
DOCTOR: You can do it on this side.
PATIENT: Now all the information I got say you do it on this only.
DOCTOR: They want you to do it in one arm and stick to that one arm.
PATIENT: Yeah so they say.
DOCTOR: But you can take it on the other one, it's.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's alright.  Well let's just take a look at some of your old stuff real fast.
PATIENT: Well my old stuff was better than the current shoot, at least the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Yeah and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] was doctor what's his name DOCTOR or whatever.
DOCTOR: DOCTOR.
PATIENT: I think it was the doctor's name, it was borderline then and then for some reason I was able to work with it but then when DOCTOR became my doctor just, it got out of hand.  Sometime I come here and I haven't had my medicine that day but I had it today.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But you said next time that matter though huh?
DOCTOR: Not honestly that much. Um now my question for you is when you were having that dizziness did you have any pain in your chest at all?
PATIENT: Oh really no.  It's just [REDACTED] um I was kind of telling my son, I was explaining it to you uh.
DOCTOR: Were you dehydrated at all during that time.
PATIENT: Not dehydrated, but thirsty though.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it seemed like the room just, so what it was I hadn't eaten yet that day.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it was almost 4 p.m.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean that most likely is what did it.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: You know, just not having, cause what happens if you don't eat you don't have any nutrients in your body that can break down whatever you already have in just in the muscles.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And the liver and people, as we age, are not as good at accommodating to it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: I mean he thought it was an emergency and he said dial 911 and I said no it don't seem that serious.  I know I got to get the medicine and I got to.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like your heart was racing at that time?
PATIENT: No not at that time.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Not at that particular time but it has raced one time, just once only but not that time.
DOCTOR: When did it race?
PATIENT: Oh maybe between um about 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock one night.
DOCTOR: How long ago was this?
PATIENT: It was over a couple of years ago because I put, I explained it to my sister.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it was not last year.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Maybe in 2008 that happened.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And you know I was playing a computer game and it started and so I just stopped playing the game but I didn't know what might of made that.  It only happened one time though.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  Then it hasn't happened.
PATIENT: Yeah but.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But this fainting deal uh, I just.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: I mean, my legs felt strong but you know I just feel faint.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you felt like that at all since then?
PATIENT: No, not since then but seemed like around, I eat the same breakfast, I eat uh turkey, [REDACTED] and one substitute egg, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Egg whites and uh oatmeal so and uh fiber bread but I don't get an appetite for it, I don't necessarily like it but it's good for me so I wait until I get hungry and that be at least 11 or 12 o'clock so that's when I eat but that particular day I wasn't for the appetite and that's why I ended up eating at 4 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know what I mean but I try to between 11 and 12, to get something in me but that particular day it just happened to be 4 o'clock and when I could of [REDACTED] you know but I understand if you.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause I know what's healthy for me on the breakfast side to eat oatmeal every day so that's like a stress food and it's oats and grains and fiber.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I want it in me but you know I don't have the appetite for it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It's not very tasty is it.  Let me take a listen to you [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Lean forward; see if I can hear through this.  Take a big deep breath.
PATIENT: Well do you want [REDACTED] murmur?
DOCTOR: No it actually doesn't sound that bad.  Take a big deep breath and out again.  And again, last time, good.  Your lungs sound nice and clear.
PATIENT: They do?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh they actually sound good.  Alright well let me talk with my boss and I'll be right back.  The other question I have, did you ever smoke?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Do you still smoke?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Good for you.  Um did they ever check, there is one thing that we, it's more of a new recommendation that just kind of came out in that people who have ever smoked they should get what's called an ultrasound of your stomach uh.
PATIENT: For the aorta?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Was that, when was that a year ago or so?
DOCTOR: Uh it was a year and a half and it was normal so that's perfect so we do not have to get that.  Okay.
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me check in with my boss and I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  21:51  DOCTOR IN:  28:42)
DOCTOR: I got my boss with me.
DOCTOR: Hello.
PATIENT: Hello.
DOCTOR: How are you today?
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: Good. I’m DOCTOR, I wanted to introduce myself. DOCTOR went over your history and you're doing really well other than you had this isolated episode of where you felt a little bit like you might pass out or you did pass out.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um but you didn't end up on the floor so [REDACTED] felt that maybe you can.
PATIENT: Yeah I got feeling like you know I'd be better off in the bed.
DOCTOR: Okay and you had skipped a meal when that happened?
PATIENT: Yes, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Then that's probably what it is of course we're going to do a couple of things to make sure we’re not missing anything.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you haven't had [REDACTED] ever before.
PATIENT: Right and then after that I came in and seen the doctor and got a blood pressure machine and so that's what DOCTOR told me.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you know what it sound like, it sounds like it's not that bad but it could be a little better, your blood pressure so.  [REDACTED] I don't think [REDACTED] though.  Your dizziness, I don't think the blood pressure is why that happened.
PATIENT: Oh no.
DOCTOR: I don't think so.
PATIENT: Well I know it was about 4 p.m. and I had not fueled myself yet you know.
DOCTOR: That's the more likely thing than the blood pressure. Blood pressure you know we see a lot of headaches, sometimes ringing in your ears and you can get a little dizzy.
PATIENT: Well that headache, that happened about nine months or so ago, it's probably on record here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That’s when I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] I mean really it's probably – it’s just like one isolated event that happened right after you skipped a meal.  If it seemed obvious, that’s probably because it is but it's just you know we'll do some things that we probably, it's probably time to do anyway just to be on the safe side but I really wouldn't be concerned unless it happens again.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But I just wanted to make sure to introduce myself. It was nice to meet you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Take care.
PATIENT: Okay.  I had something in mind and it had slipped [REDACTED].  Okay go ahead, maybe it'll come to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we'll start with your blood pressure okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We are going to go up on that metoprolol okay.  Like I said you've got plenty of room so don't worry about it.  So we're going to go up from 50 to 75 okay.  It's a [REDACTED] increase, not too bad.  Alright.
PATIENT: Oh here's my question.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Okay you might see in there I'd had a problem at one time with that cholesterol right.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well I fixed that. Well, what helped me to fix that was to cut down on that egg and eat the egg whites and a whole lot more stuff and then another thing that helped me was apple cider vinegar.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: The apple cider vinegar could those throw my blood pressure off?
DOCTOR: Unlikely.  Unlikely.  I know you're trying.
PATIENT: Cause that's the thing.  It don’t have sodium, but it’s so bitter, right?
DOCTOR: It is but.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] water.
DOCTOR: Maybe.
PATIENT: I tell you what's going in that water.
DOCTOR: I'm not going to tell you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] something.
DOCTOR: I don't think so.  You know if you want to try it without it then we can.
PATIENT: Cause I got scared and I stopped taking it and then I learned there was no sodium in there cause I didn't know but I was drinking [REDACTED] there was no sodium and I could not [REDACTED] salt [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know but [REDACTED] itself that does that.  [REDACTED].  Alright so.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So that's the blood pressure issue.  Now the other.
PATIENT: How did I do that, now I got a pill and I cut it in half?  Is there another pill or something?
DOCTOR: Yeah, so what we're going is um, you can take the 50 until you get the new one in the mail okay.
PATIENT: Oh and then the new prescription.
DOCTOR: Then you'll get.
PATIENT: Will take the old one out.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and then as far as your dizziness, you're just going to have to [REDACTED].  Now as far as your dizziness is concerned, there's a couple things we want to check.  We want to check your labs again to make sure you're not like having anything like low potassium or low magnesium that could cause that dizziness okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That episode you had.  Okay so we'll do that. The other thing I want to do is you know where you had that ultrasound of your heart done a long time ago?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: So let's just check it again to make sure that nothing new is happening.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause that can also sometimes cause people to get dizzy okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I want you to come back and see me in a month okay.  So when you come in and see me in a month we'll see how you're doing with your blood pressure, we'll see how you're doing with that [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well I just go because you know if it's on the schedule cause you can do that 30 days.
DOCTOR: Yes you could do it right now before you leave actually.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And go get your labs done today and.
PATIENT: Well wait a minute, when I gonna get my labs done it means I shouldn’t have eat before I come.
DOCTOR: No it's okay, you don't have to worry about that.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No we have a new test that actually we can just measure directly in your blood.
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] so it's actually nice.
PATIENT: It is.
DOCTOR: Isn’t it?
PATIENT: After this, don't worry about eating and just come in I mean I used to fast sometimes you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And something like that.
DOCTOR: No that and give me a phone number to reach you at in case these tests.
PATIENT: NUMBER.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: NUMBER.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We're all set.  So go ahead and give this to them out front and they'll make you an appointment to come back and see me in a month.  Go get your labs done today and then we can schedule that echo, that ultrasound of your heart.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now do I go somewhere to get this echocardiogram, do I do that, go to this schedule.
DOCTOR: I think they can tell you up front.  You might have to go to the Heart Station, over there, but they'll point you the way.  I'm not sure cause I know sometimes they can schedule you for you here and sometimes they can’t.
PATIENT: Okay so how many things will I be doing before I leave?
DOCTOR: Schedule an appointment with me.  Get your labs and then schedule an appointment with the ultrasound, the echo.
PATIENT: Okay now that's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] not to worry.  Okay.
PATIENT: Okay then you'll take care of my prescription?
DOCTOR: Uh yes, your prescriptions are done [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I mean you know they'll be done in the mail in other words.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.
PATIENT: So what they do send me 150 and I cut that in half?
DOCTOR: I don't know what they do.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know they might be.
PATIENT: They like to do that half pill.
DOCTOR: Half pill I know.  I think it usually depends on um, I think it usually depends on what they have on stock you know.
PATIENT: Oh I was taking 25, they send me the 50 and half that so when they put in the 50 I just [REDACTED] 100 and cut it in that half.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] take it all.
DOCTOR: I don't know right.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] might have to get an increase on the phone huh, emergency now.
DOCTOR: Well maybe.
