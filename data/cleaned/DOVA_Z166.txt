DOCTOR: [REDACTED] is your liver cannot handle it anymore all those pain medications.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Right.
DOCTOR: Uh and you're only 47.
PATIENT: What the age got to do with it?
DOCTOR: I want you to be old and get old.  I don't want you to die young with your liver problems.
PATIENT: I know.  A lot of this stuff, my whole family is like this almost.
DOCTOR: So we got to find out something.  How to protect your liver and get you out of pain.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Right.  See my family's all been like this.  My granddaddy.

DOCTOR: Yeah I believe you, I believe you.
PATIENT: I got a cousin [REDACTED] they can’t turn their neck [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah but that doesn't mean that you have to be in pain but that doesn't mean we [REDACTED].
PATIENT: My joints is like deteriorating. I don’t know what’s wrong.  Like my arm, I can't move my arm. Messed up. That's just [REDACTED] limitation on my arm.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's tough and then my joints with the back and everything.  Now it's my hip, now my shoulder.
DOCTOR: Okay in your back.
PATIENT: It's in my back right.  My back's been hurting [REDACTED]. Something new, that’s my problem with that I say doc what's going on with my, what's really going on here?
DOCTOR: I hear you um.
PATIENT: Um well I know I’m in pain because you cut me down on my medication.  You what I'm saying you gonna cut back.  You know get off that TB stuff.  That's what's probably messing with my liver.  But ain't never had no problem with it until I started taking that.
DOCTOR: No, you don’t have problems with your liver.
PATIENT: For the kidney, whatever.  I wouldn't had no problem I would keep on my medications.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Until I started taking that what [REDACTED] she told me that it mixed with my [REDACTED] and stuff.
DOCTOR: That medication you're taking doesn’t affect the kidneys and we're monitoring your liver.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And your liver is doing okay so far.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you're not gonna take it for the rest of your life, it's only for nine months and you're almost half, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Hope, hope.
DOCTOR: So you have another four or five.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You're done after that.  You don't take that, so we [REDACTED] risk of tuberculosis.  Uh that's one thing.  The other thing is I, you're in pain.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And the medications [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] they will.
DOCTOR: Well I mean if, if I give five pounds of pain medication, of course you're gonna do it.
PATIENT: But it's alright.
DOCTOR: But that's not the answer because it kills all the other organs in your body but um I'm don’t remember, have you ever been seen in the Pain Clinic?
PATIENT: No, I tried to schedule a class with the Pain Clinic.
DOCTOR: A class?
PATIENT: Right yeah.  [REDACTED] I thought they had a class or something.
DOCTOR: No, no, no. I want you to see the doctor.
PATIENT: Yeah I haven't seen the doctor.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Sometimes they can.
PATIENT: Yeah I supposed to see Rheumatology next month.
DOCTOR: Okay.  That was the other question but let you go first to the Pain Clinic for anything.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Because sometimes, not in all the joints but the joints that hurt the most they can uh inject steroids that will take the pain away for months.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] too [REDACTED] I’m a diabetic and they didn’t want to. [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Who said that?
PATIENT: That's what I meant that I know.  I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Who?
PATIENT: Well since I been up here.
DOCTOR: Yeah but in which clinic?
PATIENT: Here.
DOCTOR: Here in General Medicine.
PATIENT: Right, right.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: The steroids would increase the sugars yes.  The problem is that we can deal with the sugars with medications as long as it takes care of the pain okay.  Now is this the first time you going to go to Rheumatology?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  [REDACTED] wouldn’t see me [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah I remember what [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right because you told me that I was drinking.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right, right but I was drinking and stuff.  And you say, well you better stop drinking [REDACTED].  So I stopped drinking and I started [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] I might drink something.
DOCTOR: You know what?
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] medication, just don’t.
PATIENT: Yeah I know, I know I try not to but you know.  I drink for years and you don't drink.
DOCTOR: I know.

DOCTOR: So.

PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They got some new kinds of medications for this type of pain.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It's not; it's medications that really have turned life around for a lot of people.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: What these medications do though, you cannot take them if you are at risk of tuberculosis.  One, well let me finish.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Once you are treated for tuberculosis then we can see that it's alright, now we can do this medication.
PATIENT: I [REDACTED] medicine a year from now.
DOCTOR: No, six months.
PATIENT: Yeah, that's a half of a year.
DOCTOR: Well, you’re only 47.  We got to do something in terms of [REDACTED] being in pain.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alcohol is not the answer.
PATIENT: No.  I don't know, maybe I can try [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I know that it is.  It is getting where it could.  The pain is like being temporary and [REDACTED] drink some more and after that, drink some more.
DOCTOR: Yeah you might be on [REDACTED] cause I was wondering [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I know but you know, hey I ain't [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I do, I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to tell you what we're trying to do here.
PATIENT: I understand what you're saying.
DOCTOR: I mean what our goal is that we're trying to do.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: My goal as your primary care doc is for you not to be in pain.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But for you to get the best care that we can possibly give you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Rheumatology doctors, as I said, are the joint specialists.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: With regard to the pain.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh have all these new kinds of fancy medications and injections as well that they can do injections um and that's all they do.  They don't deal with anything else.  They're great at what they do.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: They cannot give you that medication unless.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Exactly, exactly.  That's WWW.  I wish I could do something.
PATIENT: Okay.  Yeah well I just to be in pain.
DOCTOR: Well you've been in pain.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I meant more pain since the last month since the doctor took the medicine away.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] decreased it [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Decreased it right, right.  It is cutting it back, cutting it back some.
DOCTOR: You know people are in joint pain that they can live with that.  People cannot live without liver.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They cannot live without kidneys.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: They cannot live without heart or brain.
PATIENT: I thought that, what the problem is messing with my pills. The Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Hydrocordone and acetaminophen.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] right.
DOCTOR: While you are taking your pills.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Huh, no that's right.
DOCTOR: Brand name for Vicodin [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: The tuberculosis drug is isoniazid.
PATIENT: Yeah that don't mess with the liver?
DOCTOR: That in maybe 1 to 2% of the patients can mess with the liver and your liver so far has been doing fine.
PATIENT: But [REDACTED] with the drug.
DOCTOR: Yes.  [REDACTED] they can lower your vitamins and we are already giving you vitamins for that now.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So that's not an issue and your uh liver is doing okay.  [REDACTED] five days ago.
PATIENT: You got the kidneys, what about the kidneys?
DOCTOR: The [REDACTED] liver.
PATIENT: How are the kidneys doing?  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Your kidneys are hanging there, they're doing okay.  It's uh, it's doing okay.  It hasn’t changed.
PATIENT: What about the A1c?
DOCTOR: A1c is 6.0, excellent.

DOCTOR: Yeah colonoscopy?
PATIENT: I already had the colonoscopy.
DOCTOR: When was that?
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Let's see.

DOCTOR: Hmm let's see.
PATIENT: Around the first, I did that.
DOCTOR: Yeah we did a small bowel [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: Yeah you got [REDACTED] one okay.  Let's see.  Yeah that's it, you're right, it is the 5th.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Um cause I'm supposed to take that bowel thing.  I [REDACTED] but they told me not to take no more so I am getting [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But the first thing is [REDACTED] answer for the kidney because it can um.
PATIENT: Right that's what they and it's in my stomach.
DOCTOR: I understand it.  The Naproxen can damage your kidneys and your stomach.  Uh hydrocodone and acetaminophen that's what you take damages your liver uh and you take a lot.  If we came down to only one pill take care of all this joint pain can you imagine how much medications less you're going to take and how happy you're gonna be, so hang in there.  I mean you're halfway through.
PATIENT: So, [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Let me see.  You got those pills on the 6th, three weeks ago; you've got another week to wait regarding the refills you have left.  So you have enough, it's not a matter of me not ordering it, you have enough.  It's a matter of time really.  Uh let's see what [REDACTED].  Yet you are out of it?  Are you out of them completely uh the pain meds pill?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: The Naproxen I can give you some of that.
PATIENT: I think I called in for, called in I don't know to get a refill or what.
DOCTOR: For which one?
PATIENT: Naproxen.
DOCTOR: They filled it; they sent it on the 20th.  Let's see did they mail it.  They mailed it on the 20th so it should be, they mailed that.  They mailed the cream.
PATIENT: Okay yeah they mailed the cream.
DOCTOR: Okay so definitely that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The [REDACTED].  That was probably for the pain as well.
PATIENT: Yeah I use yeah that cream, well I been rubbing down on that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Like Ben-Gay.
DOCTOR: They mailed it.
PATIENT: I really some increase of that, a tube only lasts me a little week.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: That only last me a good week, right here, it [REDACTED] full.
DOCTOR: Let's do something.  I think we can [REDACTED] too, let's see.  They have [REDACTED] I think the same thing [REDACTED].  Uh Naproxen, trazodone.  Are you taking trazodone for sleep?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, it working out.  You know I'm on my tank now, I'm on uh CPAP.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh CPAP.
PATIENT: Yeah CPAP.
DOCTOR: The thing with the mask.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Did it help you?
PATIENT: Yeah I forgot to put some water in it, something like stuffing me up so I don't know whether I can do that anymore.  I took it off because I'm having stuffed it, cause the humidifier, I can't [REDACTED] with the humidifier.
DOCTOR: Oh [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um let's see [REDACTED].  Okay yeah um.  I'm looking at long term.  I'm looking how to get you better.  You’re a young man, if I can get your tuberculosis treated.
PATIENT: And my [REDACTED] look good.  [REDACTED] surgery [REDACTED].  It's just messed up, it just messed up with me, it just came in up again, like it hanging up.
DOCTOR: All your joints.  It's not one joint, if it was only one joint it's.
PATIENT: Right, right.  This one's like, that knee and if it swells up, that's my elbow right here.
DOCTOR: So what you need to do is just [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's what I did.
DOCTOR: That [REDACTED] fix all the joints, take the pain away from the joints.  So if I can treat your tuberculosis, if the Rheumatology doctors can help you find the perfect pill for you and when you take the pill from the rheumatologist will make the pain much better you'll be taking so much less medication, be more active.  By being more active you'll move more, hopefully lose some weight.
PATIENT: I'm losing weight, I lost some.
DOCTOR: Hold up. By losing more weight you won't need to use the mask don't you see?
PATIENT: That's what cause it?
DOCTOR: Yeah obesity.  That's the number one cause.  [REDACTED] So that's the number one cause.  So [REDACTED] what I'm saying is the answer to the problem is not add another pill, add another [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I'm trying to find the answer too [REDACTED], genetic-wise what I got that.  I knew what genetic wise.  [REDACTED] genetic wise but I didn’t think I’d be hurting like this.
DOCTOR: That's why, and the fact that there are a lot of people in your family have similar problems and it can be a genetic thing, something that's passed down.
PATIENT: Right that's what I'm saying.  I know [REDACTED] this.  If you know they could do a blood test like that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Uh most often no but yet let me see if Rheumatology has done any, just double check and then if not I can always.  Whether they have done it or not I can I'll do some blood work today or next time you come here.
PATIENT: Yeah I'll do it next week.  I'll be up next week and I'll get it.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll put it for Monday and come you can do it anytime next week.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh but do it before you see Rheumatology.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.  Yeah I'll seem the 15th.
DOCTOR: 15th.
PATIENT: 14th or 15th.  My cousin always had gout, uh what's that other thing that he gets.  Not gout [REDACTED].  But that [REDACTED] what it feels like.
DOCTOR: Yep, yeah um gout.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah we have gout that would give pain uh.  I would give you pain in some joints but not all over the body.  Um that's, so I'll put them for next Monday but um.
PATIENT: So even if they give me shots in my arms that still wasn't to give me that limitation I feel in them.  I'm really losing patience and motion.
DOCTOR: Motion, yeah.  We'll try to get some of it back.
PATIENT: They just seem like my joints like, I don't know what.  I'll see I'm, I know like [REDACTED] crushing down on [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right and that can [REDACTED].  You know what I'm saying; it'll give too much what they call it?
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: It’s just closing in on the spine.
DOCTOR: Right, right, right, stenosis.
PATIENT: Stenosis.  Narrowing.  Yeah.  I know [REDACTED] cause I had a doctor, DOCTOR checked, when he checked x-rays.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] the diabetes is doing much better.  Okay.

DOCTOR: [REDACTED] stop the glyburide. Because your diabetes is doing good so.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] yes.  I'm through with that glyburide.  That's what I noticed it, woo.
DOCTOR: It works good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] too good.
