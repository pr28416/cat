PATIENT: So you're the new doc?
DOCTOR: I am sir yes.
PATIENT: You're the new doc.
DOCTOR: We've rotated in.  We'll go around the corner.  Okay.  Alright have a seat.  I'm gonna close the door.  [REDACTED].  PATIENT how are things going?
PATIENT: Not as good as I would like.
DOCTOR: Not as good, okay.  What can we help with?
PATIENT: Uh. I just take [REDACTED]. Of where I've been the last couple of weeks.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] for you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I have my brief notes So on September 11, you had a kidney stone.  You went into an acute renal failure.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then you had the pulmonary edema and then back to the ICU and only just back into the real world.
PATIENT: And then I had uh two visits to the Emergency Room since then.
DOCTOR: Yeah with the bleeding.
PATIENT: The bleeding and the blood clots in my legs yeah.
DOCTOR: And then Urology saw you both times and basically you went to Urology they wanted to see you as soon as possible, uh October 5th okay.
SECOND PERSON H507
No I think
PATIENT: So that was cancelled.
SECOND PERSON H507
They told us to cancel it.
PATIENT: The last time I was in the Emergency Room.
DOCTOR: Oh they did [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The surgeons had put in the stint said there was no need cause that was basically Monday.
DOCTOR: Hmm, right.
PATIENT: Around Monday.  She said there was no need for me to come.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay so is it just mostly the GU issues, the Urology issues that are getting you down for the moment?
PATIENT: Right, both right.  I just.  She wants me to rest so I don't, to control the bleeding whatever you know and they also want me to exercise to build my strength back up again.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So it's like.
DOCTOR: Take one go to another one.
PATIENT: Take one go to another one.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  But you know anytime you get someone admitted for a prolonged stay at the hospital there's always some sort of deconditioning that goes with it you're in the hospital, you're not sleeping well; we're not exactly feeding you everything yeah.
PATIENT: You eat a little right yeah.
DOCTOR: And then you know you're also sick and you're fighting against an infection.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So that's the kind of thing.  So any sort of recovery after that is gonna take time.  Uh my question is besides the weakness at home how have you been?
PATIENT: I think I'm feeling good.
DOCTOR: Doing okay.
SECOND PERSON H507
He's doing better.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let's start with the urology issues, I mean how are you urinating right now?
PATIENT: I'm urinating fine uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: As of this morning my urine was [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh that's [REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: Oh that is.
PATIENT: Because the bleeding that came out, it was at the time, I really didn't exert myself.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know, if I can get the stents out the sooner the better I think would be but from I understand it, the scheduling issues with the urologist.
DOCTOR: They're a busy service, Urology.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But no blood in the urine right now.
PATIENT: Right, well as of this morning that's it no.
DOCTOR: Uh any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: No pain.
DOCTOR: Now are you going to the bathroom more often, less often or about as normally as you usually do?
PATIENT: I would say probably more often.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So are you drinking more water you think?
PATIENT: I'm drinking fluids right yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Did they tell you to increase your fluids?
SECOND PERSON H507
No they put a restriction on his fluids when he was in the hospital.
PATIENT: I was on fluid restriction when I was in the hospital.
SECOND PERSON H507
[REDACTED] I think.
DOCTOR: Your kidneys weren’t really working.
PATIENT: Right.
SECOND PERSON H507
Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But this last time uh in the Emergency Room, you know it was like.
DOCTOR: Oh go back to regular [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Not too much, not too little.  Okay.  Now any fevers or chills?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any pain along the back?
PATIENT: I'm still taking the Cipro for another.
SECOND PERSON H507
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: I think the end of the week, I think that's.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON H507
That's right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fevers, chills.  Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Are you eating everything okay at home?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Your appetite's fine?
PATIENT: Appetite’s good.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Sleeping okay at night?
PATIENT: Uh not really.  I sleep like from yeah maybe 2 hours, 2 1/2 hours tops.
DOCTOR: What happens um?
PATIENT: Well I wake up.  Sometimes I wake you know have to go and urinate you know and then I come.
(Someone knocks on the door)
DOCTOR: Okay sleeping 2-3 hours at a time and then waking up.  Is there anything in particular that you feel is waking you up.  I mean are you in pain?
PATIENT: No just can't sleep.
DOCTOR: Anything bothering you?  No.
SECOND PERSON H507
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: I have, prior to all this situation; I had you know I guess you'd call it restless leg syndrome, leg pain, once or twice a month.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't if there's a...
DOCTOR: Have you ever had in the past have you had a sleep study done to check for sleep apnea?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  Okay.  Ah, let me ask you a few questions in that aspect, I mean have you ever been told that you snore, snore excessively?
SECOND PERSON H507
He's never snored, no.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] and then in the morning when you do sleep, and you wake up do you feel pretty refreshed or do you still feel pretty tired when you wake up?
PATIENT: Well normally I feel refreshed but with all this that's going on I don't feel like and when I wake up I'm not.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So this is new, this whole waking up [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's, no, [REDACTED] like you know it's not like I'm [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay then [REDACTED] don’t have any energy.
SECOND PERSON H507
But most of the time since the hospital.
PATIENT: Right since the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So.
PATIENT: And even if I take you know like a nap you know during the day and all that, I'm not, ready to bounce out of bed.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like you fall asleep pretty easily during the day?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So if we kind of left you alone in this room for ten minutes do you think you'd dose off?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: But maybe even [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  So this is the most important question I guess, has anyone ever expressed to you that you stop breathing at night while you're sleeping, any problem with that?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright so.  Uh something you can consider but there's really not a lot of clinical issues to support doing a sleep study right now.  One of the things that can cause restless leg is people who have sleep apnea, people who have these sort of events overnight when they stop breathing.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But right now I think the thing that’s going to build your strength and everything back up after the hospitalization.  Let me go through your most recent blood work and see if there's anything that really stands out to me.  I know they check your urine a lot and basically every time it was [REDACTED] as far as your last blood test and you've had a lot of them actually.
PATIENT: Yes they do.
DOCTOR: Especially being in the hospital.
PATIENT: If I have any blood left.
DOCTOR: So I mean that's fine.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I have a history of low platelets.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED].  Um okay.  So that's from the hospital point of view.  Uh how far are you able to walk right now before you have any problems?
PATIENT: Probably to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Is the wheelchair new since being discharged or is it something you?
PATIENT: No I knew that I couldn't walk from valet you know all the way over here.  I knew I couldn't walk that far.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But then before you had this most recent hospitalization were you able to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.  Oh yeah.
SECOND PERSON H507
Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay you were walking then.
PATIENT: Yeah, no that's good.
SECOND PERSON H507
Probably because he's kind of weak.  That’s all it is.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Now have you started uh have you done any form of physical therapy or rehabilitation since discharge?
SECOND PERSON H507
Well they told him to walk.
PATIENT: No they just told me to.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just do walking but I didn't need any you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H507
But then when the bleeding started she said to stop walking.
PATIENT: To stop walking.
SECOND PERSON H507
So you know he was not.
PATIENT: Like it's a Catch 22 you know.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: That's kind of what I'm saying today you know life says stop with the blood now I'm like you know this afternoon it might start back up again, just a little bit of.
DOCTOR: With a little bit of exertion?
SECOND PERSON H507
Right.
PATIENT: The walking that I've done and it really isn't exerting.  I mean it's not like I'm lifting something or anything like that.
DOCTOR: I think a couple of things to keep in mind, first of all it only takes a little bit of blood to discolor the whole urine.  The other thing is you know whatever caused this bleeding, you’ve got a stent in.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what they did yeah.
DOCTOR: Um right and that's always gonna be there and that's gonna cause irritation that kind of thing until they take it out.
PATIENT: Uh-huh right.
DOCTOR: And then whatever was bleeding tends to clot and if those clots, sometimes they could dislodged.  It's more common with stents, it's more common in the bladder but um anyway you know because you do have bleeding kind of like that.  As long as it's not, you know if it's pink pink urine.
PATIENT: This is like cranberry juice.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean it started dark.
DOCTOR: That's dark.
PATIENT: It's darker yeah.  It's darker yeah, it's not.
SECOND PERSON H507
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright so I mean Urology has seen you just recently and they're the experts in that.  That's not my area of expertise.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: I'll let them manage that.  Uh let's focus on some of your other sort of more medical problems which uh hypertension.  So today in clinic blood pressure not doing so bad 130/60, so I'm happy with that.  Uh your pulse was a little fast so I'll recheck that in just a minute.
PATIENT: It's normally; my normal pulse is between 90 and 100.
DOCTOR: 90 and 100 okay.  So I think it's over 100, we just want to make sure.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So yours was 104, so I'll just double check it.
PATIENT: Oh in a minute yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay just so fair warning, you're right-handed.
PATIENT: Cause everybody when I come here everybody says you know are you nervous about being here and I go no, no that's normal for me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I don't notice that it's.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know that it's fast.
DOCTOR: And you're not having any palpitations?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Chest pain, anxiety, no okay.  So then the other thing is the hyperlipidemia.  So the last time you had your cholesterol checked, it was actually very recently I think September 17th which was a couple of weeks ago.
PATIENT: When I was in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it seemed that they checked it in the hospital, it's usually not a hospital test that they usually do [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON H507
They tested him for everything.
PATIENT: Yeah everything.
DOCTOR: Figured while you were there why not right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So uh the bad cholesterol is fine, it's well controlled actually and then your triglycerides look fine.  The good cholesterol was a little bit low but I'm not going to chase that number right now, since  you’ve gone through that whole ordeal so I'll wait at this time.  I refilled your medications so do you need any of those?
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: And then the Lantus, the test strips, and they ordered a Coude catheter I don't know why they did that.
SECOND PERSON H507
[REDACTED]
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON H507
You never know.
DOCTOR: Yeah let me, let me, let me discontinue that.
PATIENT: That was ill-advised.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  That's supposed to be a one way street you know.  It was really supposed to come out then.
SECOND PERSON H507
Exactly.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  DOCTOR said when I saw him, he never should have.
SECOND PERSON H507
Ever.
PATIENT: With my history of low platelets.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And all that he says it never should've [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON H507
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Been put on that to begin with.
DOCTOR: And then the statin I refilled.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh the metformin I also reordered and the Losartan I reordered.  The finasteride for the prostate I also reordered.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then the Cipro they gave you enough for to finish the treatment so I don't think you have to worry about that and now was there anything else?
PATIENT: The only post treatment, that there's any question about it is the I have [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Tamsulosin?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Um.
SECOND PERSON H507
Is that the [REDACTED] medicine?  It thins the blood?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No BP or BPH.
SECOND PERSON H507
Blood pressure, blood pressure.
PATIENT: Blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: I get like a dry cough.
DOCTOR: Okay so uh Losartan.
PATIENT: I've heard that some blood pressure medicines.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Can cause that sort of thing.  So it's not a constant thing but I.
DOCTOR: The ones that most commonly cause it are called ACE inhibitors and uh those are medications like lisinopril or Captopril.  They all have a pril ending.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: And then what happens is after that we got a new generation of medicines that kind of work in a similar fashion but they don't have that side effect and those are something called ARP and that's a medication like Losartan.
SECOND PERSON H507
And that's what he's on.
DOCTOR: Yeah so we just need to get it down.  Losartan does not cause that.
SECOND PERSON H507
Okay.  Okay, probably something else.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I have a question about the medications.  Is there any way that I'm assuming that you probably just reordered the [REDACTED] just has been in the past.  Is there any way to increase the metformin and the simvastatin so I’m not reordering that?
DOCTOR: Yeah I think what I did was I have to put everything in for 90 days.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  Because yeah it's something I'm gonna be on.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And having to reorder you know.
SECOND PERSON H507
Constantly.
PATIENT: Constantly every month uh.
DOCTOR: So I'm just looking through it, I'm making sure that I think that's yeah, that's what I did for every.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I think that's the most that the VA will actually let me do.
SECOND PERSON H507
That's much better than 30 days’ worth.  So.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So 90 days and then three refills is as many as they'll let me fill.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H507
Per year?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H507
Sure.
PATIENT: I get it.  And the simvastatin is the only one [REDACTED] reordered it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: He probably said you need to fill it.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So all that's taken care of.
PATIENT: That's all good.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON H507
So now does he have to reorder it or they're all gonna be ordered so you just put in the prescriptions but they're not [REDACTED].
PATIENT: They're there yeah.
DOCTOR: So I put in the prescription and just like before.  So you'll call the VA.
PATIENT: So we will just continue right.
DOCTOR: And then next time they'll send you 90 days’ worth.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: With three refills.
PATIENT: Okay.  The only other thing I got is and I don’t think you can do this is helping moving up the.
DOCTOR: Oh the stent, have the stent removed?
PATIENT: Stent removal.
DOCTOR: Oh.  [REDACTED].
(Someone comes to the door and the doctor visits with them)
PATIENT: Leave from here yeah.
DOCTOR: Anyway.
SECOND PERSON H507
No the issue with the bleeding is that we feel that you know they have him bleeding intermittently for the next six weeks.
PATIENT: For six more weeks.
SECOND PERSON H507
Sounds like an awfully long time and the cause of it could be gotten out of there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H507
You know what you know who wants to have bled for six weeks?  Cause this seems like so long.  And they said it was a scheduling issue you know well, the body can handle it.
DOCTOR: Well no I understand, I feel the same way and to be honest I mean there's not a lot I can do from my end.
SECOND PERSON H507
I know, we understand.
DOCTOR: They don't let me go in there and take the stents out ourselves, that's the problem.
PATIENT: No I know.
SECOND PERSON H507
But we were hoping you could put a word in or something.
PATIENT: She did say, the surgeon she did say what was it Monday at noon [REDACTED] she was going to try to do something to move it up I don't know.  But uh you know, six weeks of watching every time that I you know I mean it's all there.  Sometimes you know just wait like I'm saying I might go home today now and sometimes the little bit of walking that I'm doing might enough.
SECOND PERSON H507
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] prostate yeah but.
SECOND PERSON H507
And can you get a flu shot too?
PATIENT: Oh yeah the flu shot and the pneumonia shot.  The nurse wanted to give it but I wanted to talk to you first.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because being on.
DOCTOR: The antibiotics you're on.
PATIENT: Antibiotic and all that.
SECOND PERSON H507
He just had a staph infection.
PATIENT: Should I hold off on it or take it now?
DOCTOR: You can come back in a week and just come back and tell them that you need to get the shots, come down again.  Cause you'll be done with your antibiotics by them.
PATIENT: But wait, so wait until I am off?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah and it's not you know really there's no I mean we could do it today but I'm just gonna be more of a cautious guy than [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's what I thought cause you know that maybe it was yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Because again you're not having any symptoms and it looks like the antibiotics are doing their jobs.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Give it a while.  I mean if it's convenient for you to come back in a week but by all means.
PATIENT: Well I got to come back in.
SECOND PERSON H507
I think while he was in the hospital he had a staph infection and then you know oh you'll go home with antibiotics but he kept being allergic to everything.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON H507
So they introduced another thing now, it's kind of scary.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah so we'll.
SECOND PERSON H507
But that's what they wanted to do [REDACTED] flu.
PATIENT: Right.  Well why don't you set it up, cause I'm coming back for.
DOCTOR: Actually, you know what, you know what I'll do is I'll ask DOCTOR my senior physician and I'm pretty sure that the flu would be okay to get it today and then the pneumovac -  I'm gonna see if you can wait or not wait.  I personally don't have a strong preference but I'll see if my attending physician has a strong preference for now okay.
SECOND PERSON H507
Cause he did have the flu lungs it's just kind of scary though but whatever you think is right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The last time they checked your blood sugar level, that hemoglobin A1c which tells us how well your sugars has been controlled for three months um it was very [REDACTED].  Your number was like perfect.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON H507
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: 5.7 I mean like it's amazing.  I think it affects.
PATIENT: No I haven't, I haven't been taking my metformin.
DOCTOR: Right cause you had the renal failure.
PATIENT: And because and the Cipro the pharmacist said not to take it while I'm on Cipro.
DOCTOR: Now when you're checking your blood sugars at home how have they been?
PATIENT: 120, 140.
DOCTOR: 140 okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I think I'm really border, I'm borderline yeah.
DOCTOR: Borderline diabetic.
SECOND PERSON H507
Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So again uh it's okay if the sugars are, you know like if we don't control them so tightly as long as they're below 200, 250 I'm fine.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Like a small window.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So the diabetes is fine.
PATIENT: I think we got that controlled pretty good.
DOCTOR: Okay and then Urology is following you so that's fine.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So why don't you go ahead and have a seat up here.  Go ahead and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any swelling in your legs?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I mean walking [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] It's an overall [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON H507
Exhausted.
PATIENT: Exhausted, yeah. And it's not like exhausted just cause I can't do anything else it's just that I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Now have you been getting better since your discharge, since you left the hospital like every day are you making some progress?
SECOND PERSON H507
I think so until the set back.
PATIENT: Then I start [REDACTED] down.
SECOND PERSON H507
Well I think he went backwards on that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON H507
But before that, for ten days before that that he felt like [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh yeah, oh yeah I was definitely improved from when I was discharged yeah.
SECOND PERSON H507
With all that again and.
DOCTOR: Okay. Cause I was making sure that you weren’t losing too much blood. It doesn't look like that’s the case, they checked just a couple days ago.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And so.
DOCTOR: Let's take a look.
SECOND PERSON H507
Yeah he's got color back.  You were pasty for a while.  You look much better you know look at you, you look like you’re healthier now.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath and again, deep breath and again.  [REDACTED].  Nice deep breath with your mouth open and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out.  Alright.  Now before when someone's listened to your heart have they ever told you that they hear a murmur or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H507
Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay so that's not new.  That's something that's been there for years?  Okay.  Chin up for me. Can you lean forward?  Take a deep breath and out, okay.
PATIENT: When I was in the hospital they said I needed to get an echocardiogram.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: To see if the valve leaks.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Did you ever do one of the neck. Just curious.
PATIENT: I don’t remember.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] The reason is that the heart murmur that you have, in some people what it can do is it can travel up the neck which is fine but I'm not concerned about it.  If I hear a murmur that's just in the neck then that's something I'd want to investigate.
PATIENT: Hmm.  I don't think they did.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well here's the thing, when I marked [REDACTED] the heart, marking it up.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: This [REDACTED].  Deep breath in and again.  [REDACTED] Carotid [REDACTED] good seal over there.  Okay.  Any problems with dizziness, lightheadedness?  No nothing like that.  Any chest pains.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  Trouble breathing when you're lying flat at night?
PATIENT: Uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But you can do it?
PATIENT: I can do it [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.  I was laying on my side again.
DOCTOR: Okay so [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Can you remove your glasses for me?  I want to take a look into your eyes.  Stare at my nose.  Okay.  [REDACTED].  Alright.  I'm gonna go ahead and pull your eyelids down for me, I just want to take a look.  Alright.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Just um [REDACTED] dark irises.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: A very unique coloration.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Over okay.  Then another thing is [REDACTED] um the reason why we [REDACTED], the reason why we'd be interested in looking at the eyes is you when we pull your eyelids down, you know there are a lot of blood vessels [REDACTED] white [REDACTED] then that’s when I’d be concerned.
SECOND PERSON H507
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Mine are okay?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Your’s are okay [REDACTED].  And if your blood pressure was high as well.  [REDACTED].  Now things that would tell me you know if you [REDACTED]things I would be concerned for anemia you know you're having shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, that kind of thing, so if that starts to happen, that's when you come into the Emergency Department and call me and should probably check your hemoglobin level and make sure everything's okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But.
PATIENT: Oh she also told me that she that she wasn’t too concerned about the clots as long as I was passing it.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Yeah.  She said if I wanted to you know, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You can't urinate.
PATIENT: You can't urinate and then get back in right away.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] there you go.  [REDACTED] yeah she got it covered.  Alright so what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna go outside and talk to DOCTOR and double check about the Pneumovax vaccine and the flu um there's really not much else that we need to address today.  Blood pressure looks like it’s doing okay.  Lipids are fine.  The diabetes is a well under control so it's okay to hold the metformin for now and then.
SECOND PERSON H507
He [REDACTED] after the Cipro?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Give me a second [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON H507
Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright so I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I have a feeling when I come back I'm gonna schedule this here. [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON H507
Oh no [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: 71:45  DOCTOR IN:  79:50
DOCTOR: Alright.  Okay so actually um like I said earlier, I was sitting on the fence with the Pneumovax.  The only contraindication would be if you actually had signs of an active infection.  Uh in patients actually so what happens patients come, they're at risk for pneumonia and if they have in an infection we treat them for pneumonia and then before they get discharged um we can give them the vaccine so it's very safe.  So yes today for influenza and yes to the pneumonia vaccine today.
SECOND PERSON H507
Alright.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So then I told the nurse and they're gonna start setting that up for you so when you're getting ready to leave you should be ready to go.
SECOND PERSON H507
Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh any other questions for me?  I think that uh so things are going really well right now um.  Mostly your health problems are very well controlled.  It's just you had this stone and then all these complications that came as a result.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So Urology is really [REDACTED] point on that.  Now if you've had any problems you're always welcome to come back and see me um but if everything stays the course I think a year would be fine to come back.
SECOND PERSON H507
Oh sure.
PATIENT: Are you gonna be here in a year?
DOCTOR: Oh I'll be here for at least three years.
PATIENT: Oh really.
SECOND PERSON H507
Oh that's good.
DOCTOR: Yeah so.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
SECOND PERSON H507
Oh good.
DOCTOR: And then um.
PATIENT: Good.
SECOND PERSON H507
That'd be perfect.
