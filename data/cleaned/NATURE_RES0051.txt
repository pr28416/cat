PATIENT: My father.
DOCTOR: OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask today, was there anything else you wanted to tell me?
PATIENT: No, that's it. What do you think I have?
DOCTOR: Well, it is sounding like it could be most likely an infectious type of process going on with the possibility of having a fever with a cough and sore throat. So we'll do a physical exam and also some investigations which will include a covid test today. Because some of these symptoms do overlap, but it could be something like the common cold. I don't know the virus that's bringing this on but it's not necessarily covid. But because we're doing the test, it will require 14 days of self isolation. We'll get back to you with the results as quickly as we can.
PATIENT: OK, sounds great, thank you.
