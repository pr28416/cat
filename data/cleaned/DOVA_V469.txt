DOCTOR: Hi PATIENT.
PATIENT: How you doing?
DOCTOR: Oh thank you.  Right here.  A lot has happened to you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR and I'll be seeing you today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Nice to meet you.
PATIENT: So you're gonna be my new doctor?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yes.
PATIENT: Okay cause the last time I was here.
DOCTOR: It was a while ago right?
PATIENT: Yeah well I had come in on an emergency cause what the doc said it was a heart attack.
DOCTOR: You had a heart attack.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Yeah so last time you were here you had a heart attack in August.
PATIENT: Right.  So before that I didn't know that my regular doctor wasn't here anymore.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I been trying to get here but for some reason I've been missing my appointments in a while.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED] come up for you?
PATIENT: Man I missed about three, four appointments.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Oh what happened with?
PATIENT: Well I don't know I guess with me, to see a doctor I about have to have, there better be a need you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's got to be something that, you know, first of all I have to go see someone.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I kind of put everything else as part of me [REDACTED] cause I'm not you know.  Like I was telling the nurse I was having problems with taking the medications I was given after my heart attack where I'd be getting headaches.
DOCTOR: Which one?
PATIENT: All of them, I guess all of them.
DOCTOR: All of them.
PATIENT: I guess so, I was on four.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And after I would take it you know maybe at night, maybe about an hour or so later I'd be having a headache.
DOCTOR: There's one called Plavix.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That one is more important than anything else cause that, I can explain to you, you know the stent that you have in the heart.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: If you don't take that it doesn't keep your blood thin and it can clog up again which means you can have another heart attack.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So that one you need to take every day and I guarantee it's not the one causing headaches.  There’s been no [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It was kind of getting to the point where I didn't want to take any of them because I didn't know which one; you know I might take them if I could find out.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So how long have you not taken any of your medications?
PATIENT: Oh actually it's been about two, three weeks now.
DOCTOR: None of them, not even one of them?
PATIENT: No, like I said uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The headaches like migraines and [REDACTED] instantly you know when I would cough.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: And so I didn't know which one so I didn't take any of them.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I kept making appointments and missing them you know and stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Can you describe the headaches or was it a migraine?
PATIENT: It was like a migraine.
DOCTOR: Can you tolerate light?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Is it worse when you look into the light?
PATIENT: Yes I think it was uh.  It would be instantly, thought [REDACTED].  I figured it can't be all of the medications that was doing it but I didn't know which one.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well this is what we can do.
PATIENT: Cause I just wouldn't take it you know.
DOCTOR: We can restart your medications but try them like two at a time.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So the Plavix, like I said, that is definitely not one that causes headaches.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: There's no way that that would be causing your headaches.  So let's restart that one because that's the most dangerous to be off of.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Very dangerous [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well it's surprising to me that I had even had a heart attack you know and I know I had high blood pressure for a while.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay you had chest pain and everything too right?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause it was surprising to him when I came in and the doctor said that uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's what it was you know so.
DOCTOR: So there's many things that could predispose you to heart attacks.  One of them is having high cholesterol, which you do have.
PATIENT: Yes I do right.
DOCTOR: And another thing high blood pressure which you do have.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: One of them is smoking, do you smoke?
PATIENT: Well I have started back.  I had just about stopped and I started back somewhat and not as much as I was, but.
DOCTOR: How much do you smoke now?
PATIENT: Now I might smoke maybe a half a pack will last me about 2-3 days.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No only on occasions.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Probably celebrations, something like that but that's it.  But also um like I told my last doctor I had here's the paperwork that I need redone.
DOCTOR: For?
PATIENT: Uh for my disability.
DOCTOR: What are you on disability for?
PATIENT: Uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So which one needs to be filled out?
PATIENT: If you could fill out the renewal [REDACTED].  It has to be renewed [REDACTED] on the car.
DOCTOR: Oh, you can't walk?
PATIENT: Well I can only walk so far.
DOCTOR: Okay how far can you walk?
PATIENT: Then my legs kind of give out on me.  [REDACTED] it was a blockage [REDACTED] blockage.  See in the emergency the doctors that treated me at the time had taken out [REDACTED] go through my new doctor you know.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: You know so if you could do it now [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: This is all fine but you need to take the medications.  I don't know how much to stress to you.
PATIENT: Yeah, I can go.
DOCTOR: How important this is, you could die easily.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You know how important it is to take this Plavix when you have a stent in your heart.
PATIENT: Okay.  And I was wondering too about the aspirin that was given to me the first time when I came too.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And when I tried to get it renewed they said I had to come back to the doctor to renew it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I'll renew all your medications.
PATIENT: Just for the aspirin, like I say aspirin was the lowest thing on the totem pole and I got to wait and come back to the doctor for aspirin.
DOCTOR: Well the only reason why is because these dose that they have you on.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: They wanted you to take this dose for only one month and then they wanted you to come to me here. Which you didn’t do.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And I'm supposed to put you on a lower dose cause you're only supposed to be on a high dose for one month after the heart attack.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: That's why it was started.
PATIENT: And then the nurse was telling me something about that um like on the commercial where they have, they're talking about the blood pressure and uh some kind of cough syrup that you can take.
DOCTOR: A what?
PATIENT: Some type of cough syrup that you could take.
DOCTOR: I'm not sure.
PATIENT: No to override the headaches.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It had something to do with uh the headaches.  I don't know.
DOCTOR: A cough syrup for headaches?
PATIENT: Yeah it was a cough syrup.  I couldn't understand it either.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I couldn't understand it really cause before when I was taking the blood pressure pills I hadn't had headaches like that you know when I would take them you know.
DOCTOR: Do you want it mailed to you or pick it up at the windows?
PATIENT: You know I could stop and pick it up at the window.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Aspirin.
DOCTOR: Today, uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah.  And also because you know I had surgery for my prostate you know, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: And maybe, well I wanted to ask about uh [REDACTED] the pump.
DOCTOR: To do what?
PATIENT: I wanted to ask about a prescription for the pump.
DOCTOR: The pump?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh we can get you a return visit with them.
PATIENT: Because see I was taking the pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But then I stopped taking the pills.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it seemed like the situation got a little worse after I had the surgery.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So it was recommended [REDACTED] maybe I could start a pump.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well I'll have you follow up with the GU doctors so they can tell you; you know what to do to go about in getting it.  I know we don't have it here.
PATIENT: I thought they did cause they uh.
DOCTOR: Well, you can check with um.
PATIENT: Yeah cause the last time I was here they was talking about it at the Pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Did they have the pump?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well I'll check for you, for sure.  Other things your blood pressure is way too high.
PATIENT: Maybe that's because I haven't took none of my medications in a minute.
DOCTOR: 179/98.  So why don't we do this um why don't we start you back on two of your - your Plavix.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And one of your blood pressure medications and see if you can tolerate that.  If you can tolerate that we'll start back your cholesterol medications too and see if you can tolerate that.
PATIENT: Well that's just about the only one that I was somewhat taking was for my cholesterol.  I was kind of taking that to see now I'd stopped all my blood pressure pills you know.
DOCTOR: So what [REDACTED] medications [REDACTED] for you?
PATIENT: Well actually uh there's [REDACTED] something else, I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: The metoprolol.
PATIENT: It's just because the last doctor that I had.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He had changed them to suppertime for me because it was the affects that I was getting but still I actually found out it wasn't actually the pills, it was my prostate that was uh.
DOCTOR: It looks like yeah you were on the metoprolol but at a low dose and Captopril.  When you were on metoprolol before did you have headaches then?
PATIENT: No.  All this happened just after I had had the heart attack.
DOCTOR: Well we can try to decrease the dose of metoprolol.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And see if that helps.  Right now you're on 200, every day, I'd say you can cut that in half and see if that helps.
PATIENT: Because it was really scary.  What's bothering me right now is I ain't got the energy for it, I would cough.  I would cough maybe once and instantly I’d get this headache, you know.  Cause man what is this you know and so I would you know the next day and I would take it and I would cough.  Just a little simple cough you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I'd say hey, it could be something else cause I haven't taken the blood pressure pills for quite a while.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then [REDACTED] it was the quantity that I was taking, you know.
DOCTOR: Maybe cutting them in half might help.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You can try that and the Plavix.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And the cholesterol medication too so you can at least start with those three and then you can start that fourth blood pressure medication if you're tolerating.
PATIENT: Uh-huh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And the aspirin you did not take you said.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do you want to pick it up?
PATIENT: Well see I was dealing with the aspirins uh even before the heart attack.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I just didn't take them on a regular basis like I was doing the aspirin, you know and it thins the blood so much you know.
DOCTOR: Right. [REDACTED].  You had your cholesterol checked in August and at that time it was still high so I want to recheck it actually, it's been a while since you've – I’m sure it’s going [REDACTED]  Uh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I understand okay.
DOCTOR: Do you cholesterol on and off.
PATIENT: Now there's one thing that I discussed with DOCTOR you know I have this problem a lot of times with making my appointments [REDACTED] and I don't seem to want to jump in fully [REDACTED] problem, like it is now, with me not taking the medications because of the headaches, you know.
DOCTOR: What are the reasons that you don't want to come?  You don't feel bad or is it [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well no, there's always just something that pops up during that period of time, you know, that I need to do.
DOCTOR: What would make it easier for you to come?
PATIENT: Well now, you know since I have this problem with the headaches and I can't just not take them is I just need to come and find out what the problem is.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED] what's going on.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know with the high cholesterol, [REDACTED] with it, heart attack with a stent and you don't feel it.
PATIENT: But that's really surprising because of the fact that I went so long with the high blood pressure if you noticed on my record, it's been a while and.
DOCTOR: And that's probably what made you, you know have the heart attack that and the smoking obviously.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah because at first I thought it was gas.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  It just felt like it was moving, like I was telling my wife you know, oh it’s just gas you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She said I don't know, you need to try to get that checked out you know so it continued throughout the day off and on you know.  So that's when I stopped [REDACTED] find out exactly what it is you know and then I was surprised when the doctor told me that uh you know I might have missed one you know so.
DOCTOR: If there's one thing that I want you to promise me is that you will take your Plavix.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Medication, your aspirin and at least one of your blood pressure medications and your cholesterol medication. That’s it.  Those are the one thing that I want you to.
PATIENT: Because I was doing all that when I first got home from the hospital you know I was taking them all every day and the first time I was [REDACTED] but what set me back when I started getting the headaches you know.
DOCTOR: The headaches might not have been related [REDACTED].
PATIENT: We'll see it was something that would happen, it didn't happen before.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I was given the medications and then when I got out the hospital and I started taking the new medications it started.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know it just started that way and I guess it had to wait until my blood changed or whatever [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] I wouldn’t [REDACTED] medications.
PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: So now you're gonna be thinking it was the medications and you're not gonna want to take it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But we don't know for sure that's what it is.
PATIENT: Because you know when you, you know you think about the situation and think about what you have done before and what you have taken before and you didn't have this problem.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know so you start having this problem, you said it has to be some that's related to the medication.
DOCTOR: But you were on that medication before, the metoprolol.
PATIENT: Uh not all the medications I was on, that I'm on now.
DOCTOR: No, not all of them, but you were on cholesterol pills which is in the same family as the lisinopril.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So they were in the same family and you were on metoprolol which is the same medication, just a higher does so we'll decrease it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If that helps and the cholesterol medication seems like you're tolerating it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And the Plavix does not cause headaches, I’m telling you.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: In my medical [REDACTED] Plavix.
PATIENT: Okay it won't.
DOCTOR: I really, really encourage you.
PATIENT: You, try to find out exactly what it was, so it wasn't something that was happening, I have to do something, I'm doing now so maybe [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So something I came to the conclusion that it has to be the medication.
DOCTOR: Why don't we try it again on a lower dose then.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and then just start with the metoprolol at 150 mg, [REDACTED] the aspirin, the Plavix and um the cholesterol medication the simvastatin okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just those, that’s it, those four.
PATIENT: Because it's something about uh the situation just like when I was having the prostate problem, I tolerate the situation for a while.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Until it gets to the place where I can't tolerate it anymore and that's when I get up off of my tail and go get it evaluated and checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And with this here, I couldn't bear with constantly having these headaches.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know throughout the day you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  75:11  DOCTOR IN:  80:51)
DOCTOR: Okay so I printed a copy out [REDACTED] about the pump okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then the medications that I want you to take, take this with you okay.  This one, which is for the blood thinner for the stent, this is important okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It is important. And then this one you can wait on.  This one I decreased to 100 only so that's probably will help the headaches okay and you can pick that up or you can just cut the pill you have at home in half.  Actually no, you can pick that up at the window and then this one wasn’t causing any problem so you can go ahead and take that, it's the cholesterol one.
PATIENT: Cholesterol one.
DOCTOR: And then the aspirin.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] take this medication and see how it works but until I can do uh, [REDACTED] the pump, can I start back on my pills?
DOCTOR: Yeah that should be fine absolutely.  It shouldn't be a problem I'll give you a prescription for it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It probably will actually help with the blood pressure too.  Alright.  [REDACTED] okay you better be taking these medications.
PATIENT: Yeah, I mean like I said the only reason, the only reason.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] useful.
PATIENT: The only reason why I hadn't taken or continued to take it is because I didn't know which one was giving me the headaches.
DOCTOR: The next time call.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: At least call.  If you don't want to come in.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Then just call.
PATIENT: I didn't know that I could, I thought I had to schedule.
DOCTOR: Right.  So I'll give you the number and I'll talk with DOCTOR and that will help you [REDACTED].  Don’t just, you know, don’t do anything.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] lot of it too to make sure [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: That's the same thing my wife said and has been constantly telling me that uh that it may be something that's entirely different [REDACTED].  Really has changed my life.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: To the fullest you know and I can't.
DOCTOR: You're too young; you're too young to go okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So take care of yourself.
PATIENT: That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: I'm glad you came [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You have to come here more regularly.
PATIENT: Yes I will, yeah I will, like I said I just um got certain things in front of it, at least my appointment would be, it would be on a day when something else that.
DOCTOR: Nothing's more important than your health.
PATIENT: Right.  Alright.
DOCTOR: Nothing.
PATIENT: Believe me, I get this told to me constantly with my wife you know.
DOCTOR: I know, I'm not trying to be naggy.
PATIENT: No it's great but you know, for me it has to be close because it's not, you know, like I did with my prostate all these years I waited [REDACTED] I could have got the surgery a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But I kept putting it off, putting it off, putting it off and putting it off.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Even waited until it got so serious I was going to the Emergency Room [REDACTED].  So I got the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You can't do that with this problem cause it'll kill you.  If it's gonna get worse it's gonna get worse I'm not gonna tell you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right, right, right, right.
DOCTOR: It's different.
PATIENT: Okay doc.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah don't forget it.
PATIENT: I won't.
DOCTOR: Have a nice weekend.
PATIENT: Okay, thanks a lot now.
