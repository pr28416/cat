DOCTOR: Patient?  Hi, how are you this morning?  How are you?
PATIENT: It's been really wild.
DOCTOR: Excuse me?  Hmm?
PATIENT: Bet you're my new doctor.
DOCTOR: Right here, okay.
PATIENT: After you.
DOCTOR: I'll take it.  Yes I am DOCTOR.
PATIENT: I can't pronounce that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's fine.  Oh bar, like a metal bar and then the watch around your wrist.
PATIENT: DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Yeah DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Right in here.  Just sit, one second. Iâ€™ll be right back.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Alright, falling asleep on me already?
PATIENT: Been a long day.
DOCTOR: Well I'll try to make this a little shorter.  Um PATIENT, what can we do for you today?
PATIENT: I'm just here to.
DOCTOR: Follow-up.
PATIENT: Yeah, well it's uh.
DOCTOR: Great I love follow-ups.
PATIENT: This is, I'm supposed to see you.  You're supposed to be my new uh.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: My new uh general practitioner.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh the other question is uh I don't understand why there wasn't a uh, a uh thing in for blood work.
DOCTOR: Today?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Let's take a look shall we um.
PATIENT: And I spoke with the lady when I spoke to her a few weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She told me that uh I was given a new primary care doctor.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: So I asked her first well okay, set up the date and I asked her do I have to you know, I'll come in and have the blood work done.  She says well nobody's put in anything for a blood work or anything.  I says well you know I don't know how long you've been doing this job but generally when they change from one doctor to another doctor.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They do a blood work; this way here the incoming doctor knows what's going on because I think my last blood work was in January.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm actually looking at it right now and to be honest with you there was nothing I noticed that I found to be too concerning.  So usually when that happens, when patients seem to be doing really well and we're not following up on anything acutely then once a year is fine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So, you know that's not a problem for me.  I mean was there anything that you were concerned about in particular?
PATIENT: No, the primarily uh the cholesterol count.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So it.
PATIENT: That was the uh big thing.  Because I'm out of my cholesterol medication and.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If I can get the, if I can get the.
DOCTOR: Absolutely.
PATIENT: The medication.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's fine and then in the next three months when I come in to see you or whatever.
DOCTOR: We'll get you back on the medication and we'll check the cholesterol.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's perfect.  Actually I refilled it so I think it'll be ready for you to pick up downstairs, let me just double check.  Do you, would you, lets try that again, alright.  Let's take a look at the details.  Um so I had put it to be mailed to you at home.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: The cholesterol medication is not urgent.  I don't want you to waste your time downstairs.
PATIENT: Now usually what I do.  Usually I order mine online.
DOCTOR: Oh really?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you want me to cancel this or?
PATIENT: No, no, no, no, no.
DOCTOR: Okay keep it.
PATIENT: No let it go, this way I don't know how many other refills are behind this.
DOCTOR: Um let's see, what did I put it in for, so a 90-day supply with three refills.  That's the most they let me do, 270 days.
PATIENT: Okay, that's fine.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because uh it's a half a tablet that I take.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: In the evening so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's actually, that works out fine.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's fine.  That's, that was the biggest concern.  I don't have any aches or pains or anything.  Nothing to speak of, other than old age.  Uh I'll be back here the 6th of September.
DOCTOR: So you know actually looking at your cholesterol level that was taken in January, if you're doing everything the same and we get you back on the same medication um I don't think it'll be a problem.  Your last numbers were actually very good.
PATIENT: Yeah the medication that they put me on the simvastatin or whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Yeah simvastatin.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Did its job.
PATIENT: It's doing its job.  It's not like I go out and have steaks and everything every day or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But uh no, everything.
DOCTOR: Great.
PATIENT: As long as I don't have to, if I don't have to be here I don't want to be here.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean we still recommend coming in once a year, even if you're completely healthy just so we can go over things like you're blood pressure's great, your temperature's fine, your heart rate is great.  The weight's a little high.
PATIENT: Yeah, that I, that I got to work on.
DOCTOR: Yeah so do you uh is there anything in particular you'd like me to talk about this visit?
PATIENT: Uh no sir.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But if I have any questions in the near future.
DOCTOR: Oh absolutely.
PATIENT: I can probably reach you online.
DOCTOR: Online not so much.  Clinic would be the best and easiest way and then that way cause you know if we.  If you e-mail me and then I e-mail you back then there's this gap, there's this delay, I don't know.
PATIENT: Having to wait.
DOCTOR: Exactly.  This is what I want to show you.  This is the weight.  This is the trend that we have for the weight.  So today when you came in we had you at 270 and you know if I look at it, it really looks like since about well we'll say go ahead to 2006, the weight's steadily been going up.  Actually there was a three year gap right here so it's almost been pretty steady growth.  I mean do you have any ideas as to why that is?
PATIENT: No other than the fact that I smoke.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I've been out of work for the last two years so I'm inactive.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh, it's probably really what it is.
DOCTOR: So let's talk a little bit about that.  We'll kind of make that the issue for the day but since I have a bit of time you know they cause my next patient's scheduled at 11:15 so I have a half an hour.  Um let me just try to get a little bit of background history and update your chart, make sure that everything is okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so in here, what I'm reading is that you know in the past, before we had the medication you had high cholesterol.  You also had a problem with arthritis in one of the knees.
PATIENT: Uh yeah.
DOCTOR: Which knee was that, left, right or both?
PATIENT: Both. It's more like when uh, the weather changes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know it's an age thing.  I don't think it's uh, you know I don't think I hurt my legs or anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you know the thing is the osteoarthritis it gets worse with the weight going up.  It's just more wear and tear for your legs.  So if the weight, as it is right now, 270 pounds.  That's 70 pounds of weight gain you know since [REDACTED]@ in the last six years.
PATIENT: That's a lot.
DOCTOR: Yeah that is a lot.  That's a lot of stress on your knees every day that they kind of have to deal with.  So if your knees are bothering you, yeah weather changes will make it worse but weight changes will make it worse for the rest of your life.  It's just more wear and tear.  So that's why I want to work on the weight.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um I'm also reading that you know there's been a history in the past with depression and post-traumatic stress is that right or you tell me.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: As a matter of fact I'm going through uh 228.
DOCTOR: Okay and how do you feel that that's going?
PATIENT: Uh well I just started.  Just like uh.
DOCTOR: Just uh.
PATIENT: My third week.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Is it helping?  Do you feel?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Things are moving in the right direction?
PATIENT: Well the first time I went into this thing it was a group thing.  Uh I don't like writing things down.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay I just don't like it.  I don't like the fact that they turn around and somebody says write it down so the more you, I don't have to write it down to remember it.  The incident that happened in Vietnam, I don't like to write it down.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's there and it wakes me up in the middle of the night.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh I get uh, I feel like I have restless leg syndrome.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh doesn't matter what time of the year it is but I'll, I'll go for a walk, I'll go for a walk and I'm gone.  I'm gone for hour, hour and a half.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh in the session that I'm in right now it's like on a one to one basis and uh I feel like they're trying to pull me into saying something.  Uh last week they asked me says when you're calm you know 0-100 they have this scale, when you're calm you know how do you feel?  Where are you the most calm at?  I'm most calm at home, front porch, you know where there's no stress or anything.  Where I feel the most is in crowds.  I don't go to ballgames.  Uh I try to avoid large crowds.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Period.  If I walk into a building I don't care if I've been in this building 100 times.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: When I walk through that first door first thing I look for is an exit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I want to be able to get out if something happens.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If I feel that my anxiety gets too high.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I want to be able to get out.  I don't want to be, I don't want to be suppressed.  I don't want to you know be held someplace where I don't want to be.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If I go to a picnic uh it's fine.  I'm outside because I have the freedom that if something doesn't feel right to me I can leave.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Uh I distance myself from a lot of people that I used to know.  There are a lot of things that I used to do, that I enjoyed doing, I don't do anymore.  Uh I'm fine as long as my mind and hands are occupied.  I do little crafts around the house.  Sometimes I have the guy downstairs and he hands out those crafts and stuff, I'll pick up one of those things and it gives me something to do when I'm at the house.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: You know before I forget to ask I did want to mention um I read that you were on the trazodone to help you go to sleep at night.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Has that been working for you?
PATIENT: Uh only as needed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Only as needed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's the whole thing.  I already take as needed.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I don't like taking medications doc.  Uh I take my cholesterol medication because I know that I need it and I have to keep that in control but I do not want to become dependent on a sleep medication.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So yes I have used it.  I don't fill it as often as I should.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But if I feel that you know, I feel that I need it I take it.  I don't take it every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no that's perfectly fine and since it's written as needed then that's okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's up to you to decide when you want to take it.  Um what I will say is that you know I understand your sentiment about not wanting to take medication.  The two medications we have you on right now, the statin and the aspirin that you take outside as well.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Right, those are good medications to be taking.  Um they're gonna do great things to protect your heart.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Protect you from having heart attacks and having strokes.  The only other problem is you know if the weight goes up.  I mean actually the weight level we're at right now, 270 pounds, is too high and it's gonna be the kind of thing where you're only 65 right now but if you'd stay at this weight in another five years, maybe even faster than that, you're gonna start to develop a lot of health problems which will require medications.  So if we work.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: On getting this weight under control now we can just keep you on the three medications you're on right now.
PATIENT: That'll work.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: There's uh.
DOCTOR: So uh.
PATIENT: The young lady uh the prep nurse.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She gave me uh; she gave me my pneumonia vaccination.
DOCTOR: Perfect.
PATIENT: Uh she gave me this MOVE.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Actually yeah that's what I was gonna talk about as well but since they talked to you about that already that.
PATIENT: That and uh the way to quit tobacco.  I got all the literature.  She did a good job of presenting her case and everything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So of the two things having you quit tobacco is I think just as important as and you know the thing is.  Actually let me ask you, you're smoking ten cigarettes a day still or?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So what I want you to do is try to cut down on that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I think that your goal should be at five cigarettes a day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I think you should get there and stay there in the next two months.  Do you think you can do that?  Or what do you think would be more reasonable?
PATIENT: That's an attainable goal.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I can do that.  I can do that.
DOCTOR: If you can quit, I mean, don't stop at five if you feel like you can go any further.
PATIENT: Well you know it's kind of funny.  Uh when my son was born.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And my son's in his 30s right now.  When my son was born I quit smoking and then uh when he was about 12 or 13, he was in an accident and I snapped.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Because you should, the accident shouldn't have happened so on the way driving from Chicago to Wisconsin I picked up a pack of cigarettes and I just started smoking again.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think it was more a lack of worry.
DOCTOR: Stress can definitely do it.
PATIENT: And I think that's what did most of it.
DOCTOR: The thing is we have to find better ways of dealing with the stress and actually you know the Mental Health people are gonna be the ones that can really help you with that.  I understand that some of the you know activities that they have you do aren't ones that you're necessarily a fan of like writing things down.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But talk to them and see if there's any other alternatives.
PATIENT: Well I'm on the one to one basis right now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh right now they're recording my sessions and I sit there and we talk but it's not talk as in like we're doing now okay.  She's going down this book.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know, talks about this, talks about this, talk about this uh.  Where is your stress level?  What is the medium stress?  I don't know what a medium stress level is.  I couldn't, I know what my high stress level is and I know how calm I am.  I have no clue what a middle is.  I have no clue what a middle is.  I tend to leave areas when I feel uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay.  There's um, there's also do you remember DOCTOR?  DOCTOR or DOCTOR, he was a clinical psychologist.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That saw you back in May.  Are you still in contact with him?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: He's the one that got me into this One on One Program.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But you still follow-up with him personally?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I, right now, when I talk to somebody else over there it's a NAME.
DOCTOR: At Mental Health?
PATIENT: Yeah.  She's the one that prescribed the trazodone.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And we'll sit down and we'll talk you know.  It's easier to talk when you're not reading it out of a book.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know what I'm saying?
DOCTOR: No I agree with you.
PATIENT: You know it's like, it's like somebody's looking at you and they're reading a instruction manual.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: On how to deal with you.  It's fine but, kind of gives you that uneasy feeling there for a while.  You know they have a good system and everything, I just feel that it's too book, too much book.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But you know, that's just my opinion.
DOCTOR: Alright, well.  Here's kind of what I want to focus on.  Um I should first, let me ask you in terms of your overall mood uh do you feel like you're currently depressed or too anxious?
PATIENT: I'm not depressed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh I'm always anxious even, I'm always anxious.  Uh somebody turns around and tells me well we're gonna leave at 3:30, quarter to 3 I'm ready to go.  I'll sit and wait for the 45 minutes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  3:30 you ain't ready I'm gone.  Don't tell me we're gonna do something at a certain time and then, I understand things happen but you have so much time to get from point A to point B and you want to be there at a certain time, let's get on the, let's go.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let me just fill, these are some of the things that the VA wants me to talk to you about.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: One of them is the smoking which we've already kind of done.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We've come up with a plan and I think it's reasonable and you told me that it's reasonable.
PATIENT: Yeah, it's attainable.
DOCTOR: Yeah five cigarettes and the way, the easiest way to do it is just you know realize that at the end of this week um smoking one less cigarette a day.  So all you do to stop smoking five, so this week ten, next week nine then eight, then seven, then six, then five.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: In other words if I eliminate one cigarette this week.
DOCTOR: One cigarette a day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: For the week.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um so that's, we're gonna taper you down and you are willing to quit is that right?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The last time I was in here I talked to the doctor and he told me he says well we have programs here to help you.
DOCTOR: Can I see, which exactly which one she gave you?
PATIENT: Right uh.
DOCTOR: Somewhere in here?
PATIENT: All three of them and the pneumonia shot, the other one is.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah you know I'm gonna have to say and anyway he turned around and he told me he says well we have programs here to help you quit.  I said okay fine.   He says how about if we put you in for the, what do you call it the patch.  I was okay fine you know.  Never heard anything else about it.
DOCTOR: Here's what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna place a consult to the Stop Smoking Clinic.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And usually what they do is that they'll try to get a hold of you and figure out when would be a good time scheduling wise.  Um the other thing is there is a program here.  I wonder if this is the same one, I can check out the numbers.
PATIENT: Oh it's the.
DOCTOR: Yeah the 1-800 QUIT NOW okay.  So look into this program.  I mean take a look at this brochure and then call the number and ask them and tell them you're ready.
PATIENT: Yes uh the lady told me that there was uh, I can go to this thing here and take a little survey thing online.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  Okay, we got a plan.
DOCTOR: The other thing that we have to do, let's see, let me put this in.  So one of the things that can happen, one second so uh.  You know this is very frustrating for me.  Now we have to do this on the computer while we, while we have the encounter.  In the old days I could write and talk at the same time.  I can't do the same because there's all this clicking and everything that goes into it.  So it's just my thing to deal with.  The other thing that's important to talk about is someone your age with a history of smoking cause one of the things smoking does is it damages the blood vessels and there's actually a very important and very big blood vessel that runs through your entire body basically from here to here.  It's called your aorta.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: And it's sort of like in the back right by the spinal column and what can happen is over time smoking can damage it and make it sort of swell up and once it's swelled it actually becomes weaker cause the walls kind of stretch and what we worry about is in people that have these large aortas is that they can sort of burst and it's a very, very serious medical condition.  Actually roughly 50% of the people that have that happen to them will never even make it into the hospital.  I mean that's it for them.
PATIENT: It's a major blood vessel.
DOCTOR: Yeah it is the major blood vessel.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So what we recommend is once you get to around the age of 65, which you know you're at right now, we screen you for it and it's a one-time thing.  Basically what we do is we do an ultrasound and take a look see how big it is.  If it's bigger than normal and normal is about 2 cm or about 1 inch, 1 1/2 inches and it can get all the way up to 2 1/2 inches and if it's big then we need to follow it closely and make sure it's not getting bigger too quickly.  And if it reaches a certain size then we can do a surgery before you know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It ruptures and the outcome is way better if that's the case.  So what I would like to do, with your permission, is just schedule you for an ultrasound.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we'll go ahead and.
PATIENT: Schedule me for a brain transplant if you need.
DOCTOR: Well you gotta wait your turn I might need one of those too.  So let's see we have the ultrasound and that's fine.  Okay great, finish.
PATIENT: Alright doc but I'll be here; I'll be back in the hospital here September 6th.  I'll be here September 6th at the Eye Clinic downstairs, September 6th.
DOCTOR: Let's go ahead and put that in for that.  Uh is that in the morning, the Eye Clinic?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I'll put the order in for 5 a.m. but they really should be able to do it anytime so just go down to Radiology and on that day just ask them, let them know that and I need an ultrasound where do I go for that and they'll point you in the right direction.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I can tell you know I mean you know September 6th.
PATIENT: Well Radiology is on the first floor right by the Lab.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  So I mean that's uh, that's it for me.  You know what I'll also do; I'll repeat the lipid panel on September 6th, that sound okay?
PATIENT: Lipid panel?
DOCTOR: Oh to check for the cholesterol and everything.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Actually, no once a year is fine.  You did have it in January.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So we don't need to do it any time faster than that.
PATIENT: We can do it in uh.
DOCTOR: It was actually right at the beginning of the year so we can do it after the winter holidays.
PATIENT: That'll work.
DOCTOR: Okay so that.
PATIENT: I mean the only other time I'll have to draw blood is if I come in here for something else.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  So I mean it's not a problem.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Right now everything's good.  Uh just a few quick questions from me.  Are you having any fevers or chills?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: Any shortness of breath or cough?
PATIENT: I have a cough.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I think it's related to smoking.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Has that cough been the same for the last couple years?
PATIENT: It's been the same for the last uh.
DOCTOR: Couple decades?
PATIENT: Cute no uh actually it's only; it's gotten worse in the last three months.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The last three months it's really gotten worse but you know like I say I think I attribute most of it now, being as though we're having this conversation about smoking regarding to that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So uh.
DOCTOR: Any crushing chest pain or pressure, chest pressure where you feel like you can't breathe?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But uh on occasion, it'll start hurting behind here in my left arm.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What kind of pain is that?
PATIENT: Uh like a dull numbing pain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not sharp or anything.  It's just more; it's more like you know when your hand falls asleep.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And you try to get it back up to get that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's just that numb feeling and it just, it's just annoying sometimes.  Then other times my hands will.
DOCTOR: How often does that happen, that numb feeling?  Uh would you say once a week, once a month, once a day?
PATIENT: Uh it was uh, if I had to put an average on it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'd say every two weeks.
DOCTOR: And are you doing anything that makes that happen?
PATIENT: Not unless I'm sleeping wrong but I doubt that uh.
DOCTOR: For example uh how far can you walk before you get tired or out of breath?
PATIENT: Oh I can walk for an hour.
DOCTOR: Okay and does that cause the arm pain?
PATIENT: No.  No.
DOCTOR: Okay can you climb uh, how many flights of stairs can you climb?
PATIENT: I climb a flight of stairs every day.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any pain in the arm when that happens?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh I ride my motorcycle and I don't even know if the sun's shining or not.  Uh here lately I've become uh a since July.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So actually PATIENT what I want to do is since you're here I just want to look you over.  Listen to your heart, your lungs; take a look at your stomach.  Uh just go ahead and have a seat up there and we'll lay you flat.  Actually I'll go ahead and listen from the back and then I'll have you lie flat.  But it doesn't sound like it's a heart pain to me.  Now the problem, the thing I get worried about is if it's every time you walk, every time you exerted yourself, every time you climb stairs you are having chest pain, shortness of breath, you felt sweaty, nauseous.
PATIENT: No uh those are heart attack symptoms.
DOCTOR: Exactly.  So this I think is musculoskeletal.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And I think it's just you know from using the arm.  Let me go ahead and take a listen.  Uh do me a favor, nice deep breaths with your mouth open.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So just go in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, one more great.  Alright the lungs sound clear.  Go ahead and take a listen.  You can breathe normally again.  Actually let's have you lie down, it might help you feel a little bit better.  Let's take a look at the stomach.  Any pain when I push?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: When I push?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: When I push?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: No, how about here?
PATIENT: Now that's a little tender.
DOCTOR: How long has that been going on?
PATIENT: For years.
DOCTOR: For years.  Any problems with bowel movements?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any blood in the stools?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Dark stool?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Diarrhea or constipation?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  That's fine, sit up.  How often do you have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Twice a day.
DOCTOR: Twice a day.
PATIENT: I have one in the morning and then I have one uh later on that day.
DOCTOR: Any fevers or chills?
PATIENT: No.  Usually on occasion I try, if I have a fever or a chill, it's uh.
DOCTOR: Alright you can have a seat back on the chair.
PATIENT: Usually it's from uh being caught in the rain or whatever.  The thing is if I feel sick I don't go by my great grandson.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't need them to get sick when grandpa's not feeling well.
DOCTOR: Alright so that's the plan alright.  Ultrasound when you come back in.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh also we'll get, wow there's no other labs actually we've decided no labs for now.  So we'll repeat the lipid panel in one year.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright and that's it.  Following Mental Health and then the smoking.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So let me go uh talk to DOCTOR, who is my supervising physician.  I'll tell her everything that you've told me.  She'll come in and ask just a few questions, they'll more or less be the same but see if she has any different recommendations alright.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I'll be back in just, probably about a minute.
PATIENT: Alright thank you.

PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um.  When was the last time you were checked?
PATIENT: Every time they the blood, the last time they drew blood.
DOCTOR: We don't do HIV when we draw the blood.
DOCTOR: Yeah we usually need your permission to screen for it specifically so it's not in the included blood tests.  If you want we can go ahead and screen you and sort of.
DOCTOR: Why, you'll take that permission.
PATIENT: I'm going right down to have blood taken and you might as well have everything done right now.
DOCTOR: So that's what I'll do that, yeah and then um then just one more thing.  You need a booster shot for whooping cough um.  It's coming back up again so we are giving booster shots for all the vets.

DOCTOR: Alright so you know that's what we'll do.  We'll get you that shot because you mentioned you were around your grandson so I told DOCTOR and she said you know once you get 65 and you're right there, so we figured.
PATIENT: Oh how do I get that?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] out a little bit.
PATIENT: Yeah I already got the pneumonia.  It's not, it's no uh.
DOCTOR: Link between the two.
PATIENT: There's no interaction of these?

DOCTOR: There will not be.
PATIENT: Alright.  I just want to make sure I'm not uh driving down the street and I start hallucinating.
DOCTOR: So here's what I'm gonna do, since we're gonna do that vitamin D level, actually DOCTOR was very thorough.  She went back to 2009.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And it looks like it was low then so we can't really do anything based off that value in 2009 cause it's [REDACTED]@ now.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So let's see how it is in the meantime.  Maybe it's improved.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Maybe it hasn't um but since I'm doing that and we're doing the HIV screening, we're sticking you anyway uh I'm gonna go ahead and bump those, some of the other tests that we talked about up just normal routine stuff.
PATIENT: Yeah the.
DOCTOR: That we went over.
PATIENT: The cholesterol and everything.
DOCTOR: The cholesterol, did you eat this morning?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  You haven't eaten anything since yesterday for dinner?
PATIENT: That's right.
DOCTOR: No coffee, no juice, nothing.  Oh mind if I add that on?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So we'll get the full panel you know.
PATIENT: Yeah, so when I stopped in at the Lab this morning the girl asked and says did you eat anything I said yeah I had steak and eggs uh.  She says no I got.  I says no I haven't had anything since yesterday.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So that's why I stopped at the Lab thing to have the blood drawn but there was no order in.
DOCTOR: So let's see where is my [REDACTED].  You know what, I'll actually I won't look for it right now.  I'll talk to the nurse and let her know.  You hear that too right.  So we'll do that and we'll get you out of here.  Alright so there we go.  We talked about this, this, this and this alright and you did agree to get screened so I put the order in already.
PATIENT: And the cholesterol medication will be sent in the mail to me.
DOCTOR: Yep just like we talked about.
PATIENT: That'll work.
DOCTOR: Alright so here we go and this is it.  Alright and lets sign all this fun stuff and get you going.  Oh this is signed.  Go ahead and find the nurse and let her know and then six months should be fine, sooner if there are any problems.
PATIENT: Yeah.  That's what usually happens you know.  Unless I don't have to be here, I come in here for other things.
DOCTOR: And you know what's gonna keep you out is working on smoking and the weight.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I mean if you can get those two under control by yourself then you might just have to deal with me once a year.
PATIENT: I can deal with that, that's probably ideal.
DOCTOR: Alright so, take this to the clerk.  Actually, uh just [REDACTED] let her know you need your shot.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Sorry you have to meet with them but don't leave quite yet.
PATIENT: I won't.
