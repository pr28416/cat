DOCTOR: PATIENT.  How you doing?
PATIENT: Fine, fine.
DOCTOR: How have you been doing?
PATIENT: Oh fair to midland we'll say.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  That's good.  That's always the question.
PATIENT: Each day gets a little slower.
DOCTOR: Does it?
PATIENT: Yes it does.
DOCTOR: Were you [REDACTED] for Halloween?
PATIENT: Uh no, just answering the door.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: With the kids.
DOCTOR: Well that'll be fun.
PATIENT: A lot of the children out the east coast are sad.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: What a disaster holy cow.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: That's horrible.
DOCTOR: Seriously.
PATIENT: Horrible.
DOCTOR: So what's new?
PATIENT: Well since I've last seen you I've had carpal tunnel done on my hands again.
DOCTOR: You have okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  That's still uh.
DOCTOR: Feeling better?
PATIENT: No but that's the end of it.  But I've had it done three times in each hand.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: And this time they had to open my hands up and they said this is the last time to do it.  I own my age and the size of my hands.
DOCTOR: Anything else new?
PATIENT: Oh just once in the summer I was a little dizzy with the heat but that was at.
DOCTOR: Did you get, did you have to go to the hospital?
PATIENT: Uh yes I did.  I went and had a stress test and everything, my heart doctor.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And they checked it out and that was about it and I've had a sleep test.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I guess I'm gonna go see a sleep doctor.  Whatever, what do they call it again?
DOCTOR: Sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Sleep apnea yes and one of the heart doctors thought that might be a part of my heart.  I have a little bleep in my heart all the time and so that's what they said to do that.
DOCTOR: To do what?
PATIENT: Have a sleep test.
DOCTOR: Did you have the sleep test already?
PATIENT: Yes I've had that done.
DOCTOR: And it says that you have sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Well no I haven't met with the man that read the test yet.
DOCTOR: Oh, gotcha.
PATIENT: That's within a week or two I go meet with him.
DOCTOR: Gotcha.
PATIENT: But the one heart doctor, a different doctor that reads some of the things he says take the magnesium and I've been taking magnesium and it helps.
DOCTOR: For what?
PATIENT: You need it in your system, it helps you.  So now I feel a lot better.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What is it?
PATIENT: But the heat was the big problem.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: This summer was horrible.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But other than that I'm fine.  My arthritis is killing me but otherwise what are you gonna do.
DOCTOR: Are you taking anything for it?
PATIENT: Just the meloxicam is for the arthritis.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Oh right but you have to take that.
PATIENT: Oh yes I take all my medications.
DOCTOR: Does it help?
PATIENT: I hope so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean nothings gonna do, make it that perfect anymore.
DOCTOR: And you have another outside primary care doctor is that right?
PATIENT: Uh I have my family doctor; it's been 40 years DOCTOR in Villa Park.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: And then a heart doctor which is DOCTOR in Elmhurst Hospital.
DOCTOR: And he's the one that gave you the magnesium?
PATIENT: That's a lady.  Pardon?
DOCTOR: Sheâ€™ the one that gave you the magnesium, is she the one that gave you the magnesium?
PATIENT: Uh it was another one of the heart doctors that she referred to.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause he read, he looked into why I got the beep in my heart.  They all know that.  I've had it for years.  Everybody thinks like, when they take my blood pressure or something or whatever it is when they listen to my heart they always probably get a little beep, a little jump or something.
DOCTOR: Huh.
PATIENT: See so but, but I've had that for years and years and years.
DOCTOR: But no new chest pain or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, none of that no.  There was one thing I asked last time.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And doggone it again, why can't we get montelukast.  That's for my asthma?  I can't get a 90 day fill on it.  It's only 30 day fill so that's 12 times a year I gotta keep calling for that one thing.  That's a lot of postage and then we damn waste it.
DOCTOR: Did I order it?
PATIENT: Yeah everything is 90 days.
DOCTOR: I changed it.
PATIENT: I know you did but it still comes 30.
DOCTOR: I don't know why.
PATIENT: It comes in one bottle.
DOCTOR: I've changed it again.
PATIENT: Yeah it comes and the last time, the last one I ran low and I called in and it says oh it's over with and it wasn't over with.
DOCTOR: Huh.  Hmm.  I'm sorry about that.  I keep changing it on my end and I already had changed it.
PATIENT: Well it only comes in, they send me the exact bottle and it comes that way with only 30 tablets in it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Like you know so it's a sealed bottle.  But I get most of the medications in larger quantities just break them down.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  And your stress test this summer was negative?
PATIENT: Yeah everything was fine.  Yeah oh yeah.  I've had all of that.
DOCTOR: And you got your labs done today.
PATIENT: Yeah.  You got any report on that yet?
DOCTOR: There well your CBC looks fine.
PATIENT: How about the cholesterol I tried.
DOCTOR: That's still pending so.
PATIENT: Oh cause I fight with that.  Oh I don't fight; I try to keep it real low.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The heart doctors want it low and I've been doing it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I'm very faithful with all of my medications.  I take them exact like I'm supposed to.
DOCTOR: I believe you.  Well your blood pressure looks good.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  I still go three days a week to the hospital and exercise.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: At Elmhurst Hospital.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Cardiac rehab I've been doing that for 12 years now.  It's a hard nut to crack but I still do it.  And we open up the hospital at 6:30 in the morning so I got to get up at 5:30 to do that.
DOCTOR: Take a seat up here my friend let me take a quick look at you.
PATIENT: Alright.  You'll probably hear the little bleep.  Oh then another thing that the sleep test is, my heart gets real slow sometimes when I sleep.
DOCTOR: Does it?
PATIENT: It drops real low yes.
DOCTOR: Like how low?
PATIENT: Uh 38, I think once the heartbeat was 38.
DOCTOR: Big deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: And these, at the hospital every time we used a machine or anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: We used one of these cleaning things and I store them in my pocket and I haven't had a cold now in four or five years.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: That's better than I've done.
PATIENT: Oh I've been lucky and I wash my hands 100 times a day and I use that what's you're doing there.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Yeah.  No swelling of the legs or feet or anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well that's good.
PATIENT: The only thing is I just bruise a lot more now in my older age.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: A lot more bruising but other than that.  But.
DOCTOR: Are you still using the Albuterol a couple times a week?
PATIENT: The albuterol I, not really, yeah maybe once or twice a day maybe.
DOCTOR: Once or twice a day?
PATIENT: Yes.  And when I was in the hospital for that check-up, they take that away from you and I says well they gave me, this is what I used to have years ago.  This was from hospital and this has both.  This is kind of like a preventive and a helper.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It was a double but albuterol is just for emergency.  What was the other one?  Albuterol and I forget the name of the other one.  I used to have a double but then they had these years back.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And this is what the hospital gave me for the day I was in there.  They won't let you bring your own.
DOCTOR: Really oh.
PATIENT: Oh yeah when you go in there right.
DOCTOR: Yeah I could see that.
PATIENT: You can't bring your own medications.
DOCTOR: That's true.  Let me go talk to the other doctors I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna check with them and I'll be right back to you so I'm gonna take your medication list.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: 40:50  DOCTOR IN:  45:55
DOCTOR: Alright then.  Everything looks good.
PATIENT: That's good.
DOCTOR: And what I will do is follow up on these labs when they return and send you a letter with them cause it might take a while before they come back with your lipids.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And if we need to make any changes I'll call you.
PATIENT: Okay.  Uh the letter that tells me to call in to make an appointment.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
