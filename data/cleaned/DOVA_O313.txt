DOCTOR: For the eyes we will send you to uh, I'll ask them to schedule a follow-up for you in the Eye Clinic.  You saw them, if you see them within like a two year period they don't count you as a new patient, you're a follow-up one so if they can't schedule you you'll have to call and just say I want to make a follow-up appointment.
