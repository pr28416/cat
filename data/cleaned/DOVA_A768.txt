DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Mr. PATIENT?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's me.
DOCTOR: Hi.
PATIENT: Hi.
DOCTOR: How's it going?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Have a seat back here [REDACTED] for me.  Anything specific bring you in today?
PATIENT: Yep.  But we'll get to that.  First thing's is uh take care of this.  I'm not taking any of this stuff right now.  One, two and four I don't even have and number three were stopped when they took me off the naproxen.
DOCTOR: Um, well these.
PATIENT: So what do I need?  I don't know.
DOCTOR: Is there, how many of them are you taking there?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: How many of these were you taking cause it looks like they're expired?
PATIENT: Right.  So aside from that, my doctor, civilian doctor called me in January because my uh prescription for my thyroid medication had expired and she said she had to see me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So okay so as a result of seeing her, she took my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So now I'm taking this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then I told her that I was having trouble sleeping with the pain so she gave me this stuff.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Okay.
PATIENT: She also had me get all of these blood tests.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now the reason I'm here is cause you wanted me to come in here because I wanted to see a spine specialist and the only way to do that is to get a referral from you.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So that's why I'm here and I got another issue today.  Well it's not just today it's been for the last three weeks, this paraquadrant hurts and I think it's from getting up and down and strained something in there.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But like if I sneeze or cough you know I get a shot in the back and the shoulder blade and all of that and uh so now it's up to you.
DOCTOR: Well, so you have a history of spinal stenosis.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But we’ve not imaged the spine here.  How do you now that you have spinal stenosis?
PATIENT: How do I know?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well other doctors in the past have told me that that's what I had.
DOCTOR: How did they know?
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: Did they do an MRI?  Did they . . .
PATIENT: No I don't think I've had an MRI.  Uh probably based on the fact that I had the spine operation in '68 and there's a lot of scar tissue there, you know I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What did they do?  Why did you have a spine operation?
PATIENT: Cause I had a ruptured disk and they took it out or fused it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or whatever they did at L5.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And since I've been having more pain, uh in that area and my SI joints some days is really a killer.  I want to get something done and have my spine examined or something.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  You had a fusion surgery of L5?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I guess that's what.
DOCTOR: With like rods and [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: No, no, no rods.  He said it would fuse itself because I was so young.
DOCTOR: You don't have any metal in your body?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay, no shrapnel even?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And what are your symptoms?  You can't walk?
PATIENT: Well, lately I've been getting more and more pain in the scar tissue area and in the SI joint.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And once I stand for a while then my back starts hurting and I got to lay down and you know ease the pain and even walking from the parking lot here caused me some, not a lot of pain but some discomfort in the back you know, in the lower back, the SI joint and I want to, see I'm scheduled to get another shot at the end of this month, the 27th.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now am I going to be wasting my time because the hip is getting the pain from the spine or what you know, because they can only do this every six, I mean every three months and it only lasts for four or five weeks you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So am I wasting my time getting the shots you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: Well I think you probably have both back pain and osteoarthritis.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So it'll help the osteoarthritis pain but we can also look into the back pain.  Just tell me a little bit more about it, what it feels like, do you have any numbness, tingling in the legs?
PATIENT: Well the pain in the back is a dull pain back here where the surgery was.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And the other, with the intensity of the SI joint, I don't know if it's a sharp pain, a dull pain, it's just you know really intense or what but I know the SI joint really sometimes hurts pretty bad.
DOCTOR: So that is dull and sharp pain or it isn't?
PATIENT: You know like with the intensity of the pain, how do you tell what a sharp pain is and a dull pain is?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.  All I know is it hurts like heck.
DOCTOR: What makes it better and what makes it worse?
PATIENT: Well getting off my, getting off my feet makes it better.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh sometimes laying down makes it better.  See I can do one thing at one time and something will hurt.  I can do the same thing another time and that thing won't hurt.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  So can you lean forward?  Like can you walk straight up or do you have to like lean forward?  Like in a store you may use a grocery cart and that makes it a little bit easier for you to walk?
PATIENT: Well when I got the cane I'm upright and the tendency with the shopping cart is to walk you know over, bent over you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: When I walk with the cane I'm upright.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: And you're okay with that?
PATIENT: Yeah.  So far I can still uh; you know I still have the strength to walk with just a cane.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: But uh.
DOCTOR: You don't need a walker?
PATIENT: Not yet no but now I'm sitting here now you know.  The pain goes to different places.  Now my knee's starting to hurt see.  Back feels okay now I'm sitting upright and all back feels okay.  The hip is a little sore but the knee's starting to hurt you know.  So I don't know, it's like my body's got switches in it and somebody's in there flipping all these different switches to make the pain go to different areas.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And when the four or five weeks that the shot worked, then this was more noticeable.  The pain on this side was more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know and uh I think it's coming up from the spine.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But and I want to make sure if it is or isn't you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So no numbness, no tingling?
PATIENT: Well not that you would say constant.
DOCTOR: But you have it?
PATIENT: Well let me put it to you this way, if I sit in my recliner and I don't have any socks on, my toes hurt.
DOCTOR: Is there a numbness and tingling?
PATIENT: They get all electrified in the tips, in the toes you know.
DOCTOR: But only if you take off your socks?
PATIENT: Yeah.  If my wife puts my socks on the pain goes away.  So I don't know what that's all about you know.  I don't know if it's just a reaction to the cold air that's in the room or what, I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know and it uh there are times when somewhere in the body, it'll feel like somebody just took a pin and went put, you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's just that and then sometimes it'll be somewhere else and another one you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But uh I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How's your mood?
PATIENT: How's my mood?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh I haven't threaten to kill anybody yet.
DOCTOR: So you're not depressed or unhappy?
PATIENT: Well naturally you're gonna have some depression with being in constant pain.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know, you uh, if you don't get a lot of sleep you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I can go to bed; I go to bed 11:30, 12 o'clock at night.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'm still in bed at 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock in the morning you know because I haven't gotten some restful sleep.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: This stuff only lasts about four hours and then you know I wake up in pain and I'd have to take another to go back to sleep you know and so I lay there tossing and turning, trying to find a position to get rid of the pain.  So when I find a position to get rid of that pain then a different one will come.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So do you want the amlodipine, do want these medications on here?
PATIENT: Well you can give it yeah if you can sure.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause it seems to be working because uh when I went there the blood pressure she had to take it two or three times, they took it, she said it was in the high 150s.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know, the top one and the low one was still too high too.
DOCTOR: Do you want 90 pills?
PATIENT: Sure.  I got enough to last me the rest of the week so they can mail it.
DOCTOR: Yep okay.  Alright, alright I think everything else you're pretty much up-to-date on.  Um we'll do labs next time you come but that's it.  Um
PATIENT: So you gonna read these or what?
DOCTOR: Yeah I looked at them.  There's nothing abnormal about it.
PATIENT: Cause geez she told my vitamin D was low.
DOCTOR: Um wait; I didn't see the vitamin D.
PATIENT: She said my cholesterol was borderline high.
DOCTOR: We checked your cholesterol here recently and let me see if I got this right.  LDL, yeah it was high there but it wasn't, oh it was [REDACTED] but it wasn't to [REDACTED] 118 get it lower than that.   And then what are you doing for the vitamin D?
PATIENT: Taking uh 6000 of D3.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: If that's good or not I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And she gave you thyroid medications?
PATIENT: Uh yeah.
DOCTOR: And she didn't start you on anything for cholesterol?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She said she wanted to do the blood tests again in two months and see if you know.  She told me to change my diet you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then she said you make an effort to do that and then we'll see if that drops it down you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She said it ain't real bad she said but it is uh higher than we'd like it to be.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She said my main concern at this time was your blood pressure you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because it was so high.  Of course the more they get me to come in there the more I gotta pay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She also told me to take my blood pressure medicine the way I'm supposed to take it instead of getting up out of bed, taking it and eating breakfast you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She said you're supposed to do it on an empty stomach.  But uh if I could get out of bed at a decent time every day at the same time you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It would be different but uh you know I get up and my wife's ready to eat her lunch you know.
DOCTOR: You get up late?
PATIENT: Sometimes I don't get out of bed till 12 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Why?
PATIENT: Because I'm tired.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: You know.  I'm so tired from not getting any restful sleep during the night.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know and four hours sleep, which is what you know that sleep stuff does, that only lasts you know for four hours.  Starting in the beginning I got six.
DOCTOR: Do you snore?
PATIENT: Probably, she says I do, I don't know, everybody snores.
DOCTOR: Has she ever seen you stop breathing when you snore?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Uh sleep apnea, I don't uh wake up because I can't breathe or anything like that you know uh and if I'm snoring I don't know I'm snoring.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.  I'm asleep.  If I'm snoring I'm getting sleep you know.
DOCTOR: You might have sleep apnea.  Do you want a sleep study?
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  It'll help you feel.  If you have sleep apnea you'll feel more rested after they put you on a CPAP if you have sleep apnea and that'll help you feel more rested.
PATIENT: Well if you can't sleep because of the pain what is the sleep test gonna do?
DOCTOR: Well I mean the pain, like if you're not sleeping and the pain can be worse but if it makes you go on to sleep then you maybe, you may have less pain.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But it's up to you.  I mean if you're not, if you really don't think that you know your breathing is stopping when you're sleeping.
PATIENT: I don't really think so no.
DOCTOR: But you are at risk because you're overweight and you're snoring so the likelihood that you have sleep apnea if nothing else [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So.  It is not, it seems reasonable to do a sleep study.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  And then what does that entail?
DOCTOR: Um you just come here.  I don't know if they do it early in the evening of if they do it at the end of the day.  Basically they record you sleeping and they [REDACTED].
PATIENT: What if you can't, what if you can't go to sleep?
DOCTOR: Um I think they ask you to come in sleep-deprived so that you do.  You know.
PATIENT: I'm sleep deprived now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So you should be able to fall asleep.  I don't know if they give you medications to make you fall asleep or not.  They may.
PATIENT: You know it's strange because I get all kinds of different pains.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I have gone to the Naprapath.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And laid on his table.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I could go to sleep just like that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now why I don't know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know cause I was going to him to get some heat compresses and you know on the area there.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh, after about half an hour I'm almost asleep.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know cause he leaves the room and all that you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I, its just I guess its just what that's made out of, the firmness of it and all of that that I could sleep on.  I'm sure my mattress could be a lot harder than it is but uh my wife says it's hard enough.  Although we don't sleep together anymore, she still said she's not going to get another mattress that's harder.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So what can I do?
DOCTOR: So what do think, sleep study or not?
PATIENT: When will it be?
DOCTOR: Whenever you're ready, they can schedule it for you.
PATIENT: Yeah, try anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Eliminate as much as I can.

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But he told me that I was supposed to wear it around here see.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I didn't, I tried that and it didn't work.
DOCTOR: Yeah.

PATIENT: Well all they did was.
DOCTOR: Your legs?
PATIENT: Oh for the legs and all that.

DOCTOR: And you haven't had physical therapy for your back yet right?
PATIENT: No.  I don't know what they could do, what kind of physical therapy could they do for my back?
DOCTOR: They'll teach you exercises and things.  If you could strengthen up the muscles it'll help control your pain.
PATIENT: Well I don't know how you can strengthen up muscles that you can't move because it causes too much pain.
DOCTOR: Right.

PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: Did you have symptoms of hypothyroidism?
PATIENT: Yeah.  She said that uh.
DOCTOR: What were your symptoms?
PATIENT: Well when this all first started, uh 20 some years ago, my fingers, tips of my fingers is what got the doctor to get me the thyroid tests.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: And that decreased the.
PATIENT: Well that went away yeah after I took the pills yeah.
DOCTOR: You weren't having any constipation or you weren't cold all the time or you didn't have decreased energy?
PATIENT: No.  Uh cause it turns out uh my wife's got hypothyroidism, my son's got hypothyroidism, uh my sister's got hypothyroidism so I guess it's a genetic thing.
DOCTOR: But the only symptom that you had was numbness in the fingers?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Nothing else, no constipation?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No cold intolerance?
PATIENT: No cause that was, I was working at the time you know.
DOCTOR: Well that shouldn’t matter.

PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um, let's see.  We'll get the x-rays um; we're going to get them today.
PATIENT: You know the tiredness that's uh; you can't attribute it to the hypothyroidism now today because I'm not getting any sleep you know.
DOCTOR: Right.  I'll um, okay we need to get that and then um, the physical therapy we can order that.
PATIENT: Should I still go through with the shot?
DOCTOR: From Ortho?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Yeah whatever makes you feel better you should do and how has your pain been controlled with the medications you're on, the tramadol, the hydrocodone?
PATIENT: I told you I ain't on any of that.  I'm not taking any of it.
DOCTOR: Why not?
PATIENT: I don't have any of it.  The only thing I got is that opta, whatever it is and that was only for when I was on the naproxen.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  You have a history of a GI bleed right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And have you had any follow up endoscopies?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay we should do a follow-up endoscopy too.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They haven't looked since 2010?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay we should do that too.
PATIENT: Why?
DOCTOR: Um just to make sure that the ulcer has healed.
PATIENT: Hmm.  That means I have to go to sleep, right?
DOCTOR: Um they, it's called conscious sedation.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Let me put in that consult too, we need to really schedule that.  [REDACTED] their clinic.  You know do mind going to the Lab today?
PATIENT: For what?
DOCTOR: To get a blood draw, because normally when you're seen by the GI doctors for that scope.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They want to make sure that you don't have any problems with your blood test.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we need to order the labs for that.  Are you taking any aspirin or anything?
PATIENT: No.  The other thing I was taking but I haven't taken it for two days was vitamin C.
DOCTOR: Are you out of those medications, cause you have refills?
PATIENT: I never sent the things in.
DOCTOR: Yeah you can call and tell them to send it in.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You have plenty of refills.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I know.  Do you know how many bottles of naproxen I got that I never ordered you know?
DOCTOR: Oh.  Sometimes they just send it.  The narcotics they probably won't send unless you ask for them.
PATIENT: Right but uh the naproxen I got.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Yeah.
PATIENT: I must have 600 pills of that stuff cause it just kept coming.
Trying to deal with the pain without taking a whole lot of medication, that's why I'm so concerned about getting the spine looked at.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because I'm sure that if it is the spine, whatever they can do to correct it will eliminate a lot of the pain and I won't have to be on the medication.
DOCTOR: Well with spinal stenosis it is a chronic pain illness.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well I want to find out if there's any, if they could find out what's wrong if there's a way to correct it.  If there ain't no way to correct it then what can I do you know.  I can't do nothing.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But uh.
DOCTOR: Would you be willing to have surgery?
PATIENT: Yeah.  If that would correct it.  You know uh I don't want to just numb the pain; I want to try and get to the source of the pain and get rid of it if that's possible.  If it's not possible well then it's not possible.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But you know that's uh my goal cause I got lots of years left.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That’s right.
DOCTOR: Okay, well let me, you can schedule your appointment with me.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um, well I don't think you're going to be able schedule with me; the clinic is going to call you so just ask up front if it's possible.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay and now I guess we go through the nurse; we want to do a pain assessment I’m going to just walk you over there.
PATIENT: A pain assessment.
DOCTOR: You know you're in pain right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So we have to assess.
PATIENT: Right, what do they have to assess me?  How are they going to feel it to assess it?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh well hopefully we'll get these x-rays, get some answers, get some physical therapy and then I'll most likely be referring, it sounds like its spinal stenosis.  I'll most likely be referring you to um the Anesthesia Pain Clinic.
PATIENT: So they gonna do injections?
DOCTOR: Yeah they can do injections.
PATIENT: What kind?  What do they call them?
DOCTOR: Epidural injections.
PATIENT: An epidural or something like that yeah.  I had a guy that wanted to do that last year but it was gonna cost me $3000.
DOCTOR: Well it won't cost you that much here.  So go ahead and sit in the chair now.  Alright.  (Doctor speaking to someone)  You can wait over here and the person who is assessing you will be back okay and then you're gonna go check out and then you're gonna go get the x-ray.  Okay.

PATIENT: Yeah okay.
