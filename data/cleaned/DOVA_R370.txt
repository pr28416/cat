DOCTOR: Well I [REDACTED] pretty healthy guy aside from your heart you know.  Well what I want you to see is the cardiologist.

DOCTOR: Once the cardiologist sees you then they can set you up whether or not you know you'll get a second opinion and you'll see what they're saying, you guys will put your heads together see whether or not you're gonna have the catheterization, right.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm going to see you after and manage you on all the other stuff but I just really want them to look, I want a cardiologist [REDACTED] don't want that to happen to you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um you know whether or not you need see the cardiologist today, that’s kind of up to debate. I'm kind of uneasy about um, about having you wait too long to see a cardiologist.
PATIENT: Okay.  That's why I have those notes from Holy Cross so you  really have something to really go on.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Um any swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: [REDACTED], they're pretty well swollen you know that's normal [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How long have your legs been swelling up like this?

PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Uh about five or six years.
DOCTOR: Five or six years.
PATIENT: Uh-huh it was like 2005, 2006 somewhere around there.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] before you left Chicago, let’s see what they say.  [REDACTED] DVT.  When was your first heart attack?
PATIENT: 2007, no it was about 2006.
DOCTOR: 2006.
PATIENT: Cause I went to Christ Hospital.
DOCTOR: Just trying to see what they were thinking.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] where they put that dye in and it make you feel all weird.
DOCTOR: That's um that's probably the CT that they did, then you go through the circle.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's a CT.
PATIENT: No [REDACTED] solution makes you feel real warm and I feel all crazy and weird like and they asked me I [REDACTED] you know they put some more stuff and it's just like went away.  Makes my body real warm and then you got this you know.
DOCTOR: Did they put jelly in your chest too and stick like a probe on you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Did they put EKG leads on you?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] IV, whatever this stuff was.
DOCTOR: That's weird.
PATIENT: Yeah it was, it made me feel weird too.  Like you know, like my temperature was like on fire [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah that's the stress test that they did.
PATIENT: Right.  Well I did that at Holy Cross not here.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: That's what I'm telling you, you weren't listening DOCTOR.  I said it was at Holy Cross.
DOCTOR: But I'm seeing that uh you had like a stress test done in 2006 over here, that's what I was seeing.

DOCTOR: That was ’05. There we go, here you are.  Oh wait a minute.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] Something going on.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Oh now I'm picking it up.  Okay.  That is weird. With the swelling in your legs, it's a common practice to do an echo of the heart, because it’s one thing that could cause them to do an echo of your heart.  You could have swelling in your legs just because, also you had these DVTs in your legs.  Once you have a DVT if goes down into the veins of your legs and that kind of set it off.
PATIENT: Oh I think I can get a note for the other surgeries [REDACTED] in Kentucky a venous [REDACTED] or vein stripping.
DOCTOR: Where?
PATIENT: Of my legs.
DOCTOR: Both?
PATIENT: No just the left leg.
DOCTOR: You have.
PATIENT: Venous exposure and vein stripping.
DOCTOR: Why.

PATIENT: I [REDACTED] girlfriend [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: I was having some discomfort in my chest so I went up there.  They decided to admit me. They gave me everything, a stress test, EKG, all those other things and they said it was more blockage and I said well you know let me think about that for a minute so I came in and got you know another opinion on things to see what you guys since this will be my - I'll be going to.  I only stopped there because I was in the neighborhood and um I don't know they you know saw me.
DOCTOR: You said they had, they thought you had a 99% blockage?
PATIENT: No that was when I had the first heart attack.
DOCTOR: Okay how long ago was that?
PATIENT: April of this year.

DOCTOR: They stented you?  So you did had a stent put in.

DOCTOR: Over stents over those okay and then you left.  Did they say your arteries were open, did they say it was good?
PATIENT: They said follow up with my doctors here.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um so that was in April and so you came back here and then uh and then you were okay until this episode where you had eaten the spicy food?
PATIENT: Yes.

PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Anyone checking your blood level with that Warfarin?
PATIENT: Yeah the other day.
DOCTOR: The last one was 1.18 but its low so he's on double strength.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  So alright wow.  So they felt that the 99% was before they stented you in Springfield okay that's good to know and then when you came in to Holy Cross they did a stress test.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What kind of stress test was it?
PATIENT: The one with the injection.
DOCTOR: Okay so they injected you and what'd they say was going on?  What'd they say was the result of that?
PATIENT: They said there was more blockage.
DOCTOR: More blockage and what did they want to do?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] would have to do another surgery.
DOCTOR: Stent, did they want to put in another stent, did they say what they wanted to do?
PATIENT: I didn't have one, they said they wanted to do surgery but I told them no, I’m going going that way, you know.
DOCTOR: Did they talk about a surgery or a stent?
DOCTOR: A stent.  Were they going to do a surgery or a cath?
PATIENT: The one where the go through the groin.
DOCTOR: They're going to go through the groin.  They weren't talking about cutting your chest.
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Okay they're going through the groin and that's when you left.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay so they felt it was something they needed to do.  Um and then for the last week you haven't had any.
PATIENT: Well just uh, [REDACTED] eating [REDACTED] not really maybe gas, I’m not eating the right foods, it seemed like but I could be wrong but it doesn't feel like when I had the serious blockage down in the Springfield [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It felt right.  Have you been doing anything like where your heart beats faster like walking upstairs or anything like, what have you been doing in the last week, do you have to walk up any stairs, anything like that?
PATIENT: No.  You know oh [REDACTED] more sometimes and I'll be walking more.
DOCTOR: Just walking on flat ground.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Have you done anything in the last week where you would have to uh, where your heart would have to pound, beat harder, no stairs.  What about your apartment?  Are you on the first floor, elevator?
PATIENT: First floor.
DOCTOR: First floor okay.  Um right.  Alright I'm going to figure out what to do for this gentleman.  Um you know, obviously we’re not seeing any of the test results we're just hearing it from you so we got to figure out and you know really we know, we know that the big picture is we need to get some of those test results or repeat them ourselves um and then we have to figure out what the right thing is for you, you know treatment wise and the other thing we have to decide on is how dangerous is the situation really is.  Do we need to um you know do all this today or can we wait um and you know it's a little hard to say.  You've been doing okay for the last week um but we don't want anything bad to happen.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] with the heart is I know when it’s time @@.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] right.
PATIENT: Cause like now I feel fine.
DOCTOR: You feel fine.
PATIENT: And I know if I been you know when it get to the point where it's not right, I know to dial 911, you guys come get me to the hospital [REDACTED] like something's really going on.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: The problem down in Springfield, I couldn't really you know and they told me, you know I couldn't stand up straight.  I knew that something was really going on wrong there and I went to the hospital and I, like I say I had surgery.
DOCTOR: When you were at Holy Cross last, how long was that now, it's been uh.
PATIENT: About two weeks.
DOCTOR: Two weeks alright.  When you were at Holy Cross um how bad did they say it was?
PATIENT: They, okay they said they did find a small blockage.
DOCTOR: Small blockage.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And they wanted to go in there again and put in like more stents or something?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But you did not have a heart attack the second time.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: There was no heart attack when you were there.
PATIENT: No. Blockage.
DOCTOR: Blockage.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I had a heart attack.
DOCTOR: Right, right, and this was more of a blockage.  Um so we had no, I'm trying to figure out one option is that we could call the surgery fellow now.  We probably should [REDACTED] surgery I mean the Cardiology fellow.  I think what we should do is call the Cardiology fellow now and ask them what they recommend we do cause I want to make sure we get this right.  You know on the one hand he knows his body well and he's saying that you know he's okay now.  On the other hand the problem is sometimes you know you can get a sudden blood clot in a narrow vessel and that can be deadly, like with no warning and we don't want that to happen to you.
PATIENT: Right I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well yeah kind of like an embolism or it could be just, an embolism or it could be just a piece of um tissue inside the artery basically just breaks away and can cause a blockage and that can happen in people with heart disease which is why sometimes people die suddenly.  Um it's unlikely to happen but um.
PATIENT: It can.
DOCTOR: It can and uh so I want to talk to the cardiologist today before and get his input. Do you want to page our fellow and get his input?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We've got a pretty good idea, pretty good information now and we can say that you know he was initially treated for an MI in Springfield, that he was stented at that time.  He had a 99% lesion when he came in, he came back two weeks ago with a no MI at Holy Cross but with um evidence of you know some partial blockage um that now has been okay for a week, no symptoms um but uh we kind of want to get their advice of whether we need to do something today or whether we can have him come in for testing and also the question becomes, it would be nice to get the results from Holy Cross.  We're gonna want those results soon to get those sent over here and we could have him sign a release here.
PATIENT: I did that already.
DOCTOR: Oh good.
PATIENT: We did all that.
DOCTOR: The pharmacist [REDACTED]
PATIENT: The forms, yeah I did all those things.  I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You had a heart attack you said in April?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Right now you don’t have [REDACTED] therapy.
DOCTOR: Right, essentially you need to be on.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay so we can also ask.  So why don't you call um, do you have another patient waiting or are you okay?
DOCTOR: No actually I think I'm okay.
DOCTOR: Good.  I want you to call the cardiologist.  So I want you to sit tight, let us call the cardiologist now and make sure we get this right.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll get on that right away.
PATIENT: Are you still a student or are you a you know?
DOCTOR: No I am a doctor. But I’m a first year, but he’s an attending [REDACTED] top dog.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I’ll bet you got some bills.
DOCTOR: What’s that?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I’ll bet you got some school bills, don’t you?
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I know you do, you still need to work.  It'll pay off though.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: About ten years.
DOCTOR: Yeah give or take.
PATIENT: Then you can go just living [REDACTED] like the rest of the doctors.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And [REDACTED] I'll take it.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] has it right.
PATIENT: Sure can't take it with you.  And once you know you pass in this life [REDACTED] it's all paid for.  How about that?
DOCTOR: I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  97:51  DOCTOR IN:  111:13)
DOCTOR: Hey how you doing.  Hi, so we talked to Cardiology.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Talked to the Pharmacy.  Did a lot of talking.  So basically we're going to start you on two new meds. Number one is called Plavix.  Were you on Plavix for a month?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So but you have two stents, alright so you'll have a stent put over the other stent okay so the cardiologist thought that you should be on Plavix for longer. So we'll put you on Plavix until um until you can be seen.
PATIENT: And you want me on Plavix, [REDACTED] injections and Coumadin.
DOCTOR: Yeah. But you know they work differently.  The Plavix works on platelets, the Coumadin kind of works on the blood, [REDACTED] blood is.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] injections work on what?.
DOCTOR: They work on helping your blood.  The Coumadin actually works on the same thing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So let's see.
PATIENT: So when do I have to come back.
DOCTOR: Uh we are trying to get you into Cardiology within the next week or two.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you're going to come to see me within a month.
