PATIENT: In my personal life, so just, argh, uh but uh I quit uh for a week and then, a little over a week ago but right now I'm at the point where I've started back up but I'm cutting it down, I want to quit again, so.  Again, but they say it takes sometimes, it takes three times.
DOCTOR: I understand that yeah.
PATIENT: Oh I been smoking for 47 years.
DOCTOR: It's a bad habit.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Yeah. It’s real hard.  But I go to church all the time now.  I'm a born again Christian and I'm praying and everything.  I think I'm gonna make it hopefully.
DOCTOR: Let's see um.  I think I went up on your cholesterol medicine.
PATIENT: Uh I was gonna, I quit taking it.
DOCTOR: Oh why?
PATIENT: It seems like I was getting pains and uh the doctor uh, what's her name uh the chief doctor, what's her name?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She changed the medication because I was feeling pain from the other one.
DOCTOR: Let's see which doctor?
PATIENT: What's her name right here?
DOCTOR: DOCTOR?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me see if she wrote a note on that.  She changed it to pravastatin okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I was getting pains again.  I've been pain a lot in the right shoulder.  I get pain in my shoulder.  [REDACTED] get a cortisone shot every three months.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh it seem like it just made it worse, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I quit and the shoulder felt a little better.
DOCTOR: So is the pain in your shoulder or pain in the muscles?
PATIENT: It's hard to tell the difference.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Did you have pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No. The shoulder and right in this area. Seems like It was in the muscle too and uh I quit taking it.  I'm overdue for my steroid shot but their backlogged up there so what I was -  you know, doing myself was that I got an appointment for up there but it's late cause they're stacked up.  I wanted to get my shot once again and then start taking that medication again and see if there is a difference because it was like I couldn’t move my arm hardly.  I still have problems but [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Is it a sharp pain when you move your arm?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: And if you're not moving it, how is it, is it better?
PATIENT: I'm okay right now but if I move it.
DOCTOR: It's, I mean keep going.
PATIENT: You can hear it snap at times.
DOCTOR: When you were on the medicine for your cholesterol was it bad when you were moving?
PATIENT: It was bad when I wasn't moving nowhere.  If I remember correctly.  I got so many things in my mind that I try to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No, no I understand, no that's fine.  Um.  Do you know when you have an appointment for that?
PATIENT: Uh next month, I'm not sure exactly of the date.  I've got it at home but I got it next month.
DOCTOR: Cause I think.
PATIENT: Probably within the month.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  The way you talk, it makes me think its degenerative change problems, [REDACTED] I’m trying to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm gonna give [REDACTED] more.
DOCTOR: Okay, [REDACTED] what the ultimate problem is.  Because you know how well, you know shoulder joints work for a while oh I mean injections work but they're temporary measures.  They don't uh.
PATIENT: Well I just, I just, you can hear it popping.
DOCTOR: Oh I know.
PATIENT: And I'm just wondering if maybe my shoulder is uh.
DOCTOR: Have you done physical therapy?
PATIENT: I like the physical therapy for a while but not actually for my shoulder for my back I mean.
DOCTOR: But let's see.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh because what I'm saying a lot of times one of the best ways of getting things better is working on things around that joint.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Getting the muscle either more loose and strengthens around the joint.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: That not only helps the joint but it helps to support the structures.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And a lot of times you'll see improvement that way.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I was at physical therapy.
DOCTOR: Good.  Way back in 2010 right, was that when it was 2010?
PATIENT: I can't remember.  Sometimes I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Have you [REDACTED] rotator cuff?
PATIENT: No but I.
DOCTOR: Ever have an MRI for your shoulder?
PATIENT: No.  I just had an MRI on my brain you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah let me make sure.
PATIENT: Which was cool.  [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Oh I was looking at your x-rays; you've got a bony spur in there.
PATIENT: I think I got to discuss this with them a little bit further this time.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because you know I think I tore my rotator cuff a long time ago and uh I don't know what's wrong with it now.  Just like came on all of a sudden and it snaps and pops.  I sometimes, I have a feeling; I got to ask them, if it's dislocated or something.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah it's probably not dislocated.  You'd really know it if it was dislocated.
PATIENT: Oh I'm telling you at times I really feel it.
DOCTOR: Where, we'll take a look.  I mean it would look like this.  You’d look in the mirror and see that you don’t look symmetrical.
PATIENT: Oh okay.  Alright.
DOCTOR: That's [REDACTED] obvious.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.  Then it ain’t dislocated but sometimes I get a real bad pain and if I move it suddenly I get a sharp pain like ah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Like I said I'm gonna talk to them more.  I guess that's what they specialize in so.
DOCTOR: Yeah they do that all the time.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Let's see, [REDACTED].  They weren't gonna to do a colonoscopy for you but it looks like we're gonna do maybe the blood tests for your stool.
PATIENT: Right, you know what.
DOCTOR: Did you pick those up, or, it looks like it.
PATIENT: Well I did pick them up.
DOCTOR: Okay so you did get them.
PATIENT: But I misplaced it. I lost it.
DOCTOR: Yeah we'll [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay.  Yeah I was gonna ask you about that. [REDACTED].  And I wanted to ask uh.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh DOCTOR sent me for an x-ray on my spine. I wondered because  in order to get service-connected disability with my back.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh I don't know if it's the muscles or the disability.  Sometimes I see these doctors and then I forgot what they said.  All I know is this spot is something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But uh.  I was at Mercy Hospital before I started coming to the VA.  I think I had one of the spine and I got arthritis or some kind of thing [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Let's see, I see.  Wait a second.  All I see is um a CT of, essentially right here from November 2010.  Did you get anything; you got something done somewhere else?
PATIENT: Uh no, nowhere else.
s
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well we have some [REDACTED] six months ago.  They did a CT of your neck and it showed some degenerative changes.

PATIENT: But now I didn't have the spine x-ray at Hines, I believe that was here.
DOCTOR: Okay. So let's see.
PATIENT: It's [REDACTED] brain [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Here we go. There you go, wait, what?  They did an MRI of your brain?
PATIENT: I had uh yes.
DOCTOR: What was the ultimate reason for?
PATIENT: Well it started out uh a while back, I think two doctors ago.  Some guy thought I might have been having a heart attack cause my left eye went numb.  Instead they sent me, they checked me out and no heart attack but they sent me for a CAT scan and uh but that's gone, I don't know I guess it came out okay.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And she wanted to send me, she thought that maybe I might have had a stroke, or whatever, so she scheduled me for an MRI, I couldn't do it because I'm claustrophobic. I tried.  They outsourced me even and they [REDACTED] and this time they gave me some medication and I went to Hines and I did it and everything was alright except they said that I got an enlarged blood vessel but it's not a, oh what do you call uh, uh.
DOCTOR: Not like an aneurysm.
PATIENT: Right they said it wasn't an aneurysm.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And she said uh that my sinuses, I got an infection in my sinuses.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] can also see.
PATIENT: So.  And I was just happy it wasn't a stroke or whatever.  But she didn't say about the medication.  I only took two pills and the nasal spray.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I take them it seems like my nose just keeps running and running and running.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I stopped that too and my nose doesn't run and uh.  When I joined the service uh they said I had postnasal drip that could kill a horse. Their exact words.  But it runs in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah I'll be honest with you, there are a couple of things which really help that, might make a difference [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: It's very painful.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I understand the risks I'm taking.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But uh if it comes down to you know.
DOCTOR: Well right now you have a lot of pain uh is it only when you do certain things?
PATIENT: When I do certain things.
DOCTOR: Okay when you take the pills, even at rest you're in pain is that correct?
PATIENT: Uh most of the time it seems yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: But I'm going to find out myself.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause I'm going to see that doctor again.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And I'm going to get a shot, hopefully I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm gonna talk to him and after that I will resume taking that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause I may have to find out for myself.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  Um there's a couple of other statins that if that is the problem we can try another statin.  [REDACTED] problems with all of them unfortunately.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Um and now we, have you decided about it, you remember that we.
PATIENT: Yeah we were going to discuss that, do you remember, we haven't discussed that.
DOCTOR: Well I filled in the form they said.
PATIENT: I know and I told you we'll talk about that next time I come in.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's why I'm here to talk to you.
PATIENT: Yeah okay, we're talking.  What is it?
DOCTOR: So this is one of the veins seemed a little bit enlarged in the head um one of the veins.  Now we all have um.
PATIENT: Right, right, right.
DOCTOR: Sinuses.
PATIENT: Now what is this thing called?
DOCTOR: It’s like an MRI.  It's called MRE, which is the same thing as having [REDACTED] inject you with the die.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's a different kind of picture exactly.
PATIENT: It's the same thing basically as a MRI.
DOCTOR: MRI.
PATIENT: Wonderful.
DOCTOR: Can you go [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: What if I don't I mean, what's the?
DOCTOR: Well um the thing is um you know we just want to make sure it's not like an aneurysm.  Oh [REDACTED] um.
PATIENT: I thought you said it wasn't.
DOCTOR: It's not an aneurysm because it's not coming from the artery [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well it already showed that it's enlarged.  I mean what difference does it make of having it done or not?  MRE or V or whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Uh no [REDACTED].  Um.
PATIENT: It just seems like I've been getting a whole lot of x-rays and stuff you know.  I shut out the light here and we can still see you know.
DOCTOR: No, no.
PATIENT: Cause I glow in the dark.
DOCTOR: The thing is sometimes the [REDACTED] get thrombosed, you know they can [REDACTED] you know they get enlarged and they're bigger than usual and then blood tends to thicken there and they can form clots and then you end up with a different set of problems and [REDACTED] end up being on blood thinners long-term.
PATIENT: Okay and uh.
DOCTOR: And uh it could potentially cause a stroke because.
PATIENT: Okay, what if I get the MRE and what is it going to show different?
DOCTOR: So if it does show that you have uh a enlarged vein.
PATIENT: Okay then what do you do?
DOCTOR: Unless you have thrombosis, more blood clots, we leave it alone and then [REDACTED] blood clot then you have to be on blood thinners.
PATIENT: Oh boy.  It seems like I get a lot of x-rays and stuff.  They all don’t seem necessary.
DOCTOR: You know the problem is unfortunately [REDACTED] right now, [REDACTED] we have to follow up on it because now there is something [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  One test uh, I just tested for that one thing.
DOCTOR: And they found something else.
PATIENT: And the test shows up something different and then when it shows up something different I get a test for that and that shows up something different.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And it's going on and on and on.
DOCTOR: I know.  It's because [REDACTED] so intense, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: When do we finally say okay that's enough?
DOCTOR: Uh we yeah the patient dies or when he says no I don't want it [REDACTED] because from our side of view we had to offer it and.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just so we can get some answers.  So.
PATIENT: Where do I have this at?  Hines again?
DOCTOR: At Hines again.
PATIENT: And it's the same thing huh?
DOCTOR: They do the same thing.  They just to a focus on the veins this time, not on the.
PATIENT: Is it the same machine, very same?
DOCTOR: The same machine yeah that's right [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I think they injected me the last time didn't they?
DOCTOR: Yeah that was, the same [REDACTED].  I think most likely they do.
PATIENT: I don't care if I'm injected it's just so many x-rays.
DOCTOR: Maybe this one is the last one that's done [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: Uh we'll give you the number.  You'll call and set it up.  But this time you have to go to Hines because um.
