DOCTOR: If we can increase the glipizide, I don’t know if we can, but would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: With what?

PATIENT: The blood pressure's go high and the blood pressures go down, blood pressures go down, blood pressure was 252 and it went down right now to 179, 160, 149.
DOCTOR: Yeah but that's still too high.
PATIENT: 139, you want it 120 right?
DOCTOR: Yeah I do.
PATIENT: Yep, 120.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s work on your diabetes first, that's the main thing.
PATIENT: Sometimes it goes down; blood pressure goes down, goes up and goes down.
DOCTOR: Alright, we're gonna see you back in a month.  If your blood sugar is still too high.

PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Hmm, what can they do for the blood sugars?
DOCTOR: That's what I'm saying.  We could either increase, I don't know I have to check if I can increase your glipizide but I think you might be on the maximum dose and then we would have to add insulin.
PATIENT: Maximum dose of what?
DOCTOR: The glipizide, the 10 mg.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] diabetes, I be taking the glipizide, I'm taking enough glipizide.
DOCTOR: Well for some people that's enough but for you it’s not.  Your diabetes is more severe.
