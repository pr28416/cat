[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well tell me about the urinating, what's going on with that?
PATIENT: Yeah well uh I stopped taking, I stopped taking the terazosin.
DOCTOR: Why?
PATIENT: Because I thought it was affecting my urine.  My urine pattern.  So when I stopped taking terazosin my urine got worse but I didn't take the terazosin because I thought the terazosin was causing me to get up three times a night.
DOCTOR: It should be causing you to get up less and maybe letting you get up three instead of six.
PATIENT: Oh yeah?
DOCTOR: When did you stop it?
PATIENT: I stopped it maybe about a month ago.
