DOCTOR: Nice to see you.
PATIENT: How you been?
DOCTOR: Good, how are you?  Take a seat.
PATIENT: Thanks.
DOCTOR: How was your holiday?
PATIENT: Uh uneventful which is good.
DOCTOR: Um how have you been, anything new going on, anything different?
PATIENT: Uh no.  Uh, probably just a little cold and uh, so I just had to use some medicine and you know I get rid of the phlegm and pretty much.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] nothing new [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How about uh the Waldenstrom stuff is that all on the back burner?
PATIENT: Uh well, I'm being monitored uh I haven't uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I had, I went over there to get my port [REDACTED] uh get the labs from them cause they did the labs so they should be coming through.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm looking at them now.  They're pretty good.  Nothing abnormal in the labs.
PATIENT: Okay.  Good.  Uh the one thing that I was wondering about and uh I think I talked to you last time over the phone is uh, uh, I went for a chiropractic um, I can't without my teeth I guess, I don't know I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But uh and I initiated that uh on my own because I was having trouble uh with my back sleeping and stuff like that so uh, that has been a burden to me uh but I was wondering am I in any way eligible for uh reimbursement for those uh.
DOCTOR: I don't think that the VA does anything with chiropractic services.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: What about physical therapy through the VA would you be interested in trying that?
PATIENT: Uh I don't know if that's the same thing?
DOCTOR: It's not but it's the best thing that they offer.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So what it would be is I would send you to see a physical rehabilitation doctor and he would do an exam on you.  He would figure out, you know you have certain limitations or certain weaknesses, he would send you to a therapist and they would help to work on strengthening those.  Um for a lot of people it's very helpful.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You could always go and see if you don't like it, you don't have to do it anymore.  You know it's not gonna, it's not going to bind you in to anything.
PATIENT: Alrighty.
DOCTOR: Uh, would you like me to, I could put in a consult so they would see you.
PATIENT: Okay that's fine.
DOCTOR: And then it's up to you know what time you want to do it but.
PATIENT: Yeah right now I'm two months into the chiropractor.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then again it's helped me out uh and I'm uh up tight you might say.
DOCTOR: All in the back?
PATIENT: Yeah, well I've got arthritis in the small back, small of the back anyway.  That was something that was uh found in an MRI or x-ray.
DOCTOR: Did you hurt your back at any point?
PATIENT: Years ago uh, as a bakery salesman I threw it out so it has been tender.
DOCTOR: I'm telling them what's wrong with you. (Doctor typing on keyboard)
PATIENT: But uh the x-ray or the MRI uh showed uh arthritis in the small of the back.
DOCTOR: Um do you know [REDACTED].  Okay that'd be for a colonoscopy [REDACTED].  Did you get your shots, it looks like you did.  You got your immunization on November 5th.
PATIENT: Yeah, 2002, I need a colonoscopy, that was the last time.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] follow-up.
PATIENT: So it's every ten years.
DOCTOR: Every ten years cause yours was negative.  Are you going to see the hematologist in the clinic, [REDACTED] where he is?
PATIENT: Uh I got [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh and that's gonna be coming up soon, I think it's the 8th.  The 6th or the 8th.
DOCTOR: Okay, DOCTOR is a good friend.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: She's a very nice girl.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We worked in med school together.
PATIENT: Oh great.
DOCTOR: I know her and her husband pretty well.  Alright you're also due for some blood work.  Now your due for a PSA check.  Your last PSA was elevated, so I'm going to put um.
PATIENT: I've got to be here Monday so I can do it then.
DOCTOR: Let's do it then.  Let's just do it then.
PATIENT: Would I go back to uh.
DOCTOR: Where you got it today.
PATIENT: In the, okay back to Oncology.
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no I didn't know that's what they're going to do; it's the first floor regular laboratory.
PATIENT: Hmm, first floor.
DOCTOR: Yeah I forgot, I forgot that you go upstairs to the special one.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And then uh your cholesterol is fantastic, you know a little bit, but not bad at all, I mean it's pretty good.  Well let's see what you got you.  But you take no medications right?
PATIENT: Nothing, no.  Other than Tylenol and Advil and stuff like that to help alleviate some of the unpleasantness of the back.
DOCTOR: Were you ever a smoker?
PATIENT: At one time yes I was.
DOCTOR: How long were you a smoker?
PATIENT: Uh, I'd say from about my 16th birthday to probably my 30th, probably about 15 years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: At least.
DOCTOR: But then you quit 30 years ago.
PATIENT: Yes, yeah but I had it and I wish I could have convinced my sister to do it.  She's got emphysema.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's when it gets tough.
PATIENT: I had an uncle that died from emphysema and I and believe me there's nothing worse than to go to reposition your uncle who was 6' 3" 250 pounds and then he's probably 90 pounds then and uh he tells you to get the hell out of the room.
DOCTOR: Oh I know it's hard.
PATIENT: Because that's what I was thinking you know.
DOCTOR: How is your mood?
PATIENT: Uh generally okay.  Uh I have uh problems being estranged from my uh family.
DOCTOR: I remember you told me about that.
PATIENT: Yeah and uh it's really.  I tried to investigate as many avenues as I can but it seems like nobody wants to withdraw the.
DOCTOR: Is there anyone in your family you still talk to?
PATIENT: Uh my mother and my two sisters no.  Uh I don't try to communicate with the cousin, who is now taking care of his mother.  I don't want to cause anybody any.
DOCTOR: More problems?
PATIENT: Yeah no, that's not what I want.  I wanted uh visitation rights to my mother and my sister denied me that.  She is my mother's caretaker.  I have two sisters and the one that's the caretaker is.
DOCTOR: But they live close by?
PATIENT: Uh, what my mother's house is in Chicago, I live in Overland Park.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So that's not really that far away.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].  Um every time you come in here, we need to look [REDACTED].  This time your blood pressure is a little elevated and have they ever tried you on blood pressure medications or ever talked to you about this?
PATIENT: Years ago.
DOCTOR: Yeah how did you tolerate those?
PATIENT: Uh, it was okay but since I went through the chemo and the plasmapheresis uh they took me off the blood pressure medications so now, I feel comfortable about it really.
DOCTOR: You feel you wish you had some or you don't want any?
PATIENT: No I don't really want any.
DOCTOR: Okay, well then we'll just pull them off.  Your blood pressure is not terrible but uh, we'll hold off for now and if it gets worse in the future we might have to reconsider.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything else looks good.  I mean your numbers are good.  Your labs are fantastic.  Your [REDACTED] seems to be very under control um.  There's not much else um.  You'll know we'll have [REDACTED] in the summer but there's not much else other than we'll get that toxic value checked tomorrow.
PATIENT: If you could, uh well you said and there's no chiropractic uh uh.
DOCTOR: It was a physical rehab guy, I put that one out.
PATIENT: Okay, we'll work towards that and see what happens there because uh I noticed that uh with uh the chiropractor there's two parts, one is muscle and one is bones and uh it seems to be uh working.  I mean I feel better, this is over two months.  Now I feel uh a lot more comfortable.  I still ache in the morning when I get up but.
DOCTOR: They might be able; the rehab doctor might be able to help you with that.  That's what their whole area is.  I know you prefer seeing a chiropractor but they're very good with specific exercises and stretching to help out bones and muscle pains.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we're gonna get you in to see them and see what they have to offer but I think that that would be helpful to you as well.
PATIENT: Okay and uh I just worry about the other things, uh the vision as far as at the Waldenstrom.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And also I still have the tinnitus in my ears and uh the one ear is particularly deaf but uh the tinnitus it bothers me that it's going to be with me the rest of my life, I understand?
DOCTOR: I think some of those are side effects as part of the Waldenstrom spectrum.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] yeah.  Uh is Waldenstrom an organization or uh that has a track record and Waldenstrom patients uh they are more or less people that have it and go through it and what their experiences are?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Yeah I'll have to look.  I know DOCTOR might know that too because that's more of her area.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: But I [REDACTED].  Do you have access to a computer?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah I would check out the internet, if you type in Waldenstrom, I'm sure you'll find a group of people living with this.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: They kind of describe some of their symptoms and what they go through.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  I would like to be [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Up-to-date.
PATIENT: Yeah and prepare for, I live alone and I have to prepare for some sort of uh, uh long term uh care that I can provide for myself and have the foresight.
DOCTOR: To take care of that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, ask her.  I'll look through; I haven't really looked for it.  You're actually the only patient I've ever taken care of with Waldenstrom.
PATIENT: After all my life, to finally become unique.  There's only about 300 million a year but.
DOCTOR: Right.  I don't know anybody else like you.
PATIENT: Well, actually thank you (laughter).
DOCTOR: Well let me talk to my boss and I'll be right back and we'll take a listen to you.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back, relax.

DOCTOR: Okay, I'll take a peek, I'll take a listen to you and then I think we can do six months.  Um, you'll probably see DOCTOR in the meantime.
PATIENT: Right.  Uh that's next week.
DOCTOR: Oh fantastic.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Everything will [REDACTED].

PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: There you go.  Oh you got your warm pants on underneath [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: Big breath.  Good.  Good.  Take a listen now.  [REDACTED].  Any trouble going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No pains, change in your stool, dark stool, light stool?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Nothing like that.  Uh, I forget did we, let me check my notes cause.  Um you're due for your once a year rectal exam, are you okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, is it up to you.
DOCTOR: It's just the digital one where I check the size of your prostate.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's up to you. Uh we can do just the blood test and if the blood test is elevated then we can talk about further testing.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Would you prefer to do it that way?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, so otherwise I'm gonna take you over to see the nurse and then I'm gonna have you come see me in six months.  Uh I'll talk to DOCTOR and let her know about what's kind of going on and then she, we'll kind of communicate back and forth uh but otherwise everything looks pretty good.
PATIENT: Okay.
