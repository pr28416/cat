PATIENT: Yeah.  Well then operation and they told me I had a lung problem and they go ahead and cut it out here and woke it up and woke it up. And I did not know it was there.  Yeah the last thing I know was that, cause [REDACTED] you got to ask her, I don't know, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And he said the lung back to 2003 [REDACTED] operate on the kidneys so we found out about this [REDACTED] liver to my lungs [REDACTED] straight to that bowel obstruction.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: When they were working, when they were trying to figure out what's going on with the pain down there?
PATIENT: They knew what was going on down there.  [REDACTED] he was glad to see me in [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He says no, no, you gonna do this and then what he did, he went on messing around with my, with my uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I've got to look here and see what they were talking about.
PATIENT: So my problem is once I got out of this, I thought I got out of this, I still, this side just a [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] a day got me a clip [REDACTED].  This one over here [REDACTED] sleep on it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And some of them.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: And what do you take for the pain now?
PATIENT: Uh let me find here, what is it?
SECOND PERSON O721
Dilaudid.  My husband is on Dilaudid.  His problem here today.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
It's I wanted him to come here to it's just that, I was hoping that ya'll would do a follow-up.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
On his electrolytes.  He had an electrolytes imbalance I think.
DOCTOR: That's because of the thyroid.
SECOND PERSON O721
His calcium, his phosphorus, everything is fine?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Well all his electrolytes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Plus his pain was not controlled okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Plus they are suspicious that he might have a hernia, that's why I'm here today and then the main reason why I wanted a follow-up appointment, which I had to beg for an appointment.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Is they still have not set up a [REDACTED] appointment.  They have not controlled the pain even though he has the Fentanyl patch.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
He has the Lidoderm patch and he's had Dilaudid, but his pain is not controlled and he has an anxiety medication that they are administering, but his pain is not controlled even though he's under Hospice [REDACTED].  Uh more than any problem it seems that his pain is out of control.  The new problem, the new secondary problem to his cancer.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Is this uh, I don't want to diagnosis, is this possible rule out a hernia.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
He has a knot that he did not have in December or January.  Now it's real prominent.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And when you do your um your examination.
DOCTOR: I need to take a look at it.
SECOND PERSON O721
When you examine him, I'm sure when you palpate, you will see it.  It's very prominent and we've been putting Lidoderm patches on it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And um and it's not you know, relieved or controlled you know with the Fentanyl patch or the Dilaudid.  Dilaudid is given every two hours.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
And the Fentanyl patch is every 72 hours.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And um this a lot of the patch is local with every 12 hours on, on for 12 hours, off for 12 hours but um that is not um.
DOCTOR: Where do you get the Lidoderm patch from cause I don't see it in here?
PATIENT: Uh that ones from.
SECOND PERSON O721
It's from his hospice doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh from the hospice doctor okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh-huh.  And um my husband is very uncomfortable he has a lot of abdominal pain and discomfort, it may be a possible hernia.  Uh we don't know what it is.
DOCTOR: And this has happened since December?
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh since January when we were discharged.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
But I mean, it was probably there all along but I mean it's probably growing larger to now to where it's like protruding out.  He's had two uh bowel obstruction surgeries, 2003, July 2003 the bowel obstruction surgery and then after that he had a lot of adhesions and another bowel obstruction surgery in 2011 July at the Little Company of Mary.
DOCTOR: July of 2011?
SECOND PERSON O721
2003 he had a bowel obstruction surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And also 2011 July, same month, bowel obstruction surgery with adhesions and they did something else in terms of repairing the bowel and he had a partial left nephrectomy in 2003 and that's what he was trying to say to you.
DOCTOR: That's what he was referring to okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
And also he was referring to he was first diagnosed with lung cancer in um 2003.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
But you know I wasn't present and he just didn't even, you know how guys are. He didn't think nothing of it when they were first talking about they saw some spots on his lungs.
DOCTOR: Right.
SECOND PERSON O721
But when they once they saw an obstruction was in July 2011 when he came in, when he became short of breath and they were suspicious of COPD.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And they was trying to, that's when they did the uh scans and all the x-rays and stuff that's when they saw the obstruction in the left lung and then when they did the CAT scan and all the other stuff that they did they came up with the lung uh CA and then they started staging it and they got the stage IV and they weren't able to proceed with the chemo, radiation at that time.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
So they went on with the palliative care and the Hospice care which has not brought him the comfort, that was one of the things it was supposed to do.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
But one of the things that has not happened, cause the pain is not controlled.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
And the new problem, I was going to let him express himself.
DOCTOR: Yeah, he seems to have some difficulty, but that's okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh they're not gonna see it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
I wanted him to tell you because this stuff is subjective.  I want him to tell you what's going on with him.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And he did and I'm just, I'm just his wife, Iâ€™m just saying what I assess is that his pain is not controlled.
DOCTOR: Sure.
SECOND PERSON O721
And if the medicine is given every two hours, [REDACTED] you know, take two or three pills every two hours.  Dilaudid is stronger than Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And that is that's [REDACTED] to me.
DOCTOR: What happens when he takes it, does he get like really knocked out or is he, does it seem to improve his pain or what happens when he takes the pills of the Dilaudid.
SECOND PERSON O721
What happens?
PATIENT: It knocks me out.
DOCTOR: It knocks out the pain?
PATIENT: Around 45 minutes, I don't know 50 uh [REDACTED] at 1:00 it's just about gone now [REDACTED].  Uh going on 45 minutes over and uh then it, you know I been going this long anyway.
SECOND PERSON O721
So one of the other problems that I assess is that we're gonna give him, he was taking Ativan.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
And um then they gave him an anti-anxiety medicine.
DOCTOR: Looks like they gave him Seroquel.
SECOND PERSON O721
And uh what is the other one, there's two of them?
DOCTOR: Olanzapine and Seroquel.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh olanzapine.  If he does not take the olanzapine.  He becomes very anxious, very, very anxious.
DOCTOR: And you have that at home or do you need more refills of it?
SECOND PERSON O721
But we need refills of that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
I didn't give him the um [REDACTED] the other one but the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh that's the Seroquel.
SECOND PERSON O721
The Seroquel.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's at night, that's the one at night.
SECOND PERSON O721
Right but.
PATIENT: But I need the hydrocodone, what is that one?
SECOND PERSON O721
Um this is the Dilaudid; I can't pronounce the other one.
PATIENT: Probenecid.
SECOND PERSON O721
He needs that but what.
DOCTOR: Well we could always go up to the patch too.  The patch is a low dose right now.
SECOND PERSON O721
Right it's 50.
DOCTOR: Right.
SECOND PERSON O721
It's at 50 and it's uh every uh every 17 hours.
DOCTOR: Can he stand up out of the chair?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] uh the patch.
DOCTOR: Are you able to get up here?
PATIENT: Huh?
SECOND PERSON O721
Well why is he so anxious because he's got pain control?
DOCTOR: Yeah, well yeah I mean.
SECOND PERSON O721
Um he gets real angry and he's real upset.
DOCTOR: That could be it definitely.
SECOND PERSON O721
Is the medicine every two hours?  Isn't that too much?
DOCTOR: Um I mean it is a lot but it's all about getting his pain under control.  I mean if it isn't enough then he might have to take more you know.
SECOND PERSON O721
So he takes, he could maybe take three pills every two hours.
DOCTOR: No, no, let me talk to my boss first and we'll decide what we're gonna do about, about the pain medications.  So he's also taking the, he's also taking the uh hydrocodone?
SECOND PERSON O721
[REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Yeah that's uh the Norco or the Vicodin.
SECOND PERSON O721
No.  No, no, no, no, no.  He's not taking Vicodin.
PATIENT: Right there.
SECOND PERSON O721
He's taking the Dilaudid.
DOCTOR: He's taking Dilaudid [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
Dilaudid and Fentanyl.
PATIENT: Yeah that's it.
DOCTOR: The Lidoderm, he's taking the Lidoderm.
SECOND PERSON O721
But he has to have the Ativan.
PATIENT: It only working two hours.
SECOND PERSON O721
The Ativan, what's this one pill called Zyprexa?
DOCTOR: Zyprexa um I think um I think that's the olanzapine.
SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah but he has to have the Ativan and he's just.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
So you think that we should take the um.
DOCTOR: Let me talk to my boss and see if we can give him Ativan um to ease the anxiety.  So and you guys talked about this with the hospice doctor, they don't want to give him Ativan or what's the problem?
SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah he gave the Ativan with the Zyprexa cause that's the only way he can face it or otherwise he's really anxious.
DOCTOR: So how come the hospice doctor isnâ€™t like giving him [REDACTED] meds.
SECOND PERSON O721
He's on Ativan, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
He's on Ativan and um Zyprexa.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh I have to give to him together, but weâ€™re not giving it at QHS we were giving it, I give it uh at least twice a day cause they only ordered it once a day for sleep at night but that's not the case well the new problem is anxiety I got to give it more than once a day.  I have to give Ativan and Zyprexa.  I didn't give the other pill at all because I didn't, the one that you gave, I didn't give that.
DOCTOR: Okay Seroquel.
SECOND PERSON O721
Seroquel.  Only thing I give is the Zyprexa and I give Ativan cause he was taking Ativan before he was admitted on Christmas to the VA Hospital.
DOCTOR: Did the Hospice run out or is he still getting that at home?
SECOND PERSON O721
What?
DOCTOR: The Hospice care?
SECOND PERSON O721
He's still getting the Hospice care.
DOCTOR: So how come these meds are not getting titrated up like the Fentanyl and other pain meds, how come they're not doing that as part of Hospice?
SECOND PERSON O721
Theyâ€™re doing theâ€¦
PATIENT: No she have a meeting.  She comes to uh work on me but we having an appointment on the same day she come to see me she's telling us to talk to the doctor and get the medication.
DOCTOR: That's what she said at home hospice, to talk to the doctor.
SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah because she didn't have uh.
PATIENT: Yeah when I see her whatever.
DOCTOR: Because of what?
SECOND PERSON O721
She doesn't know probably gonna control of it, you know the medicine.
DOCTOR: They [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721

DOCTOR: Okay so [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721

SECOND PERSON O721
But after that they'll follow up.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
They want to see what you gave him.  Yeah take that off so you can.  They want to see what ya'll are gonna do then I expect they'll follow up.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
What she's saying is rather than her to order more medicines to go up here.
PATIENT: Yeah uh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Rather than us oh the other problem we had is constipation which is from the.
PATIENT: Hold on mother; hold off one thing [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
See, he didnâ€™t want me [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Cause he has a real bad problem with constipation.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] you talk, the less he gonna hear.
SECOND PERSON O721
He, can you hear what I'm saying?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SECOND PERSON O721
[REDACTED] more than one [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] that be alright.
DOCTOR: Alright so where's the pain you're talking about, right where is it.
SECOND PERSON O721
Take it off, take it off so he can see the.  Lay down so he can.
PATIENT: See here, [REDACTED] it flat.
SECOND PERSON O721
If you lay down he'll see it.
DOCTOR: That?
PATIENT: Uh-huh, yeah it feels like the.
DOCTOR: Have a seat now.
PATIENT: Alright it come out and when I lay down.
DOCTOR: Just relax.
PATIENT: It usually goes away.
DOCTOR: Just relax.
PATIENT: Feel that, fat, feel it.  It's fat, it ain't water or nothing.  [REDACTED] me.
SECOND PERSON O721
Be still.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: That hurts a lot?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah it does feel like a hernia.
SECOND PERSON O721
That's I'm here for.
DOCTOR: Could be an abdominal wall hernia.
PATIENT: It would go [REDACTED] and hard cause I can feel it, feel it right there?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Right there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  That hurts?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that, that hurt  Then it worse [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Take some deep breaths in let me hear.  Alright I mean I think it is a hernia. I don't think that um because of his other illnesses that they're gonna want to do surgery on this but we can definitely just try to control the pain for it.
SECOND PERSON O721
He's not a good candidate for.
DOCTOR: For surgery.
SECOND PERSON O721
And I mean this is what I assess.
DOCTOR: Right.  He would not be I don't think.
SECOND PERSON O721
I mean for me cause he's had tremendous weight loss since November.  I mean I'm always in tears cause we have to deal with this.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Because uh he's so thin.  I mean I donâ€™t know what to do.
DOCTOR: Are you eating enough?  Like what's going on?
PATIENT: I eat [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No appetite?
PATIENT: No my diet is [REDACTED] you know so.
DOCTOR: Are you drinking Ensures and things like that?
PATIENT: Right.
SECOND PERSON O721
Hmm.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I wanted to see, you know I've been.
SECOND PERSON O721
He wanted to see how thin he is.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I don't see any ulcers here.
SECOND PERSON O721
It was bare skin where maybe it's [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh that healed up, yeah that healed up.
DOCTOR: That's healed up.
SECOND PERSON O721
Can I say something, why such a tremendous weight loss?
DOCTOR: Because of the cancer.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh.
DOCTOR: That's what happens.
SECOND PERSON O721
Well whatever you want done for him.  The reason why I insisted I come back to the VA, whatever he got in December for those nine days, he wasn't eaten nothing.  He wasn't drinking much but when he came in here and they gave him all the IV therapy and they gave all the stuff they gave him.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Whatever they gave him.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
They had him on, they gave him a different electrolytes, now he's eating cause they told me the tumor was, uh the calcium was low or high it was.
DOCTOR: High.
SECOND PERSON O721
High the phosphorus was low or everything was off balance.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
So how long does it last?
DOCTOR: Well it's gonna last indefinitely um because of the cancer because the cancer is still there.
SECOND PERSON O721
No I'm talking about him being able to eat.  He wasn't doing nothing till he came in here that's why I insisted on coming back here even though Hospice [REDACTED] at the house.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
He wasn't making any progress until he came here and had the.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
Do you know what I'm saying I think there?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Well we'll check the labs and see if everything's okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.  Can he go back to where he was in December?
DOCTOR: Well you know eventually we would expect that because the cancer is progressing he's not being treated so we would expect for that to happen.  The question is we don't know how long that will take for that to happen cause no one can know.  No cancer doctors, nobody can know.
SECOND PERSON O721
Well he wasn't eating until he came here.
DOCTOR: But now he's eating again right?
PATIENT: I don't gain no weight now.
SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah, well why can't you [REDACTED] terrible to me.
PATIENT: That's all the exam, what we talking about now, what we gonna do about the pain pills, about the pain?
DOCTOR: Let me talk with my boss okay and we'll figure it out.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh do you want to look.  You see how [REDACTED] once a month or something.
DOCTOR: I donâ€™t see a problem with that.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh you want this to go all the way down again?
DOCTOR: Yeah because now his calcium is low it looks like.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh it is hmm.
PATIENT: What's that now?
SECOND PERSON O721
I don't know nothing about it, I just put the book down I was trying to read, I stopped trying to be [REDACTED], I'm just a basket case [REDACTED] so I don't know.  I mean to me I don't know why you think Hospice is so hot.  You don't have a doctor when you have Hospice.  All of a sudden somebody's coming and giving you medicine but if they came in, so there's no trial stuff that he can get into no, you don't know.
DOCTOR: No. That's what, that's what would have been assessed in the Oncology appointment you had back like in August.
SECOND PERSON O721
Well we had, August 30th, I asked for a follow-up and they said he didn't need one so then the last hospitalization here at the VA I asked, I asked to speak with Oncology so I'm coming here this Thursday.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
I'm going to Oncology; this is because I asked for this.  I want to find out if it's something that they could do.  Cause I don't hold the Hospice philosophy.  Do you hear what I'm saying?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
Of comfort palliative care, I'm still hoping for a stage V which would offer something that ya'll have not been able to offer but whatever ya'll done for him in December I want to do over.  They told me to make sure I give the magnesium and the phosphorus so is that keeping up his appetite up and everything, you don't know?
DOCTOR: Yeah it sometimes can really affect that I mean it just keeps, it just keeps it replenished you know in the setting of not eating.  If he's eating better, let me talk to my boss and we'll see what we can do.  We can check his labs and things like that and see if we find anything.  I mean give him something for the constipation, get him something better for pain.
SECOND PERSON O721
Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
What do you think the problem is?
PATIENT: But I got uh a suppositories that they sent me.
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: What's that?
SECOND PERSON O721
Suppositories.
DOCTOR: Suppositories okay.
PATIENT: We have them, [REDACTED] and it's actually every day, every day, it doesn't and I ain't got no power to pull my urine, my bowel movement out.  The only thing to do it is just.
DOCTOR: We can give you something stronger definitely.
SECOND PERSON O721
Well what could you do for the hernia, you don't know?
DOCTOR: For the hernia the only thing that we could do right now is pain control, trying to get the pain under better control and to stimulate the bowel movements.
SECOND PERSON O721
They can't do no lasers or nothing?
DOCTOR: I mean we can refer to Surgery but because of all these other illnesses I seriously doubt if they would do surgery on him.
SECOND PERSON O721
They wouldn't do a CT scan or anything like that?
DOCTOR: They wouldn't do it because, what would they do if they find something.  If you have a hernia they're not going to do a surgery because he's a palliative patient.
SECOND PERSON O721
Alright.
DOCTOR: Does that make sense?  Do you understand why?
SECOND PERSON O721
I understand.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah I understand.  Actually [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah why is that, I mean why?
DOCTOR: Because of the risk of doing a surgery in you, which is also going on in your body, the complication rate would be too high.  But if you want we can send you to the surgeons to talk with them about it if that's what you want.
SECOND PERSON O721
He's a high risk?
DOCTOR: Yes because of his cancer.
PATIENT: High risk of what?
DOCTOR: Of the complications of something bad happening.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] or something?
DOCTOR: No that if they try to repair the hernia that you would end up being in the hospital on a ventilator for the rest of your life basically.  Just because of a hernia which would really drastically um, it would basically drastically mess up his, um quality of life.
PATIENT: You can't give me, so the doctor say you give me some [REDACTED] pills then.
SECOND PERSON O721
So he his abdominal discomfort and pain, but he has not complained of chest pain.  Oh we forgot to tell him, he has a cough now, a productive cough.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And he has green sputum that he's coughing up.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Is that from the lungs?
DOCTOR: Probably.  It's coming from the lung cancer.
SECOND PERSON O721
He's never had that before.
DOCTOR: I mean it's probably from the worsening, from the lung cancer taking its course.
SECOND PERSON O721
But his um oxygen stuff is.
DOCTOR: He's doing okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
It's okay but he's very confused, gets very anxious and if ya'll can't do laser nothing, I mean you have so much modern stuff.
DOCTOR: Let me talk to my boss and then I'll come back and see what she thinks okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Alright.
DOCTOR: I'll ask her and see what she thinks okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back.
(DOCTOR OUT:  49:12  DOCTOR IN:  62:45)
DOCTOR: Hi there.  Hi PATIENT how are you?
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Hi PATIENT I'm DOCTOR.  I don't think we've met before.  I'm one of the medicine doctors here.  I'm working with DOCTOR and he, I went over the medical records with him um a little bit so I kind of have been a little more familiarized with um PATIENT's health condition.  I know that a lot of things have been concerning you, one being he's in a lot of pain from the hernia um or what seems to be a hernia and you're just wanting follow up from his recent hospitalization is that right?
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh somewhat.
PATIENT: Yes, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so when you, I know that Oncology and you know different services have talked to you both about Hospice.  What does Hospice mean for you?  Cause you know I want to know what exactly are the appropriate management points we need to focus on.  Some people are really only focused on being comfortable at home.  Other people want more done.  So what are, what did you all discuss with your Oncology doctors about Hospice?
SECOND PERSON O721
[REDACTED] to.
PATIENT: Yeah I think [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And I noticed that you donâ€™t have diabetes or blood pressure, those things have all been stopped, really it's just pain medicine right now.
PATIENT: Yeah, I have this thing.
DOCTOR: That's really causing you a lot of pain?
PATIENT: Yeah I be alright; it's just that I was doing fine, this right here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: This here, this is going back and forth, back and forth, as long as it's back and forth and pain.
DOCTOR: Yeah let me see here.
PATIENT: Feel it?
DOCTOR: Yeah right in here.
PATIENT: Hurts.  Along with this, right there yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Have you had recent imaging of his abdomen?  So yeah the question would be the only way to repair those, if it is in fact a hernia which it appears to be, is the surgical approach.  I don't know that they're gonna want to do anything surgically um.
SECOND PERSON O721
What [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Huh?
SECOND PERSON O721
What [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: I don't know.  I mean it could just be pain medication cause right now.
SECOND PERSON O721
When you say they you know I want you to identify they.
DOCTOR: Anybody, anyone, I don't know that anyone would operate because he's a very high risk um of not doing well.
SECOND PERSON O721
What would make him be um high risk?
DOCTOR: Being a stage IV cancer patient he's a high risk.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.  What Iâ€™m saying to you is that he's very, very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, I want you to ask.
SECOND PERSON O721
He can express himself.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
Because he's the patient and I can't express his subjective feelings.  Now I can tell you what I think.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
As his caretaker.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And his wife and living with him consistently during his whole experience.
DOCTOR: No I understand, I know what you mean.
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh illness.  No I'm gonna tell you what I think.  I think that his pain is not controlled.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
I think that um.
DOCTOR: Hold on second, Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m listening, Iâ€™m just trying to read his last scan.
SECOND PERSON O721
See when he left the hospital he did not have uh this problem that he's got now so would you think it would be reasonable for him to have another scan?
DOCTOR: He's probably gonna need some kind of imaging if this is new.
SECOND PERSON O721
This is new; this is what I'm trying to tell you.  While he was hospitalized on December 25th to January the 2nd or something.  I think he was here until January 2nd, uh he did not have a problem that I am and that he is expressing you.
DOCTOR: With the left belly pain.
SECOND PERSON O721
Right.  Left abdominal pain.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
He didn't have the hernia.  It wasn't as large and protruding as it is now.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Or I would've said something and he would've said something.  I try to allow him to, he's the patient, I'm just somebody that's in the family.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
I'm just his wife.  I don't have his pain, that's why I want him to express himself.
DOCTOR: Usually the patients are pretty good [REDACTED].  I'm sorry I clicked it off.
SECOND PERSON O721
So I'll stop talking so ya'll.
DOCTOR: Well you know, it sounds like, when did you last see your cancer doctors, out of curiosity, because the last note I could find was August.  Has it been that long?
SECOND PERSON O721
And while we were in the hospital, the last time we saw Oncology cancer people.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Was August @@, [REDACTED]@.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
We had one appointment, we talked to someone that pulled up the computer and told us the results.  Can you hear me with all that rattling?
DOCTOR: No I can hear you, go ahead I'm listening.
SECOND PERSON O721
So on August the 30th she didn't examine my husband.  All that she did was told him the results.  She had never seen him before.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
The PET scan.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
That was done at VA Jesse Brown Hospital.  She told him the results of the PET scan, where the cancer, how it was staged and how it had mets spread and to what areas of the body as to what, ribs and bones and so with that and I asked could I have a follow-up appointment with Surgery, would that be curative, and she said no.  I asked if we'd have chemotherapy and she said no.  I asked if we'd have radiation therapy.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
And she said no and then my husband asked her.
DOCTOR: Cause it didn't help yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
My husband asked her if he could have surgery in terms of removing the tumor and she said it was 3.2 it was located so close to his heart that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh it would be very dangerous.
DOCTOR: Yeah I saw that.
SECOND PERSON O721
And then he asked her again.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
I'm trying to tell you what happened.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I have read all of this already yeah.  I did read it yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay I'm trying to tell you what happened.  He asked her again how we don't understand.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
Could they surgically remove the um tumor.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And she said that uh they couldn't because of the location of the tumor.
DOCTOR: Right uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
So then while he was hospitalized, Iâ€™m getting so long-winded, while he was here from December 25th to January 2nd, I asked them if we could talk with Oncology.  I didn't know if we could get involved with some trial studies, medicine or anything.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And uh they said that they weren't because of the holidays able to get an appointment but once he was discharged they would try to get an appointment.  When they gave him an appointment it was a snow storm [REDACTED] to go on a Thursday.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
SECOND PERSON O721
And I couldn't take my husband out in a snowstorm.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
So I made another appointment for this week which is Thursday.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh at to see Oncology, I don't know.
DOCTOR: So you have one on Thursday?
SECOND PERSON O721
I have an appointment at 8:45 for Oncology that I made for this week but I don't know what they'll be able to do.  If they don't examine him I'll be very irate.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
I will be very upset if they don't even examine him.  What I don't like, can I say this, I hate for people to just conclude.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
I hate waiting, I hate for people to just, can I finish, give up and that's what Iâ€™m feeling.  When Hospice comes to your home, the reason why I don't like their philosophy, they're coming in in terms of treating the symptoms.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
In terms of saying well we don't do this yet.  So far they have not been able to control the pain.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And make PATIENT, my husband, comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you finished or do you still have something you want to tell me?
SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah I want to tell you that uh he's so thin, he's had such tremendous weight loss that I was wondering is it possible for them to give him some type of donut or something?
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
Right, well I mean I guess it'll come from Hospice, I don't know if it'll come from the VA Hospice.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
This donut cause he's so, he started getting a decubitus.  It was just, it wasn't even 1 centimeter, it was like half of a centimeter or something.
DOCTOR: Does he have one now?  A decubitus?
SECOND PERSON O721
On his coccyx area.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
But what happens that, it was just like a skin break.
DOCTOR: We'll look at it.
SECOND PERSON O721
And uh they, they put a dressing to it before he left the hospital and I don't know if it's showing up on the computer now and so but if you have these donuts or stuff would that help?
DOCTOR: Probably not.
SECOND PERSON O721
No.
DOCTOR: The donuts don't help decubitus ulcers.  We'll take a look at it.
SECOND PERSON O721
Maybe it'll help in the wheelchair.
PATIENT: It might not do anything [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: We'll look at it and then I'll let you know what I think okay.  But to address the initial part of your conversation, so what I estimate and again we don't know all the in's and out's of what's going on here, having just met your husband but from what I saw being able to know the source of it.
SECOND PERSON O721
You feel that.
DOCTOR: From what I was able to, what's going on with you [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
I've got water but I.  Here honey, you want this for your medicine, come on honey.
PATIENT: And my throat [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
Honey I can't do this now, that's too hard.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I mean it's nothing.
SECOND PERSON O721
I don't [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I can't even get no [REDACTED] no.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
Come on take some water.
PATIENT: Get it out of here.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
Don't call her [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don't see no privacy.
(First and second doctors discuss patient between them)
SECOND PERSON O721
Here, here we go.  Okay you've got it.  Thank you very much.  Sorry [REDACTED] bad you know.  I'll fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay so essentially I think that what's going on here is that you're clearly frustrated cause you feel like people aren't properly um addressing all of the concerns that you have.  All of the pain that your husband's having.
SECOND PERSON O721
That's not true, that's not true okay.
DOCTOR: You're not frustrated.
SECOND PERSON O721
First of all I think they're doing everything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
I'm very pleased and satisfied with Hospice, itâ€™s not their fault that they have not been able to control.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
The pain, they've tried everything.  I'm not frustrated about anything.  I'm just haven't gave up.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
No one can make me give up.
DOCTOR: Let me finish, because otherwise we're probably not gonna make much progress here.  I understand that this is a very, this is a very difficult time and it's a very difficult situation.  It sounds like, from Oncology's perspective, they know that just from all of the data they have and from evaluating your husband they know from their estimation, their experience that there is nothing more that they feel they can do.  Now if he wants to see them again and re-address that issue I think that's a good idea and it sounds like you already have that plan so that's one thing.  I could not speak more on that.  I'm not a cancer doctor.
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I don't have an educated opinion about that beyond what it appears is this is a non-surgical situation um and you know if they think he's too weak for chemo or there's no appropriate trials out there they're the best ones to speak to that.  Now as far as pain goes yeah, if he's not getting adequate pain control then we need to keep working on that.  Um he's got a palliative doctor who's seeing him for pain control, is that correct or not?
SECOND PERSON O721
We don't [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Okay who prescribed his pain medicines right now?
SECOND PERSON O721
Um VA did and then Hospice.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we probably.
SECOND PERSON O721
Is that the palliative doctor, what's the?
DOCTOR: (Doctor asks the first doctor to look something up in the computer)
SECOND PERSON O721
So is that the doctor from the VA or is it the doctor from Hospice I'm never.
DOCTOR: Probably Hospice.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh it is.
DOCTOR: Um let's, we're looking.
SECOND PERSON O721
Hmm.
DOCTOR: (Doctors are checking the computer and discussing this between them)  See if we have, do you know the name of the person prescribing the pain medicine the?
SECOND PERSON O721
I can spell his name.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Would that help?
DOCTOR: Um it might, who?
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh, uh before he came into the hospital uh the Hospice doctor, his name was DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
Is that, I think it's something like that.
DOCTOR: Because really what we'd have to do, just so that we.
SECOND PERSON O721
I'm not sure.  I never saw him or talked to him.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
The only person I've ever seen is the uh the nurse, you know manager.
DOCTOR: And who's that?
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh his nurse manager her name is NAME.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So maybe, what, the best thing we could probably do is to try to get a hold of the people who are actually prescribing the pain medicines right now; I'll let them know we need to make some adjustments.  We could [REDACTED] entering them in but we probably need to work with you know, have a discussion with them about it and let them know that he's not getting adequate pain control.  Now let me be specific in terms of understanding how he's not getting adequate control.  PATIENT are you ever at a point where you're feeling like your pain is being well controlled or do you always have pain?
PATIENT: Um what they doing is they giving these.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it cuts me out; it cuts me off two hours.
DOCTOR: So you have a two hour period where before you can take it again you've got pain?
PATIENT: I got pain.
DOCTOR: Okay so before that two hours, youâ€™re doing okay?
PATIENT: Less than the two hours.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: When it come I have some pain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's kind of rough on it and we have to call, whoever we got to call.  I'm not going.
SECOND PERSON O721
They say [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Pay no mind.
SECOND PERSON O721
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Well this said you can take it every two hours.
PATIENT: That's all I said, two tablets in two hours.
SECOND PERSON O721
That didn't come from Hospice that came from VA.
PATIENT: VA gave me that.
DOCTOR: But you can take two tablets every two hours then [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right [REDACTED] price you know I mean I call in for the patches and all of this is higher than what the VA is giving me.
DOCTOR: No uh we don't mind.  You can get it through the VA.
PATIENT: I know you see but she is saying, when she calls the VA it's gonna be more.  I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right now we're trying to figure out what's gonna give you pain relief so like, the money.
SECOND PERSON O721
The VA, the VA gave him.
PATIENT: VA right here.
SECOND PERSON O721
The Dilaudid.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
He was on Vicodin until he came in here [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So how are we doing on the Dilaudid, along with the Fentanyl patch?
PATIENT: Fine, fine.
SECOND PERSON O721
Fine but, but he's doing okay but he has an anxiety problem and VA has said discontinue Ativan, we had to get the Ativan back from his Hospice um.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
So now he's on Zyprexa and Ativan.
DOCTOR: Okay but now we're going off on a tangent.  Let's focus on the pain first and then we can talk about another topic.  The pain is controlled with the Fentanyl patch and the Dilaudid that he's getting through the VA yes?
SECOND PERSON O721
PATIENT?  Cause I can't feel your pain.
PATIENT: All I know is what happenings here.
SECOND PERSON O721
For 45 minutes, that's what he's saying.
DOCTOR: There's only [REDACTED] it lasts about 45 minutes.
SECOND PERSON O721
45 minutes so is that controlled I don't know.
DOCTOR: So once he takes this for 45 minutes he's good and then it starts again.
SECOND PERSON O721
Yes.
DOCTOR: With just Dilaudid with two pills.
SECOND PERSON O721
Every two hours so if that 45 minutes or maybe it might be a little longer, maybe it's controlled for a hour but what I was saying to you is he has to have an anxiety pill.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
More than once a day but VA was the one that gave him that anxiety medicine but instead of once a day we had to give it twice.
DOCTOR: The Zyprexa?
SECOND PERSON O721
Zyprexa or he becomes very anxious.  I thought that it was very important for you to know.  He's anxious because of his pain.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I don't know, can you look up.
SECOND PERSON O721
So is it possible to take it twice a day?
DOCTOR: The Zyprexa, let me look it up, I honestly couldn't tell you.  It's not a medication I really prescribe.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh okay.
DOCTOR: It's fine every 12 hours.
DOCTOR: The Zyprexa, it says you can take it twice a day, the way it's written here.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay well okay.
DOCTOR: So that should be okay.  Now as far as the Dilaudid, now a half-life should be from one to two hours so theoretically.
SECOND PERSON O721
It's okay.
DOCTOR: I'm wondering if we could change this to one to two hours.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um.  (Doctor asks first doctor to look something up on the computer and they discuss patient)  So we're gonna look it up and I'll see if we can change it but really it's a discussion that needs to be had with whoever's controlling his pain but since I don't know how to get a hold of that person we can at least try to get you enough before they're gonna come, when do they contact you normally?
SECOND PERSON O721
Um they come, uh they come and see us every.
DOCTOR: Two weeks?
SECOND PERSON O721
No every, uh twice a week.
DOCTOR: Oh okay so when did you last see them?
PATIENT: Last Friday so they supposed to be Tuesday, today, but we had to come down here on appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay so they probably.
PATIENT: And Fridays, Tuesday and Fridays.
DOCTOR: And how do you contact them?
SECOND PERSON O721
They came last Tuesday; Friday they did not come she called though.  But they're in constant contact.  I don't have no problem with them.
DOCTOR: And you don't have a number?  No, no, I know.  Thatâ€™s not what I mean, so we can contact them.  Do you have a way?
SECOND PERSON O721
If you want to.
DOCTOR: Oh, they have a number.
SECOND PERSON O721
I can answer you, NUMBER.  I'm giving the direct number to my nurse manager.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
NUMBER.
DOCTOR: Okay hold on, this pen is not working.
SECOND PERSON O721
Just write it down, NUMBER.  The nurse manager's name is NAME.
DOCTOR: Okay I will call them.
SECOND PERSON O721
That's I only have one nurse, it's the nurse manager.
DOCTOR: So these people okay why don't we just talk to them.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.
DOCTOR: So then we'll talk to them about the hernia too because really I don't know that anyone's gonna feel like it's a good idea for him being weak and having this stage of cancer cause the only way to treat a hernia like this is surgically.  So um.
SECOND PERSON O721
They can't reduce no other kind of way?
DOCTOR: No there's no other way to, I mean it reduces on it's own but the only way to keep it gone is doing surgery.
SECOND PERSON O721
And do you know why it came, I mean this hernia.
DOCTOR: Um you know he could have.  Has he ever had surgery, it looks like he had surgery on his abdomen before.
SECOND PERSON O721
Yes, July of 2011.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
Last year.
DOCTOR: So wherever he had surgery before that part of the wall of the abdomen is probably a little weaker and thinner so it creates an area where it's vulnerable for other organs like bowels to poke through.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So.
SECOND PERSON O721
Wearing a belly band or something that don't help I mean wearing an um.
DOCTOR: I don't know that it's gonna make a huge difference here because it's not that big but it's clearly its causing pain so let me talk to the Hospice nurse too.  I don't mind referring him to Surgery to see what they have to say.  I just don't know what they're gonna offer him so I don't mind you talking to them and then they can tell you what they think um I just, by my estimation I'm not sure that they would feel it was safe for him to go through a surgery that's not a life-saving type surgery for a hernia you know so we wouldn't want to possibly do more harm than good for something that wasn't absolutely necessary.  Now if they look at it as well, keeping him comfortable is what we're trying to do and he's not comfortable maybe they'd be willing to, I honestly don't know so we can put in the referral and find out.
SECOND PERSON O721
With lung cancer are you supposed to, my question to you, have abdominal pain?  He's been having abdominal pain for six months.
DOCTOR: From the hernia?
SECOND PERSON O721
Right where's he's telling you now.
DOCTOR: Yeah from the hernia.  This isn't the cancer this is the hernia.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay well that's where his pain is.
DOCTOR: Right.
SECOND PERSON O721
And nothing in his chest.
DOCTOR: But what I'm saying is.
SECOND PERSON O721
So that's not from the cancer it's from the hernia.
DOCTOR: No it's from the hernia.  Where he's pointing to is the hernia.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so let's just go on and talk to the [REDACTED] guy or let me look at your backside first okay.  You know your wife told me you had that ulcer.  Do you mind if I look at it?  I'm gonna just grab some gloves first okay.  Let me squeeze past you here.
PATIENT: Now look at what, what are you looking at?
DOCTOR: Um.
SECOND PERSON O721
Yes, that's alright, no skin breakdown.
DOCTOR: No skin breakdown.  Like stage 1, just a little erythema?
SECOND PERSON O721
Yes.
DOCTOR: So usually how we dress those is just a transparent dressing and then.
SECOND PERSON O721
Well when he was in the hospital they, he was here in the VA a month ago, they was putting a dressing on it and he was bleeding and the skin had broke down so maybe.
DOCTOR: He looks pretty good.
DOCTOR: Okay how we usually either prevent further worsening.
SECOND PERSON O721
Because of his thinness.
DOCTOR: Yeah what we would probably do is recommend things like a hospital type bed.  He probably needs to have one of those.  Frequent turning, you know good nutrition, all those things.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um because otherwise you know obviously if he's running down a lot he's at risk for developing you know.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh I see.
DOCTOR: Further ones or getting this one to advance.  So I mean we could at least put in a referral.
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh you know we didn't come today because of his pain we're just saying that he's uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand.
SECOND PERSON O721
Because of the um, but he's been having this, he's been having, this is what I'm asking you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
I guess people don't listen.  He's been like this for what six months.
DOCTOR: Right.
SECOND PERSON O721
So if it's not from the cancer.
PATIENT: Now why don't you let her talk?
DOCTOR: Like I said it's from the hernia.
PATIENT: Now that's all, I just want you to call her since my medication, I don't know if these people can give me some.
DOCTOR: So we're gonna refer you to a doctor for your hernia.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] anything you can do about the hernia.
DOCTOR: I believe this is the hernia causing the pain, not the cancer.
PATIENT: No it ain't the cancer, if it would the other side would be.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: No it's not the cancer.
DOCTOR: So he does not have any cancer in his abdomen from what we were able to see so this is not the cancer causing this pain.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh he gave us NicoDerm patches.
DOCTOR: Yes.
SECOND PERSON O721
She said that they didn't provide them, the VA gave it to them so when we came over here the nurse I talked to her twice today, she said make sure that we ask for the NicoDerm.
DOCTOR: Yeah we can't write for those, we'll have to refer him cause they won't let us write for those.
SECOND PERSON O721
But they gave it to us when he left the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand they can in the hospital but they can't on an outpatient basis.  It's just the VA [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay can I say something to you, cause I see you didn't hear me.  When he left here on discharge they gave him NicoDerm.
DOCTOR: I understand that.  I cannot write for it as an outpatient doctor.  They can do that as an inpatient doctor.
SECOND PERSON O721
Oh.
DOCTOR: I understood what you said.
SECOND PERSON O721
The Lidoderm either?
DOCTOR: The Lidoderm we also cannot do.  So we can try to find out how to get them, that's what we're gonna do.
SECOND PERSON O721
Are you angry?
DOCTOR: No I'm not angry but I just, you're telling me that I'm not listening but I've heard everything you've said.  I just want you to realize that I still can't do it.  All I can do is try to find out how we can facilitate fully and that's what we're gonna do.
SECOND PERSON O721
The nurse is the one that gave me these directions; I talked to her twice this morning.
DOCTOR: Sure.
SECOND PERSON O721
She told me to ask for the NicoDerm.  She told me to ask for the Lidoderm.  She told me to ask for um all the medicine.  Everything I'm saying.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
I got directives from my Hospice nurse.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They're just watching over me, [REDACTED] giving it back.
DOCTOR: I know they [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay. The nurse um told me to ask for this.
DOCTOR: Sure I understand.
PATIENT: I'm ready to go, I [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
Why are you ready to go?
PATIENT: Cause I'm hurting, man I been hurting, let's just go.
SECOND PERSON O721
But you just took [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
He just took the medicine.  [REDACTED] kick in [REDACTED] 30 minutes or 45?
DOCTOR: It should [REDACTED] kick in [REDACTED] like that, 35-40 minutes.
DOCTOR: He's taken the medicine twice since he's been here.  I really don't want [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Almost 12 o'clock.
SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah.
PATIENT: I'll wait till 1 o'clock.
SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.
PATIENT: 2 o'clock is an hour.
SECOND PERSON O721
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: 2 o'clock is two.
SECOND PERSON O721
And you took two, well that's four pills he's taken since he's been here right?  Two before you left home, that's six pills, so that's why you gonna change it to every one to two hours.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Uh we're gonna put that in.
PATIENT: Hours.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] doing.
PATIENT: Two uh.
DOCTOR: So let's give them a call to see if we can find out what they've been doing and then um.
SECOND PERSON O721
They call the VA.
DOCTOR: The thing is, we donâ€™t want to be giving um, we don't want to be giving; we want to find out so we're not all giving a bunch of different regimens.  We want to have one regimen for him.  Okay we're giving you one thing and they're giving something else.
SECOND PERSON O721
I see.  When um when he was discharged I gave the nurse the computer sheet that they give you when you leave the hospital.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
And she followed everything that um, she was the one that told the VA had wrote down for me cause he was on Vicodin so the VA changed it to Dilaudid, not Hospice.  Only thing that we have changed was he needs his Ativan or he can't function.  He has to have that.
DOCTOR: So how come, how come they're not prescribing it at home then?
SECOND PERSON O721
They are.
DOCTOR: So they are prescribing it, so he doesn't need that cause you guys have it right?
SECOND PERSON O721
We have the Ativan.
DOCTOR: Okay so you don't need the Ativan.
SECOND PERSON O721
No.  The VA had said discontinue the Ativan cause they were giving Zyprexa but he has to take the Zyprexa and the Ativan so I don't give this other Seroquel because I'm giving Ativan you know good with some food and I'm giving Zyprexa so I have not gave the Seroquel.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
But that's what I was trying to tell her.
DOCTOR: That's because you don't want to over medicate him or just so you can have it [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON O721
I have never gave all of it.
DOCTOR: You've never tried to give all of them?
SECOND PERSON O721
No, no.
DOCTOR: Well, they act differently.
SECOND PERSON O721
Well because one is an anti-psychotic and one is what anti-anxiety.
DOCTOR: Yes.  One is anti-psychotic and one is anti-anxiolytic.
SECOND PERSON O721
The Zyprexa is the anti-psychotic.
DOCTOR: Right.
SECOND PERSON O721
The Seroquel is anti-psychotic right?  It's for PTSD, his PTSD.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
SECOND PERSON O721
That's what the Seroquel is for and the Zyprexa is just given for anti-psychotic.
DOCTOR: It's usually given at night for insomnia.
SECOND PERSON O721
Insomnia.  But he takes it twice a day with the Ativan together.  When I give him one I give the other.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright so we'll have the labs checked.  You can go over to the Laboratory after this.
SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah I came for the visit so I just wanted his electrolytes [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
So I'll be back down.
DOCTOR: Of course and in terms of the um the constipation, is he taking the Docusate or is he out of that?
SECOND PERSON O721
He's got all of his, he's got the suppositories and what he don't have, she told me to write everything down so we can talk about it, he don't have the, I'm not frustrated about anything.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
I just didn't want him to go; he was in bad shape when he came in here on Christmas.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
I didn't want him to get back like that again um.  He's taking the um, he needs the patch for smoking NicoDerm, he needs the Lidoderm patch.
DOCTOR: So the Lidoderm patch I don't see in here so we have to call them to find out what's going on with that.
SECOND PERSON O721
Right and um he needs the um Fentanyl patch and you were saying to and then increase it to 100 instead of 50 or just wait [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: She's gonna manage the pain stuff and she's calling over to the nurse that you're talking about.  So she's gonna take care of that.
SECOND PERSON O721
That's been his nurse for the last five months so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON O721
We get a lot of medicines so, all his medicines this nurse didn't prescribe VA prescribed so um but we been coming here so much, we came in here.  I'm glad ya'll are gonna do the labs to see where he is, bloodwork, so his calcium won't be real high or low or whatever and he doesn't get real sick like he was Christmas.  I spent Christmas at VA Hospital and New Year's.  I was here for nine days so.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON O721
I don't want him to get back in that shape if they could catch it.  I mean would the VA Hospital allow him to get the IV therapy or they don't do that?
DOCTOR: For what though?
SECOND PERSON O721
His electrolyte imbalance.
DOCTOR: Well we don't know what his electrolytes are.
SECOND PERSON O721

DOCTOR: Um if it was bad enough yeah.
SECOND PERSON O721
Cause he was real bad when he um came in here Christmas.
DOCTOR: Oh if it was bad enough they would just put him in.
SECOND PERSON O721

I got 17 grandkids and I'll be asking are you hungry, if you say you don't want eggs then I'll ask them do you want waffles or does you want cold cereal or you want orange juice or do you want nothing and so that's saying something.  I'm doing the same thing here I'm asking what can we do as a team trying to work for the patient, PATIENT.  That's the only thing I'm asking, is that allowed?
DOCTOR: Of course it's allowed, of course it's allowed.

DOCTOR: Well I don't know where she is, I mean she's gonna have you know give you a call to tell you guys to come get them, or she'll have to mail them.  So in terms of the Dilaudid, I can't get in the system right now because she's in it so what we're gonna have to do is um if you can come up like tomorrow and pick it up from the Pharmacy.
PATIENT: No we live too far.
DOCTOR: Then it'll have to be mailed.
PATIENT: Uh can't we just wait outside until?
DOCTOR: You can wait outside and eventually when she's logged out of the system I could try to go back in and then get it so you could pick it up today.
SECOND PERSON O721
You can't get his pain medicines?
DOCTOR: I can't even; it's all I'm locked out right now because she's putting in the orders.  So if you guys want to hang out I can try to log back in once the pharmacist is out of the system and you can possibly get the medication today.
