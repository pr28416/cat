DOCTOR: Mhmm. OK, and how about uh, how about allergies? Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, like uh, just seasonal. Not to any medications or anything.
DOCTOR: OK. Uhm, have you been in touch with anyone sick recently around you?
PATIENT: No, like the only person I see is my husband. I guess him, and so he has a PSW that comes in to take care of him. He has a couple more problems than I do. So basically, we see I see him and her and we see we see our kids, but just like outside.
DOCTOR: OK. OK and alright and then, uhm, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, no
DOCTOR: No, OK. Dietary wise, are you like eating healthy?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I think so. I try to, you know, cook, you know, whole foods for us like lots of veggies and you know fish and good meat. Although in the past you know few days, I just 'cause I felt really rundown and fatigued, I haven't been eating as much as I normally do.
DOCTOR: OK.
PATIENT: Otherwise, I think we pretty healthy I try to, you know, follow healthy recipes and find them online.
DOCTOR: Yeah, for sure. Yeah, that's good. Do you, do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: No, OK, and any other recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, never.
DOCTOR: OK. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: I'll have the occasional glass of wine on a special occasion, but not frequently and not, not heavily.
DOCTOR: OK. And where do you live and who do you live with right now?
PATIENT: Uh, just me and my husband. We live outside of town. We live in the country on a little farm.
DOCTOR: OK. Any old carpets or dust or mold or asbestos in the, in the home?
PATIENT: No, no we renovated probably 15 years ago, and there's no no more carpet, and there were never any asbestos problems or anything.
DOCTOR: OK. OK, well I think those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions for myself?
PATIENT: I don't think so. I just I hope you know we can get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Yeah, for sure. So we'll start with doing a Covid swab because you have some symptoms that overlap with it, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. But it does sound like what you're telling me with the wet cough and you know a little bit of shortness of breath, I think it's worthwhile to get a chest x-ray to see if you might possibly have a pneumonia, and if you do, if there is some consolidation we'll probably prescribe some antibiotics for that. Umm, how does that sound to you?
PATIENT: Sounds great to me. Yeah, I just you know, hope there's nothing serious going on.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, and it shouldn't be. It's probably 1 something that's been going around in the community and you haven't had any recent hospitalizations or surgery, so I wouldn't worry about like any of those atypical bugs just yet.
PATIENT: OK, OK, that's good to hear.
DOCTOR: Yeah, for sure. Well, uhm, thank you.
PATIENT: OK, thank you.
