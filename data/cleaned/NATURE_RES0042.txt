DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah for sure and I think it's a good thing that you came in, so thank you. Right now, I guess top on the list of things that you could possibly have is COVID, so we'll get you tested for that and we'll get you a swab and you should have the results of the that swab in about 24 to 48 hours and then you should isolate for 14 days regardless though because your symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID. And, and that includes isolating from your your children as well.
PATIENT: Oh ok.
DOCTOR: And yeah, and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral illness that's going around at this time of year, just so just make sure you're staying hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods and getting good sleep. If your symptoms do become worse, and if they become uhm, severe like you have a really high temperature, you have trouble breathing or you have any neurological symptoms like seizures or fainting spells, please do go to the ER and seek help. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Ah yeah, I guess that sounds good. This is how it's gotta be, right?
DOCTOR: Yeah, unfortunately, or yeah. Well, thank you again.
PATIENT: No, thank you. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too.
