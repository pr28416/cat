DOCTOR: PATIENT?  How are you today?
PATIENT: Fine, fine.  Better.
DOCTOR: It is.  We need to go down this way.  [REDACTED] Is it raining outside?
PATIENT: Uh it was a little bit.
DOCTOR: Little bit.  Well it's clearing up.
PATIENT: Yeah uh-huh.  It's going to come later.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: How are things going?
PATIENT: Uh fine.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh no complaints.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: I'm feeling very well.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Uh I need uh.
DOCTOR: Some refills.
PATIENT: Some refills yeah.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: And I brought a list of my medications.
DOCTOR: Sure, let's take a look.
PATIENT: And I have one question.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: On one of them.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm uh you know daily on the lovastatin.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Triamterene.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And the potassium supplements.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Yep.
PATIENT: However, when my prescription comes they have a warning.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: For people who take triamterene.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh saying that it can raise your body's potassium level.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And do not use potassium supplements if you're taking triamterene.
DOCTOR: Right and that is something that it causes normally but your potassium, even with the supplement is low.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we're watching that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We have our eye out for it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But we, if your potassium drops too low it's bad for your heart.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So we have to keep an eye on it.
PATIENT: Uh I.
DOCTOR: So we do check it with every lab we do with you but so far this is working so we're gonna stay on it.
PATIENT: And I eat a banana every day.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's fine.  Just don't eat like 12 yeah.  Cause that would be bad.  Yeah a banana every day is perfect.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: And then what else is going on?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The aspirin you're taking low dose.  Do you get it through us?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: Do you want to?  I don't know what the cost difference would be but we could try if you want.  I can write this for you and I can write the multivitamin for you.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Or do you prefer to get them yourself?
PATIENT: I can get them myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's fine.
PATIENT: Uh I will need the lovastatin renewed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I have about ten tablets let.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you want to pick it up downstairs or do you want us to mail to you.
PATIENT: Um you can send it in the mail.
DOCTOR: Okay let's do that now so we don't forget.  Now what's the dose you're taking now?
PATIENT: Uh the lovastatin.
DOCTOR: Do you take 40?
PATIENT: 40 mg.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You want 90-day supply?
PATIENT: A 90-day supply yeah.
DOCTOR: Wonderful.
PATIENT: Uh but my cholesterol is in good shape?
DOCTOR: Yeah I was just looking at that before you walked in.  So your cholesterol, your total cholesterol is 195 uh your good cholesterol is 50 so that's really good and we want it above 40.  So diet, exercise, that kind of stuff.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And then your LDL is 103 and you're not a diabetic and so a man your age with high blood pressure should be below 100 cause you're right at that cusp.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: At 100.  So I mean we're kind of sitting where we need to at this point.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So it's good okay.  Um and then I was looking at your other labs so your potassium, like I told you, it's even on like the low end of normal even with the supplement.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So we're okay with staying with what we're doing.  The kidney function is good.  Your fasting glucose was really good.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That means you're not like pre-diabetic or anything like that.
PATIENT: Right every time it's been tested it's at 90 so.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: So what did it do this time?
DOCTOR: It was 95.
PATIENT: 95.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes and then um and then I checked your liver enzymes cause people that are on statin for a long time you just want to monitor.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: To see how the liver is doing and those are totally normal.  Um and then.
PATIENT: And then uh last year I took the uh oral anti-fungal for 90 days.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: So there was concern that that would uh.
DOCTOR: Damage your liver.
PATIENT: …danage the liver yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah no so those are perfect.  Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh that resulted in all the toenails look perfect.
DOCTOR: Oh good.  Good and we're done with that right?
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: You're done with the whole, okay good.  Good and then we also checked your, what we call a CBC which is like the white blood cell count, the hemoglobin and your platelets and those are all normal.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we don't have to worry about anemia or anything like that.
PATIENT: Right but before I had high levels of triglycerides, is that?
DOCTOR: Yeah so your triglycerides are pretty high but we want you around 150 and you're at 200.  Um have you ever taken like niacin?
PATIENT: Uh well I take a multivitamin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And that has niacin in it.
DOCTOR: Yeah but niacin itself is probably a little bit stronger.  We can try niacin and see how you respond to it and recheck them in like three months um.
PATIENT: What causes the triglycerides to be so high?
DOCTOR: A lot of it is genetics and then some of its diet so you know a high fat diet can cause you to have a lot of triglycerides.
PATIENT: I'm on a low fat diet.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes it's genetic so kind of take care of it.
PATIENT: Uh but alcohol would elevate it?
DOCTOR: Alcohol can absolutely.  Let me see where they were before.  Yeah I mean you were at 219 before, you're 209 now.  You've always been around 200.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I'm guessing it's more of a, yeah it's more of a genetic component.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Cause your diet seems like it's pretty good, from the last time we talked.  So good.  So yeah I mean you can try niacin.  I can give it to you through the VA.  Is this a B vitamin?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And the side effects of that is some people get flushing.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Like they just feel very hot and red.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then the answer to that would be a slow-release niacin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You know a slower acting for your systems, kind of a tablet that's slower.  Do you want to try it?
PATIENT: I'll try that uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let's go ahead and do that and then we'll recheck everything in a couple of months.  90-day supply, see how you tolerate it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I'd say about maybe 15% of people have that reaction so, hopefully you won't.  Okay um and what about your other medicines, the cholesterol pill?
PATIENT: Uh my potassium supplement I got a 60-day supply left.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And no refills.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So maybe I need it.
DOCTOR: We'll do that and then I'll give you enough refills.  How's your blood pressure been doing in the last year?
PATIENT: Uh it's been fine.  I have uh a device I use on my wrist to measure it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But uh it gives me fairly high readings and the device is inaccurate.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh when they tested the blood pressure I was about 112/72.
DOCTOR: Yeah this number is really good.
PATIENT: Which is.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm getting 145/90.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: When I test at home.
DOCTOR: Do you want a different um monitor?  I can order you one from the VA.
PATIENT: How much is that gonna cost?
DOCTOR: I don't think it costs very much at all and you just pick it up downstairs in the Prosthetics Department.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: On your way out.  Do you want that?
PATIENT: I bought this thing and I paid 90 some dollars for it.
DOCTOR: It's definitely less than that.  I feel the wrist ones can be pretty inaccurate.
PATIENT: I think so.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I mean you can go pick up one at Walgreens.  I prefer you get the cuff or I can order one through the VA which is probably cheaper for you.  I'm not exactly sure how much they charge but.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: When you go pick it up you can ask them and if you don't want it.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Then don't take it.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Do you want to do that at least?
PATIENT: I'll try that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright because I repeat the tests on the wrist and a couple of minutes later the figure is all different.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Doesn’t seem reliable.
PATIENT: It's a general estimation though.
DOCTOR: Yes.  The potassium needed some refills too.  This was followed up in November.  You were just taking potassium and chloride okay.  So we also this time around checked your prostate.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: To see what your prostate hormone was doing and it's a little bit elevated.  Has anyone ever told you that before?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Cause I know you, let's see you started following here at the VA a couple of years ago or was it how long ago?
PATIENT: Uh it's almost two years.
DOCTOR: Two years okay.  No one's ever checked here at the VA so I don't know what your records were on the outside.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um but it's a little bit elevated so it's a little concerning.  It could be many different things and most likely it's probably the gland itself just gets bigger as you age.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um and that's what most people you know end up having a high PSA.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It can also be, if it's really, really high, it can also be prostate cancer um but yours isn't to that level at this point.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But I still want to keep an eye on it and probably send you to see the urology doctors.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, just for them to kind of keep an eye on things.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: To watch it a little bit closer.  Are you having any urinary symptoms at home like when you wake up at night and have to go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Uh I've had uh you know frequent and urgent urination for a long time.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh I think probably it's due to the blood pressure medication.
DOCTOR: Okay yeah since it's a diuretic.
PATIENT: It's a diuretic.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: Uh I take the blood pressure medications in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not at night, if I take it at night I have to get up.
DOCTOR: Get up.
PATIENT: In the night.
DOCTOR: If you take it in the morning how often do you get up at night to go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Uh I don't have to get up at night.
DOCTOR: You don't have to get up.  Do you ever have to um kind of go to the bathroom multiple times in a row to empty your bladder fully?
PATIENT: Not really no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you ever feel like it takes a while for you to start a urine stream or it just won't come out?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, so yeah we'll just you know, we'll have you go to the urology doctors and have them kind of take a look at it okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's a good thing to catch early.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: For sure, in case anything is going on.
PATIENT: And I also see a dermatologist.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She's very good.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh she has tried to do something for my lip.  Uh the first that she wanted me to try.
DOCTOR: Like a prescription.
PATIENT: Is a 2.5% cream.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: It really has no effect.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My lip won't heal.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  What happened there?
PATIENT: Uh I had surgery to remove a very large growth.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Under my left.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The one on my back of my neck was basal cell carcinoma.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: This one was like a large tumor due to sun damage.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But it was not basal cell.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh it's never healed properly and my lip was numb and for eight years the skin peeled off my lips.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Every other day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh she wanted me to try this one.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I haven't been back to talk to her since she wanted me to try but this doesn't do anything.
DOCTOR: Isn't helping either.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: When did you last see her?
PATIENT: Uh I saw her um maybe three or four months ago.
DOCTOR: Okay and that's when she gave you the last cream?
PATIENT: She gave me the last one yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's not working.
PATIENT: She said to see if it would work.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh I still have plenty of it left.  I stopped taking it.
DOCTOR: But it's not working.  How long did you try it before you kind of?
PATIENT: Uh I used it for uh almost two months.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah, that's a good try.  So you're supposed to go back and seen them in June, June 11th it looks like.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay, no it's July, July 11th.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Do you want to see if we can get you in earlier?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Is it really bothering you or are you just kind of.
PATIENT: It doesn't really bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But uh, it's slightly sore.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And the skin peels off of it every other day.  It's been doing that for eight years.
DOCTOR: You can't seem to get it under control huh.  Yeah.  So you're like what's going on yeah.  I'll let them deal with that department since I usually don't do that.
PATIENT: Well during the surgery they pulled the skin from the inside of my mouth.
DOCTOR: Out.
PATIENT: To form a lip.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And that skin, it cannot be exposed.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Maybe that's why yeah.
PATIENT: It has something to do with it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, definitely.  It's not made to be outside the mouth so.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well it looks great; it looks really good though you know as you said it was a pretty big mass.
PATIENT: Uh it was very large under my lip.
DOCTOR: Yeah, alright.
PATIENT: And they did two surgeries.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And at the first surgery.
DOCTOR: Where was that done?
PATIENT: Uh it was done by a plastic surgeon.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Was it at Hines?
PATIENT: No Rush, Oak Park.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh and then your ears, how's that going?  You're following with Audiology.
PATIENT: Uh yes the hearing aids are working very well.
DOCTOR: Perfect, perfect.
PATIENT: I have a device for the telephone also so I'm now able to hear on the phone calls.
DOCTOR: Oh good, that's good.  Alright.  Okay I was just putting in your Urology referral.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: For you to go see them.  Okay.  Anything else going on?
PATIENT: Uh not that I can think of.
DOCTOR: How's your weight been doing?  Are you up, down?
PATIENT: I'm probably gaining a little weight.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh after I left the hospital I lost 10 pounds.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But now I've gained it all back again.
DOCTOR: You gained it all back huh.  Yeah it looks like you were.
PATIENT: I went down to 180.
DOCTOR: Yeah, about this time last year you were about the same.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Around like 190.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh that's really too heavy for.
DOCTOR: Yeah, they have um, they have different programs here you know for like exercise and new programs, like the MOVE program where they kind of teach you different exercise things to do and also like diet.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: If you're interested I mean its more trips to the VA if you can and if not I mean.
