DOCTOR: PATIENT.

DOCTOR: Good.  We go all the way to the end.  Are you doing okay?  Any problems?  I'm DOCTOR.
PATIENT: How you doing?
DOCTOR: Nice to meet you.  Uh anything new going on that you wanted to talk about?
PATIENT: Not really.
DOCTOR: No, okay.  So this is just kind of a routine visit?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just a different doctor, different doctor.
DOCTOR: There's always a different doctor I know, I know.  Alright.  Your blood pressure's a bit high; um it's in the 150s.  What does it usually run at home or do you check it at all?
PATIENT: Well I haven't checked it lately but when she was, the first time she did it it stayed high?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  It was 152 and on the repeat it was 154.
PATIENT: Oh it was, see we was talking.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I wasn't you know if you get upset the blood pressure goes up.
DOCTOR: Oh I know, absolutely.
PATIENT: So I was talking about what DOCTOR did to me and that made my blood pressure go.
DOCTOR: Oh okay so you were upset.
PATIENT: So you might need to check it again and see if I'm relaxed some you know.
DOCTOR: Oh sure yeah we'll check it in a little bit.  Hopefully you won't.
PATIENT: Cause I mean that's what happened you know.  I got, a little I think I got a little upset cause of what she did to me, stuff like that you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Otherwise it don't really be high I me.  When I took it at home it was like 130 something you know or something like that.  You know it don't be high like 150.
DOCTOR: Sure, alright okay.  Let's see, I'm just gonna look at your lab work to see if there's anything done here recently.
PATIENT: I don't think so; I didn't have no blood taken in a while.
DOCTOR: Yeah we need to update that.  The last time you had anything was um electrolytes and checking your kidney function in July and back then it was okay.  So will you be able to go to the Lab, I mean have you eaten yet today?
PATIENT: Yeah I ate this morning.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Ate this morning, but I ain't had nothing for lunch.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So.
PATIENT: Which is more than like before 6 o'clock so you should be able to draw some blood right?
DOCTOR: Yeah the, unfortunately I want to check your cholesterol too and to check your cholesterol you can't have eaten anything um from midnight until you get the lab work and then.
PATIENT: So I got to come back okay.
DOCTOR: So yeah.  Yeah and you can do that anytime within the next month and I'll take a look at them and in the computer a follow-up.
PATIENT: Come in here, don't eat no breakfast, come in here and get it drawn and then you'll have that here.
DOCTOR: Right, yep, nothing after midnight and then come in here.  You know where you get it checked.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah I know where I need to go.
DOCTOR: Yeah because I know you were hospitalized at St. Francis a little while ago.
PATIENT: That's cause I was given some metformin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It was too strong for me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It was too strong, it was 850 mg and it bothered my, I think the doctor said my liver or my kidneys one and when I got in the hospital he said no it no good for you which is, it was bothering me because it was sending me to the bathroom every hour, before the hour.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Forceful urination.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then it finally of dehydrated me so I had to go to the Emergency Room at St. Francis cause the ambulance took me to the closest hospital to my house.
DOCTOR: Did they check your sugars then?  Did they see how high those were?
PATIENT: I think they checked everything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Otherwise they would've let me go.
DOCTOR: So now what are you taking for your blood sugars?
PATIENT: Glipizide and then metformin.
DOCTOR: Oh you're still taking the metformin.
PATIENT: But only at that lower dosage cause you she me 850 mg and when I told them it made me sick, they changed me down to 450.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's what she did and its better but it's still almost like the same thing cause I have to go, it won't let me hold, I can't hold.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: No water, I have to go.  It don't matter where I'm at.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's like that feeling come on I have to go.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it come out, that's how those pills, some pills do me.  For some reason, I don't know why.
DOCTOR: So yeah, you know everybody reacts differently to medications.  Most of my patients who have diabetes are on 1000 of metformin twice a day.  That's the regular dose.
PATIENT: I don't think it's too strong for anybody.
DOCTOR: No it's actually, I mean it.
PATIENT: I guess it all depends on how your sugars is running.
DOCTOR: Oh it depends on your sugars.
PATIENT: Yeah cause mine are running [REDACTED]@ high.
DOCTOR: They're not running that [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Yeah so that's what I'm saying.
DOCTOR: Yeah absolutely, it depends on your sugars.  We don't want to drop your sugars too low and then um it really depends on each person and how they react to the medication.  You know in general metformin is one that a lot of people do tend to tolerate but everybody's different so you know you might have had urinary frequency from that.  A lot of times blood sugars being high can cause urinary frequency too.
PATIENT: But like I said I been controlling my sugars.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
PATIENT: And the thing is she took me off of insulin and said I shouldn't be taking insulin which I been taking insulin all along and put me on the metformin.  Uh the metformin, the dose that she gave me was too strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, good.
PATIENT: Because it was like sending me to the bathroom, just automatically just hurried up and ended me sending me to the bathroom and I never went to the bathroom that many times like that there and then finally it dehydrated me cause it just really dehydrates you.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I’m sitting at home and boom I got dehydrated and almost passed out.
DOCTOR: So you're okay on the 500?
PATIENT: Uh 450 yeah, I'm better with it, 450 you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause if it was bothering me I wouldn't want to take that either.  I mean I don't need to take something that makes me sick or make me go to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well um, let me see, so what I want to do is to check your cholesterol and I'm also gonna check your sugars and how they're being controlled.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um do you test your sugars at home?
PATIENT: Sometimes I do, I stopped doing it for a while because you know that's two fingers every day and them fingers.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And them fingers, see all the marks on my fingertips there.
DOCTOR: Absolutely.
PATIENT: Cause I just learn, the new nurses that uh at Cabrini showed me how to do it from the side so it don't you know cause I usually doing the tips, that's what I was taught to prick the tips, now I know to do the sides.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But you see all the marks, because I been doing it for awhile. I mean I said I feel great I mean.  I aint’ feeling bad, I don't think I be having to draw, taking that sugar every day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But if you want me to take it every other day or something like then give you the results, I can do that.
DOCTOR: Yeah you know if it's stable every other day, every couple days then that's fine.
PATIENT: Then what, so what, how high should the sugar go?
DOCTOR: After you eat.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It's okay for it to go to 150-160.
PATIENT: Okay after I eat but before I eat, I usually take it before I eat.
DOCTOR: Yeah before you eat I tend to like to see it 110 and below.
PATIENT: 110 and below.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.  110 and below.
DOCTOR: But the test that I'm gonna do is going to check your blood sugars and how they've been controlled over the past three months, it's a test that kind of can see how it's been over the past month to three months.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we'll get a better idea.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: Um let's see.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: When was that?  Oh actually I see it here, oh it was 2010.
PATIENT: I had a couple of those and the other one go down through my throat too.
DOCTOR: And in 2010 it looks like.
PATIENT: I had triple bypass, I had a gallbladder taken out, what else.  That's about it, the triple bypass and gallbladder taken out.  I don't have no gallbladder or whatever cause she said I had too many kidney stones and they had to take the bladder.
DOCTOR: So you're good, cause they didn't see any precancerous tumors or anything in the colonoscopy.
PATIENT: Right, it was clear.
DOCTOR: So that's good.
PATIENT: It was all clear, no polyps, no none of that other stuff.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: It was clear.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
PATIENT: Both times it was clear.
DOCTOR: Good.  And then have you had the influenza shot this year?
PATIENT: She told me to come back and uh, she told me to come back when December?
DOCTOR: No it looks like you had it.
PATIENT: I had it in March but she said it's time to take another one so, she said it was time to take another one so to come back in a month or so and take another one.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She said it due, unless you want me to take it today before I leave up out of here I mean.
DOCTOR: She wants you to take it today?
PATIENT: No, no, no, if you want me to.  She said come back and do it.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: That's what she told me to come back and do it.
DOCTOR: March was a bit early to get it so um you can get it done today, that's fine.
PATIENT: So where do I go get that at?
DOCTOR: You can just go to the nurse who checked you in.
PATIENT: And she'll give it to me?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Oh okay, that's good.
DOCTOR: And then it looks like all your medications are good through the next year.  All the refills that you need.
PATIENT: Yeah all the refills.  Cause the only thing I really had run out of was uh stool softeners, my wife who uses them too.
DOCTOR: Oh it looks like you have enough now, but do you need some more?
PATIENT: I mean, like I said my wife had some left over so I'm gonna use hers before I come and get some more.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I got that.  You know she had a bottle of 50 and I got that.
DOCTOR: Is it the same medication?
PATIENT: Its stool softeners.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: There any no different kind of stool softeners is there?
DOCTOR: Yes there's many different kinds of stool softeners.
PATIENT: So the ones you buy at the store are like, you go to the store like Dominic's, they ain't no good?
DOCTOR: Docusate, no they're good too but I'm just saying there are different kinds of stool softeners but at the same time you have to make sure you know the medication is what it is.  Is it prescribed to her or was it over-the-counter?
PATIENT: You go buy it, there's stool softeners on the shelf.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean you know.
DOCTOR: Oh I see.
PATIENT: And you go buy them.
DOCTOR: Why would you buy them, you can get them here.
PATIENT: Because I, well I ran out, I have to have time to get over here and get them right so I go and buy them every once in a while, I go buying them, you know you just go buy them.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: They don't cost over $10.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Instead of coming way over here cause I had to come a long ways to come over here just to get stool softeners.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Good enough.
PATIENT: And so she was taking uh iron pills like I was taking iron pills but the doctor took her off of them so she had a whole bottle full I mean, why not use the ones she has, I was taking before, it works.
DOCTOR: I'm not saying you can't.
PATIENT: No I'm just asking.
DOCTOR: I just don't think you should.
PATIENT: I was asking you cause you said different stool softeners, well I ain't seen no different ones myself.
DOCTOR: Do you check your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And you said it runs what?
PATIENT: It'll run in like [REDACTED] something.
