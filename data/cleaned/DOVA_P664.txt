DOCTOR: When you go to Podiatry.
PATIENT: Podiatry, I'll stop at the blood lab.
DOCTOR: Any questions for me at all?
PATIENT: Yes uh, every month.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or more often I have a Port-A-Cath flushed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Up on 9 East.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Would it be simpler to have the cholesterol check as part of that or be more complicated?
DOCTOR: You could do it during that time but the thing is I'm not sure if they'll have the labels printed out to their labs.
PATIENT: Oh you want to do it.
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter as long as it's drawn.  So what we could do is.
PATIENT: Cause I'll be glad to do it when I come in for my podiatry.
DOCTOR: Well you could do it when you get the Port-A-Cath done.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: When you get it flushed, ask them whether they can do your labs.
PATIENT: Okay for cholesterol.
DOCTOR: For your cholesterol.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: If they cannot then you'll have to go see downstairs.  The main reason is I'm not sure where those labels print out from.
PATIENT: Uh-huh no.
DOCTOR: Should the labels.
PATIENT: Well I don't want to complicate things.
DOCTOR: If they don't print out, just ask them.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: If they don't have the labels then you get it done downstairs.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Or if they can regenerate the label then it's perfectly fine.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: As long as the lab is done there.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So take your amlodipine, take your lisinopril.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The cholesterol medicine and that's it and a baby aspirin.
