PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let's see, that's good, hydralazine, make sure you're good to go with that.  Okay good.
PATIENT: Multivitamin.  I think that's just about everything.
DOCTOR: How you doing on your insulin?
PATIENT: Uh the insulin I have a good supply of.
DOCTOR: How much insulin are you actually taking now?  Uh Glargine the long-acting 70 units at night.
PATIENT: I cut back on that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: We're down to 55 on that now.
DOCTOR: Okay and then.
PATIENT: Cause my sugar was dropping in the middle of the night so we cut back to 55.  On the Aspart.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The human insulin cut back to 14 units.
DOCTOR: With each meal.
PATIENT: Uh morning, one in the morning and one at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How have your blood sugar levels been looking?
PATIENT: They been looking, I'm pretty good but like I said.
DOCTOR: When you wake up in the morning what is it?
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Oh you have a log.  Awesome. Let's see, yeah let’s take a peek at it.
PATIENT: Okay [REDACTED], uh this is this week.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's see, I see, so this is the time and that's the level?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  In the 150s and 170s and 115 okay.  And you check it, is this before you take your, is this before you take your evening?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah just before I eat and take the insulin.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any times where you've gone you know like below 70?
PATIENT: Oh yes.
DOCTOR: Yes, no, I see a 67 one night there.  What's that?
PATIENT: No 41.
DOCTOR: Before or after you started cutting back a little bit okay.  Alright.  I see some ones in here that but you started cutting back I see okay, yeah alright.  Did anyone tell you to cut back?
PATIENT: Oh they told me before when they first put me on it that if it should start dropping.
DOCTOR: Good.  I actually think that's appropriate.  Cause I don't want you, you know when you're 60, 70, that's a little too low.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's worrisome.  Were you shaking and feeling dizzy or?
PATIENT: Uh well it starts in the leg area.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they start tingling and then it goes up into the lips and then once it gets in there, then my eyes just seem to blur up the left eye and when that happens.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I know what's happening, something's going wrong.
DOCTOR: Over the past week how have things been?
PATIENT: Uh, this past uh.
DOCTOR: Any day.  It doesn't look like you've been low.
PATIENT: Sunday I didn't mark it down but Sunday morning it dropped down to 42 at about 3 o'clock in the morning I woke up, used the washroom and I was feeling kind of funny so I decided to take it.  You know when I took it, it was 42.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: It was 42 and uh I took some orange juice, drank some orange juice which was Sunny D and brought it back up.
DOCTOR: Is that the only time it's happened like that or is it?
PATIENT: Uh this week yeah.
DOCTOR: Is it, if you find yourself with blood sugar levels that low, that's pretty concerning.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um we might need to even go down a little bit more.  Most of your other levels though seems like they're, like 150s, 170s and 110s, it might be just a one isolated event.
PATIENT: Yeah well these uh perhaps when I had a light dinner.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh just what I did, I had just maybe just eaten a sandwich [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright well in those situations you might need to you know cut back a little.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Cause what you're doing is essentially covering yourself with insulin.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Absorb the sugar but if you suddenly don't have enough sugar, uh as much sugar as you normally have then you're giving yourself too much insulin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But if you think you're gonna you know not eat very much, cut back a little bit.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh but otherwise I mean on the whole these look pretty good uh.  Yeah and you know do you know what your goals are for the morning?
PATIENT: Uh off hand I don’t because they’ve been fluctuating so much.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's fluctuating so much.
DOCTOR: I mean ideally you know below 130, 120 in the morning.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: But and so you can, every few days you can go up about 2 units to try to get your, with the long-acting.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: To get yourself below there, with the caveat that if you're getting those low levels, those 60s, you know below 70s, even in the 60s or lower, something like that, then you've got to be more liberal and you have to give yourself a much bigger range, let yourself go higher.  Cause the going too low, that's more worrisome than having higher, slightly higher okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.  So I think uh I think that I'm actually gonna need a new, actually get myself a new meter, this one is not very accurate.  I don't know I tried calibrating it and everything but it still goes up and down so I don't get very good readings.
DOCTOR: Oh well let's try to get you a new.  It's the glucometer reading.
PATIENT: Right yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah I can certainly do that for you cause, we definitely need to have good readings.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  What should be an ideal blood pressure?
DOCTOR: For you, under, below 130/80.
PATIENT: So 130 over 80.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay.  I’ve been under the impression it should be below 139 and 80.
DOCTOR: Well not quite.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I had [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Tell me my reading should be.
DOCTOR: Well 130/80, that's what you want.
PATIENT: 130 over 80.  [REDACTED].  And the heartrate should be?
DOCTOR: Uh between 60 and 90.  Between 60 and 100.  You doing your long-acting in the morning or at night?
PATIENT: Uh in the morning.
DOCTOR: Good okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Have you always done it in the morning?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Alright yeah.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's probably best for you so that you don't bottom out at night.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Alright, I definitely agree with that.
PATIENT: Yeah DOCTOR started me on that one a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's sounds just right.
PATIENT: That's taking more away from, if it's gonna spike, it's gonna spike during the daytime when I'm awake.
DOCTOR: Exactly yeah.
PATIENT: That 285 scared me last month, but I know what that was from.
DOCTOR: Alright, I think I've got most of your medicines up-to-date now.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So we're getting them in there.  Okay, okay, okay.  You're still taking nifedipine right?
PATIENT: Yeah I needed that.
DOCTOR: Okay just wanted to make sure.

PATIENT: Uh yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Yeah actually let me put in an order right now to get the glucometer.
PATIENT: And some rubber gloves, latex gloves.
