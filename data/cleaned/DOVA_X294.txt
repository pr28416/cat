DOCTOR: PATIENT?  I read through the notes that um you [REDACTED] right.  They wanted to look at your heart and do an angiogram, remember that or no?
PATIENT: Yes I think I do remember that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I think you were supposed to come back to get that test done back in early January, not this week but like two weeks ago.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Did you remember that or?
PATIENT: Yes I remembered.
DOCTOR: But you forgot to come back or what happened?
PATIENT: I don't what happened.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah it's important.  We need to get this um you know, is your chest pain getting worse or?
PATIENT: Well you know I need something like Zantac or something like could you order me something like that?
DOCTOR: Yeah you have some ranitidine.
PATIENT: But it's not something that's working.
DOCTOR: Not working.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Well what kind of pain are you feeling?
PATIENT: Sharp.  And every now and then it's like a sharp pain and everything.
DOCTOR: Sharp pain.
PATIENT: Every now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay and when do you get that?  When you're walking or is it at rest?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And is that the pain you were telling the cardiologist or no?
PATIENT: Yeah and sometimes when I walk in heavy snow, something like that, it goes beat, beat, beat. And then I have to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, [REDACTED].  Okay then how far can you walk?  You said half a block before you get that chest pain.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is that the same or different?
PATIENT: Yeah about the same.
DOCTOR: About the same okay.
PATIENT: You think you could give me something for gas?
DOCTOR: Yeah I can give you something for gas but we need to make sure it's not your heart.
PATIENT: Yeah well I need something for gas.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Do you think it's because the belching makes that chest pain better.
PATIENT: Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay um and then how about, um do you feel short of breath when it happens?
PATIENT: Yeah I have to stop.
DOCTOR: You need to stop.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then it gets better?
PATIENT: Yes when I stop.
DOCTOR: Have you tried the nitroglycerin or no?
PATIENT: No, I got some.
DOCTOR: You've never tried taking it whenever you get the chest pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So you're able to walk about half a block before you get this sharp chest pain.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And where is it located?
PATIENT: Right up in here.
DOCTOR: Right up in there.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And it's sharp, it's not dull?
PATIENT: No it's [REDACTED] heart go [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay so you feel like your heart's beating really fast.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you ever feel this chest pain when you're just sitting here?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  How about do you feel nausea and want to vomit or feel like you're sweaty or anything like that?
PATIENT: Well sometimes I sweat a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: In the cold weather.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then um have you noticed problems laying flat in bed or notice any swelling in your legs or anything like that?
PATIENT: Well see this leg here, they was supposed to operate on it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it's swole, it’s swole now, slightly .
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay.  How long has that been swollen?  For a while or?
PATIENT: Oh yes, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Has it gotten worse?
PATIENT: No it's about the same.
DOCTOR: About the same?
PATIENT: Yeah it's the same.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright and then how about do you ever wake up at night feeling like you can't breathe or anything?  No.
PATIENT: It isn't no, it's every now and then, I do, but it’s slight.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know it's not.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um alright do you ever feel like, how many pillows do you sleep on, one or two or three or?
PATIENT: Actually one and a half.
DOCTOR: One and a half.  Has that changed or about the same?
PATIENT: About the same.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Could you tell me when are they gonna operate on me?
DOCTOR: Um let's see.  Did you see the doctor, the foot doctor I mean the orthopedist?  Oh you mean the cardiologist?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They wanted you to come back in - last week or two weeks ago.
PATIENT: Yeah there was a storm that day.
DOCTOR: Oh that day yeah.
PATIENT: I didn't make it in because of that storm.
DOCTOR: So you were supposed to come back last Thursday it was January 4th, was...  Yeah you were supposed to come the 7th and you couldn't come.
PATIENT: I don’t remember all that.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's when they wanted you to come.
PATIENT: But uh could you tell me when they were going to operate on that, you know I want.
DOCTOR: Oh I need you to probably come back and see them.
PATIENT: Can I talk to them today about the operation?
DOCTOR: Today?
PATIENT: Yes I want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Yeah no I think it's an important thing cause we don't know what's going on with your chest pain because you have the heart disease.
PATIENT: I have a heart disease?
DOCTOR: Yeah your heart.  You know that you had a heart attack right?
PATIENT: Yeah in July.
DOCTOR: So that shows that you have like um some clogged arteries in your heart.
PATIENT: Yeah they said they could put some stents in there.
DOCTOR: Yeah they want to take a look at it you know.  Didn't you have stents put in?
PATIENT: Yes ma'am in uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Pardon me (patient takes a phone call).
DOCTOR: I think if we get you admitted today you'll be okay, if we admit you?  Because you shouldn't go around with these chest pains going on.  Can we admit you today?
PATIENT: Okay you can admit me today.
DOCTOR: Yeah let me talk about it.  Let's have you sit up here okay.  Um cause they wanted to admit you back the last time they saw you right?  But you had to handle some financial matters [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I think since you've been having this chest pain, if it's been happening every day, it's pretty much every time you walk half a block right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And so does it occur all the time when you walk or just.
PATIENT: Every now and then now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's not, [REDACTED] not as sharp.
DOCTOR: Not as sharp but it's been going.  You can sit right here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I think it might be a good idea if we just go ahead and admit you, but I'll just go talk to someone to see if we can do that okay. Say ah.  I might have to do an EKG just to see what's going on okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I think that'd be the best thing because they were worried about you last time and we need to put you on the right medications too, okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright deep breath, okay another one.  Another one, good, breath in, good.  Okay can you lay back for me.  So you sleep on about one and a half pillows and that's been like that for a while?
PATIENT: Yes ma'am.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Do you smoke or drink or anything?
PATIENT: No I don't drink and I don't use dope but I smoke.
DOCTOR: You smoke.
PATIENT: Yes ma’am, but I.
DOCTOR: Yeah you should try stopping because that's not good especially since you have, since you had a heart attack.  I want to just look at your legs for the swelling, sorry.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Let me take this shoe off.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'll take this shoe off.
DOCTOR: It's pretty swollen in your feet.
PATIENT: Yeah this foot here.
DOCTOR: Is really swollen.
PATIENT: Well I got hit with a steel [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah and you had fracture a long time ago.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.  Oh.
DOCTOR: You have a little swelling yeah.  It's just a little bit.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] operated on me right here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  So you have swelling okay.  Alright.  I'll have you sit back.  You can put your stuff back on and I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Yes ma'am.
DOCTOR: I might have to put, give you your EKG real quick okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  19:12  DOCTOR IN:  23:23)
DOCTOR: Alright sir.  Can I actually have you wait outside but it'll be a second.  Um we're trying to contact the cardiologist too okay.  So you are willing to get admitted though and I think it's a good idea to do that okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay don't forget your sock.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Dropped your sock yeah.
PATIENT: So you want to admit me?
DOCTOR: Yeah most likely we will okay cause.  The first time you experienced this chest pain was about a little over a few weeks ago, like at the end of December?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So it's been about the same since then right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's when you came into the ER over here right?
PATIENT: Yes uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright just wait out there and then I'll get to see you with.  We have to get you better.
PATIENT: Okay thank you, thank you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yes ma'am.  Okay thank you.
