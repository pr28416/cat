DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Hi.
PATIENT: Hi how are you?
DOCTOR: Come on back sir.  How you doing?
PATIENT: Oh I'm doing alright.  The arthritis, it's a little [REDACTED] to walk after.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's just that I had a little thing that occurred within the last 24 hours with my ankle.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The swelling has gone, basically gone down.
DOCTOR: Great.
PATIENT: Yeah, do I sit here or there?
DOCTOR: Oh it doesn't matter.
PATIENT: If I just take that shoe off, then I got to sit over here.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s fine.
PATIENT: It that's the deal.  Uh, let’s see now.  Basically, you could see [REDACTED] actually.  This one here is normal and this one is a little bit wider.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Do you want to see my feet or?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well I have a pain still though in my toe.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright, these are socks [REDACTED].  Anytime I'm walking I need and these are a little bit swollen right now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well that's one half.
DOCTOR: So that's the spot in here huh?
PATIENT: Right here, it's focusing right up in here somewhere when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I get pain in  here.  Now in the morning just right in here it'll be thinner in the morning that it is now.
DOCTOR: Sort of like swelling yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Have you gone to Podiatry, I forget?
PATIENT: Podiatry?
DOCTOR: Yeah the foot doctors.
PATIENT: No, not at all.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If you can just give me a hand and pull that up, it did swell on me my foot over here on walking because of what happened to me this morning, oh here, my ankles.
DOCTOR: What happened to you?
PATIENT: You tell me.  I’m just trying to get the initial stuff first.  Okay now this one here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You can see the difference here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And this is the way it is, usually at the end of the day, kind of still swollen like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And in the morning this will not be like this, it’ll be...
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Down a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay, now a week and a half ago I got a [REDACTED], should I put these on.
DOCTOR: You leave them off now if you like [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay, okay, good.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh I got a virus, bad virus a week and a half ago.  I was in the Emergency Room.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] get antibiotics for it.  Its congestion and I'm sitting at home for three days on my back, laying on my back.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I don't know if it had something to do with my intake of the amount of juice that I had but I guess I drank 3 1/2 gallons of orange juice and lemonade and I didn't know it has a lot of acid in it and if that's just part of the gout or something.  Maybe I'm wrong about it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And maybe I am so anyhow I get this great pain right in here right through my ankles when I walk, it's like pins.  It just occurred this morning and then also getting a little stiffness in my knees.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it just occurred.  It started like yesterday.  I started sitting at my kitchen table, I felt a little stiffness and then tonight, last night I felt more and then this morning I was like walking like this pins and needles.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Now why were you laying down for so long?
PATIENT: Because of the virus I had, I was lying down.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I was told [REDACTED] that I shouldn't have done, but I didn’t know the difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright so how is your breathing doing?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Do you feel better?
PATIENT: Well my breathing is a little bit heavier now cause I got this virus now, it's just something that occurred.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: In my lungs.
DOCTOR: But are you definitely getting better with that virus you think?
PATIENT: Well I hope so yeah because it was terrible.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean I was coughing up phlegm 50 times a day and now I've coughed up maybe a few times, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fevers or chills?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  You're not feeling real short of breath?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Except when you really exert yourself?
PATIENT: No, well I could sometimes you know if I go from the second floor of steps.  It's just I get the pain.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause when you have pain you have exhaustion so you cough.
DOCTOR: Are you still taking the doxycycline, the antibiotic they gave you?
PATIENT: The what?
DOCTOR: The antibiotic they gave you?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, I got to go four more days on it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I got four more pills.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now I stopped taking the water pills about three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know if I should have done that or not.
DOCTOR: Well how do you think you've been doing since you stopped it?
PATIENT: Well since I stopped it you know, like I said, in the mornings they're thinner than what they are now but you know this stuff's come back every night and it's kind of like this.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: So I don't know what to do and how long is it going on for you what I'm saying you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well I think I'd probably keep you on something.  Um you're taking two tabs by mouth every morning and you were getting 80 twice a day.  I'd probably keep you on, so I think there's a couple of things.  Um you know I think you probably did have some gout which is why you got better with the steroids.  Um and now we have you on colchicine which is another treatment for gout but the thing.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: With steroids is you can only go on it for a short period of time cause it's really bad for you to be on.
PATIENT: Colchicine.
DOCTOR: Colchicine, you're on that now.
PATIENT: Yeah, I got about maybe about eight more tablets, ten more tablets.
DOCTOR: Yeah so.
PATIENT: I shouldn’t use that?
DOCTOR: No I'm saying the steroids.  The prednisone is what you can't be on for a long time.
PATIENT: I don't have no more steroids.
DOCTOR: Yeah so we gave you that for a short period.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Now we have you on colchicine.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um and the question is should we continue you on that for a little while and switched it to a different medicine for the gout.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You're saying this toe here is still hurting you a little?
PATIENT: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If I bend it like this you'll feel it, when I do one of these here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You can feel it kind of from and it goes right up in here.  It's the main bone [REDACTED] from the foot you know and it's kind of the same right here also.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Does it hurt you like just to touch it?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Uh no, no.  A little bit yeah right here.  Now if I press down on this part I will get pain.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Right here uh this one here a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not much.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well I think what we could probably do today is stop the colchicine and switch you to something that you could take.  I think you know it looks like you may have a problem with gout you know over time.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I think allopurinol is the medicine that you can stay on forever to prevent the gout from flaring up again.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The prednisone and the colchicine are kind of short-term medications to use when things are really bad but the allopurinol you can stay on, it should keep that uric acid level down and it should prevent you from getting the flare-ups of your gout.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I think we should probably do that today.
PATIENT: Uh, okay now getting back to the second matter though, this recent thing and like I say in my ankle.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: What causes this?
DOCTOR: Well I don't know but maybe it was because you were not moving around very much for a couple of days and now you're kind of up on your feet again.
PATIENT: Really?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because um see I was moving around in the hospital Tuesday, I had to go to different departments.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It was Tuesday, yeah I think it was Tuesday, I think it was Tuesday.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah and when I went home I was real tired out in my legs.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh fatigued and they were in pain from walking, just walking in the hospital here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I don't think, should that have been because according to my therapist I should be walking more and look at this now you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, well you know it takes some time to get into it so I think you know you should be pushing yourself a little at a time to get back if you can uh but it's not surprising that when you first really get into it that you might have some pain at the end of the day either okay.  So what you want to do is stay active and you know every day kind of push yourself a little bit more but you have to be kind of patient with this okay.  Um I think we should definitely get you into Podiatry because you, despiste, you know even once we get your gout completely taken care of and the fluid, you have pretty beat up feet.
PATIENT: Oh yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay sorry about that.
DOCTOR: So, no it's fine.
PATIENT: This is uh due to a sport, I know my toes [REDACTED] and it's kind of taking up the parking place.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: In the other toes and this one is coming in.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So some of the pain I think may be just related to your, the way your feet are.
PATIENT: And my right one is the bad one.  I have this over here holding cause the toe kind of reaches over the first toe.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Over the big toe.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  So they may be able to help just with some special shoes and.
PATIENT: Oh I've gone to foot doctors before and it's pretty painful what they give you.  I know I was walking on cardboard at one time and it was awful.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean, what I need is surgical where the toe is brought back [REDACTED] this one is.
DOCTOR: I was going to say.
PATIENT: And do this you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah they're the ones that do the surgery too so.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: I went there one time and I did ask about my feet and I did.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And they kind of said no they can't do it.
DOCTOR: Let's send you back and see what they think now okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's not going to hurt anything.
PATIENT: Yeah.  It's just that since the 4th of February I am just up to my neck with going to Hines hospital, coming here so much.  I just came out of a PTSD class.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Which I was taking for like uh two weeks now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I've been coming here and that was out of the medical part and now the mental thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then now.
DOCTOR: Yeah you've had a lot going on lately.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well okay.
PATIENT: And I'd of course like to get something done.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  Well even if, it will take a while for them to get you in.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: I think the next time they see you we'll at least [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Alright oh I see.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh but can you tell me what I have, cause like still with that, it just happened this morning.
DOCTOR: That feeling of the numbness kind of [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The pins in here and I can't, in my ankles, ankles when I walk.
DOCTOR: Has it been there continuously all day?
PATIENT: Yes uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah and do you have numbness and tingling on the bottom of your feet usually?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No okay.  So are you having much pain in general anymore or no?
PATIENT: Uh I get a little stiffness in the knees. When I get going and they loosen up and I got more power in my right leg, the operating knee is better [REDACTED] and power but not recently in the last 24 hours, not since I got this stiffness cause this stiffness also affected my knees too.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, okay.  I don't know exactly.
PATIENT: I don't know I just thought that maybe three gallons of orange juice had something to do with it.
DOCTOR: Well that's a lot of; I wouldn't drink that much orange juice.
PATIENT: Yeah I know that now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah and it does have acid in there right?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Is it part of this I don't know?
DOCTOR: Uh it's hard to say.
PATIENT: Oh I see.
DOCTOR: But I would kind of; it's good to drink water but not so much juice okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Try to drink more just regular water.  You can have a little orange juice but no more than one or two glasses a day okay.
PATIENT: Yeah but I was sick when I was at the house all day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: But yeah I don't know what would cause.  If you have continuous numbness and tingling in your feet then we need to know about it but let's see if it goes away.  I mean I don't know what caused it.
PATIENT: It just occurred now, this thing on the ankle.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So I think we just need to understand what you were doing with the water pills.  So you were taking 80 mg in the morning and 80 at night right?
PATIENT: Yeah I was taking it in the morning and at night.
DOCTOR: And now you're not taking anything?
PATIENT: I didn't take it in the last three days.  One of the reason is cause I got so sick with this virus.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I just couldn't handle all the pills you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I wanted to get this out of me you know so I don't know if that had anything to do with the swelling right now.
DOCTOR: I think what I'd like to do is have, keep you on a small dose of the water pill, less than what you were taking just once a day.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because you know the urination part is irritating after a while you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's quite abundant.
DOCTOR: Sure, sure, okay.  Um okay let me talk to DOCTOR cause I know he was interested with what's going on with your feet last time you were here okay.  So let me listen to your lungs first.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I might need to get something here cause I still got congestion.
DOCTOR: Yeah, take a deep breath.  Okay, you're not a smoker right?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: They didn't do an x-ray of your chest when you went in no?
PATIENT: Oh they took many x-rays of my chest, I think before the operation.
DOCTOR: But not when you were just in the Emergency Room?
PATIENT: Oh no, none.
DOCTOR: Okay let me [REDACTED] DOCTOR take a look at your feet okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: I think that the bursitis in my left arm is getting worse and worse so I'm just kind of living with it.  It's in my left arm right up in here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It bothers me when I'm at rest you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I'll take a look at it when I come back in okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  19:15  DOCTOR IN:  28:31)
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: How been doing there doc?
DOCTOR: I'm well and how are you?  We talked on the phone and DOCTOR told me that you get better but then bounce back.
PATIENT: Exactly, that’s what it seems like.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] Yeah these are pretty worn, I agree.  Yeah I think it's that gout's come back.  I was hoping to keep you off that prednisone but uh we were talking about that.  I think we're going to be putting you back on it uh, so this is going to be a little bit difference however and DOCTOR is going to explain more but uh I do think that this is pretty much gout that's basically causing all these problems.  There are medicines that can help you keep gout flares, gouty flares away and hopefully you won't have to worry about this again but we have to try to go through this stepwise process.
PATIENT: Yeah and it goes with you all your life.  I never had gout since this operation you know eight weeks ago.  What the heck caused it though?
DOCTOR: You know sometimes it does happen where people are predisposed but have never had problems, then something happens, a stressful situation uh whatever that would be uh emotional stress, physical stress, surgery and it kind of flares up so that's a possibility.
PATIENT: And explain to me about the initial thing that happened over the last 24 hours, my ankle right here, oh my God, it's like walking on pins again.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It was like when I those feet blown up real big before.
DOCTOR: Yeah I remember what they were before.
PATIENT: Yeah but this is in the ankle right here and it just happened though, it started last night in the evening.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Is that gout or?
DOCTOR: Well we think it's a combination of gout and fluid in the ankles.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so DOCTOR is going to talk to you a little bit about a couple of medicines that we're going to be putting you on.  Uh you've been on them before albeit now that we kind of have a better idea of what we're dealing with I think we have a better direction of how we're going to handle these medicines so she's going to give you instructions on them.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I see and would you guys maybe follow up on it in a week and a half or so, I can call you.
DOCTOR: Yeah. You can give me a call.
PATIENT: ‘cause I know it's like a month maybe if I see you in between, you know I'm just seeing you.  I mean I don't mind as long as it goes down.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh but it seems like you know they go down in the morning and then in the evening they blow-up again.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I'm just walking.  I'm walking daily but not that much at all.
DOCTOR: I understand.
PATIENT: I mean what does it take for these things to go away?
DOCTOR: We kind of.
PATIENT: I have a question like that you know.
DOCTOR: Well gout is because you have too much of a substance in the body called uric acid, it's a natural substance and some people have more of it than others.  When you have too much of it it tends to crystallize out and it crystallizes out in your feet, especially in your toes and your ankles and that causes inflammation, swelling and pain.  So certain medicines can help drop that uric acid level and that's what DOCTOR is going to talk to you more about.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Alright and then other thing is my injections I used to take, the cortisone in my knee, this one her, I won’t be using that any more because it's new.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But my old knee, I don't know who I talk to about that, Orthopedics or?
DOCTOR: Ortho yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah you do.
DOCTOR: I'd send you to [REDACTED] Ortho.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Really.
DOCTOR: She will make a referral for you to see somebody.
PATIENT: Cause they used to give me injections three times a year and it helped me out walking.
DOCTOR: Actually, yeah so the rheumatologist is who we're going to have you be seen for your gout and also help you with your knee.
DOCTOR: Okay, yeah.
DOCTOR: But uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah this thing flared up because I was here just two days ago I was walking up and down the corridor, I went home and my feet and legs were very tired.  I put them up, it was overnight and this is when they started to get stiff and stiffness in the last 24 hours.
DOCTOR: I think we're to go ahead and give you some medicine top pick up today [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I have another question [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well that's the thing; we probably would do it to keep it going.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Until we get the.
DOCTOR: Just a couple months.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
DOCTOR: And even if you want to bring him back in a month or so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know to check his uric acid and you could certainly test it in another month.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: In order to keep it simple and then prednisone and back next month.
DOCTOR: And then start the allopurinol?
DOCTOR: No I thought we'd go send him home with that since he's been.
DOCTOR: Start right now.
DOCTOR: Yeah have him start it in two weeks.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Check a uric acid level you know and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: I think [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, sounds good.
DOCTOR: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay thank you.  Alright so we're gonna make some changes to your medications okay.  I'm going to write it down for you so you don't get confused.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.  This is what we're gonna do, we're gonna stop the colchicine.
PATIENT: See this here, if I bend my knee right now it feels stiff right in here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Is that also affecting the [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: No the gout's probably, I don't know if any.
PATIENT: Why is the knee getting stiff all of a sudden?
DOCTOR: I don't know.  Let's do one thing at once okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let's try to deal with this gout okay.
PATIENT: Thinking of what I used to do.  I can still take a hot bath or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So the prednisone will probably help with your knee too okay.  And what we're going to do is we're going to, take prednisone, do you want pick it up today or do you want it to come in the mail?
PATIENT: Oh God, oh what time is it now, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's 3:40.
PATIENT: Yeah, I got to make it to a meeting?
DOCTOR: Well you'd probably [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well I thought they were open until around 4:30 or 5, like I say.
DOCTOR: So what do you think do you want to get it at the window?
PATIENT: Yeah I guess so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's all I can do if I don't fall asleep, I'm so tired right now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Got up this morning, running around before I come here, oh boy, I gave myself a little time you know but when you called and came back just sitting.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: It seems like I'm losing energy, somewhat I don't know why.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause when I get up, it's like there's a biochemistry that changed me since this operation.  And I had never been operated on in my whole life and never had anything cut open.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: My body's rejecting this cut open and this was like I didn't even know this was major surgery anyhow.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: A knee replaced.
DOCTOR: Yeah, well we'll get you taken care of.  I think you just have really bad gout and that's probably been a lot of your problems okay.  And a lot of people actually have it and you have a bad case but we'll get it under control so.
PATIENT: Bad case oh.  What about diet, I mean I don't know.  You supposed to, I can't eat red meat or nothing, is this true? Or,
DOCTOR: You know I think.
PATIENT: I had to do with raw meat or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  One second, okay?
PATIENT: I might be running out of hydrocodone.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Probably, I got about ten tablets left and I think I'm having them every three to four hours so I don't know if I should have you – should I still be on it?
DOCTOR: If you need it, that's a pain medicine.
PATIENT: Yeah now I use it, but I think I need it yeah.  I hope I can get any of these, if I can get them at this time and.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah I can refill that for you okay.  So this is, I want to go over the plan okay, one second.  Let me write it down for you so you don't forget.
PATIENT: And then are you going to put in something for me with the foot people, what do you call them, and I'll hear from them in the future.
DOCTOR: Yeah, the podiatrist.
PATIENT: Podiatrist yeah, podiatrist.  They were operated on, I want you to know this, by the other doctor, just the right foot. They just came with the hammertoe
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And everything else got screwed up after him.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: You know, like I'm not going to mention the names.  I mean he's a private doctor in Park Ridge who did it.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: And uh it all happened after him operating on it.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: He used to numb your foot and then I don't know what he did to it, it was numb, right there, you know, you walk off.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And [REDACTED] first move [REDACTED] NAME.
DOCTOR: No it isn't.
PATIENT: Oh I don't see how.  I thought you'd said [REDACTED] NAME.
DOCTOR: That's okay.
PATIENT: I called a couple of times.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Over the years okay.
DOCTOR: Okay this is what I want you to do, okay.  You're gonna take prednisone, you're gonna pick it up right now.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: 40 mg daily for five days.
PATIENT: For five days.
DOCTOR: Which is what you did last time.  The difference is after that we're going to continue you on it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But at 20 mg daily okay.  So then.
PATIENT: I'm now going to be picking both of them up, 40 mg up now?
DOCTOR: It's all going to be 20 mg tabs so for five days you're gonna take two of them.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: And then after that just take one every day.
PATIENT: Oh I see.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We're going to start with new medicine called allopurinol but not for two weeks, okay.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So I want you to start it around May 10th.
PATIENT: May 10th yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Take this first, these two and then take that.
DOCTOR: Continue them you don't stop this one so.
PATIENT: Right yeah.
DOCTOR: But um then start the allopurinol.
PATIENT: I see.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and then the Lasix or furosemide, that's that water pill.
PATIENT: Well I’ve got so many those left.
DOCTOR: I'm not going to give you a new one but I want you to start taking 20 mg daily.
PATIENT: Just one tablet a day.
DOCTOR: One tablet a day.
PATIENT: When's the best time to take it, in the morning or?
DOCTOR: Yeah just morning probably so you don't have to wake up in the night to urinate.
PATIENT: Oh I see.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And I want you to stop the colchicine.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm taking an antibiotic pill too.
DOCTOR: That's okay.
PATIENT: I take one a day.
DOCTOR: That'll be done in a few days okay.
PATIENT: I never took so many pills in my life in one day, and I've got such pills.
DOCTOR: That's the plan okay.
PATIENT: Yeah thank you.
DOCTOR: And call me if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: And I think you're going to feel a lot better in this next week.
PATIENT: Well the last time you gave me those other ones it did clear up quite fast.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you'll feel it again and this time we'll be keeping you on that medicine for a while okay.
PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: And then what we're going to do is uh we're going to send you to the gout specialists okay.
PATIENT: Oh there is a gout specialist?  Oh I see.
DOCTOR: You're going to graduate from me to someone who only deals with really gout.
PATIENT: Oh, what's your percentage healed if this is gout right now?
DOCTOR: It's pretty bad.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So like 90%.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So when will I see them?
DOCTOR: Probably in a couple weeks.
PATIENT: Oh I see.
DOCTOR: So we're going to keep you on that.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And they're going to see you and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You know what that department's called?
DOCTOR: Rheumatology.
PATIENT: Oh Rheumatology, yeah I used to know a doctor, who used to give me injections.
DOCTOR: DOCTOR?  Yeah he's part of that group.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay and I'll see you back in five weeks the next time and then we'll see how you're doing then okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  Well thank you doc.
DOCTOR: We're making progress, it's slow but we're getting there huh.
PATIENT: Well I hope so.  Yeah it was just this flare-up that got me.  It wasn't for the ankle, the flare-up that got me this morning.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'd be alright; I talked to a companion of mine this morning and I said oh my God what's happening to me now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know I said here I said I'm walking like this and I'm feeling kind of pins in it you know.
