DOCTOR: No just a lot of patients today.
PATIENT: Yeah I know that.
DOCTOR: How are you feeling?
PATIENT: I've been okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah but it's like they're trying to make me be sick though man.
DOCTOR: Oh because of the lung thing?
PATIENT: Oh man, it's going in my bladder, down they go and then it goes in my lungs.  They go as far as they could see.  What'd they say they see?
DOCTOR: They talked to your daughter right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think that's what they did.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What'd your daughter think.
PATIENT: Yeah they.
DOCTOR: Cause I got a message that you wanted me to call your daughter.
PATIENT: Yeah she wanted to talk to you too.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah okay.

DOCTOR: Is she home right now?  I could call her right now with it.
PATIENT: No she uh she's busy at school.  She a schoolteacher.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: So you have to catch her off school.
DOCTOR: Okay.

PATIENT: Yeah, that's something like that.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What do you understand about everything that's going on?
PATIENT: I don't know, that's why I wanted to see you.  You tell me what to do.  I had and they tell me and I just told them to set up an appointment for me to come here and uh on the 29th I've got to have this head scan or what they doing for the head and uh.
DOCTOR: The 29th of uh.
PATIENT: This month, this month.
DOCTOR: An MRI.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: What's this doing?  Then next she called me and said I need to make the appointment to do this biopsy.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And that one's the next month.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it is.
PATIENT: And they put this up to you and I had this special ladder, even when I get up to the steps.  I don't know what they trying to do to me, what do you think?
DOCTOR: Well it's because they saw this thing in your, in your lungs.
PATIENT: Yeah it's been there a long time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's what they told me, we been checking it for a long time but now they said it moved some or something.
DOCTOR: So when we got this other one in July, you know to follow up, it said you had a 2 x 1 cm sized mass in the right upper lobe of your lung.  So the top part of your right lung.  This was new since previous exams uh and then that's when they recommended that maybe you needed a PET scan which is another CT scan.
PATIENT: Yeah I said I'd go up for that.
DOCTOR: Um I don't think they noticed this before that time.
PATIENT: Yeah it's been since, that's been since 95, 96, it's been a long time.  That gentleman was checking it all the time.  Check me one time it was six months then they went to a year to check it.
DOCTOR: Is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But they're saying that it wasn't there before.
PATIENT: Yeah it's been there since 96, 95 I think DOCTOR started checking that out.
DOCTOR: Here at the VA?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I told them that uh to go back and it's been there but then they said it moved or something or other.
DOCTOR: Uh they're saying it's new because it's moved.
PATIENT: Yeah it moved or something but no we've been checking that for a long time.  It's been there and what not.
DOCTOR: And I read their note cause this is beyond me you know.
PATIENT: It is?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  These are people that, if there's something they see that's abnormal they take control and so it's uh a cancer doctor DOCTOR and lung doctor, DOCTOR you'll see them.
PATIENT: Yeah man we [REDACTED] I'm on my last leg or something.  Gee whiz, a guy, you could let your daughters know, your children know and boom, boom, boom, like huh?  And I just kept quiet.  Why do they want to talk to the doctor, she called me and she called me.
DOCTOR: July 19th is when they first talked about it.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Man.  It's when they went into my [REDACTED] July 19 I'm thinking.  Then they send me to X-Ray.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Then they saw something in the x-ray and send me to CAT scan and then they saw something then it wasn't nothing they could reach then they send me out to the other place out in Hinesdale to it was a.
DOCTOR: A PET scan.
PATIENT: PET scan and showed more then I go and take this breathing thing for the you know here and.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's what happened so, you had it before but now it's bigger.  That's what it is.  So even though it was slow it's gotten bigger and that's what concerned them.  I'm reading it right now.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And they wanted to talk about it but imaging was reviewed, you used to smoke.
PATIENT: Yeah a long time ago.
DOCTOR: A CT scan of July just to look at it and they saw the 2 x 1 cm mass.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Then they compared it to a CT imagining back in 2005.
PATIENT: Yeah what's way, back in 2005.
DOCTOR: And looking back at it, it was present.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But now it's bigger and that's what worries him, that it grew, why did it grow.  If it was stable it wouldn't have grown that much, that's why.
PATIENT: Yeah but what would make it grow?
DOCTOR: But that's what they're worried that if it's a malignant cancer that's the only reason something like that would grow.
PATIENT: But shouldn't I have some kind of symptom or something you know to.
DOCTOR: True, no you're right.  You would be weak and would have probably more of a cough.  You'd probably feel you know like you're not gaining weight.  Let me look at your weight.
PATIENT: No and I know what, I know the weight change, I know what's wrong with the weight.
DOCTOR: You've lost weight or you've gained weight?
PATIENT: I've lost weight.  I knew this.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But doc see, I know I weighed 160-165 the most but I'm trying to get, my weight is 150-55.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: See but I, after some years I got older I kept gaining a little more weight so like where I can stay home more and eat more but now I'm trying to get on, see the number on my pants is 34.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm down to 34 just about.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I got to be around 160, I used to be 160-165.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: To be my 34.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I could talk to your daughter and I'll try to call her like in the afternoons.  It's kind of hard for me to call in the afternoon but.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: But, so they're saying that this could be consistent with cancer and that's why they wanted to get the PET scan to see if it's spreading and the PET scan that â€“ showed them that you have some findings also in the middle of your chest, not just on the right and something right over your kidneys.  That doesn't mean that you have the cancer but there's sure something there.  So at this point they feel that the only way they can confirm if it's cancer or not is to get a sample of it.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: So that's what they're recommending to you.  That's when you know DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And he told you that he recommended the biopsy.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you agreed right?
PATIENT: Right, right, you know it doesn't matter to me cause I just had, I have no kind of symptom but you know I rest through it and like I say when I said, when I gained weight like past the 160 or 65 you know I get very short then.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know.
PATIENT: And it was like uh I can't carry a lot of weight cause I get it up here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then so I can't carry weight up here.
DOCTOR: So I think it's worth investigating.  You know obviously you already said yes.
PATIENT: Yeah I already said yes, yeah I did.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I just apologize if it felt like they were telling you you're on your last leg.  I really don't want you to feel like that.
PATIENT: Oh no, I just but he just talk, you know he.
DOCTOR: I think they just wanted to let your family know.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then, just so they could be ready.  It could be nothing, it could be something.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But information, I think that's what it is.  Maybe that's what DOCTOR wanted to say, just let your family know.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: You know, just so they know because the next thing you know if something does happen why were they doing this, why did this happen?
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think that's all it is.  I think he just wants your daughter to know everything that's going on.
PATIENT: I think she talked to DOCTOR about it already.
DOCTOR: Yeah he did but she also wanted to talk to me about it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I'll try to call her today or tomorrow.
PATIENT: Hmm.  Yeah you can call her anytime but she's home for sure if you call her in the afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay well then what we'll do is - and this biopsy is scheduled for when do you know?
PATIENT: The 11th of September.
DOCTOR: The 11th of September.
PATIENT: Yeah I just talked with the nurse yeah what I got to do.
DOCTOR: And you're on Coumadin right?
PATIENT: Yeah she got to get it through the [REDACTED] you know when they take me off from the Coumadin.
DOCTOR: Maybe we'll start a Lovenox injections.  That way you wouldn't have to get admitted to the hospital.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Because you know when you're on Warfarin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You have to stop it.
PATIENT: What.
DOCTOR: We still have to give you medications so you won't clot.
PATIENT: But they said I might take it before the.
DOCTOR: So the urologist did the.
PATIENT: No for the, no for the um [REDACTED] for the [REDACTED].  They just took me off, I didn't take nothing.  They haven't put me on nothing.
DOCTOR: Oh you didn't switch, is this for afib?
PATIENT: You just took me off for the six days.
DOCTOR: And he didn't give you injections or anything?
PATIENT: No they don't give me nothing.
DOCTOR: Let me see.  Let me look in my old notes.  It's only because of your heart.  You're heart, your irregular rhythm.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: That's why you're on Coumadin.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what happened.
DOCTOR: That was because of clots back in the day right.
PATIENT: Oh no, no, no, that was for the since they found out I had an irregular heartbeat.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay so he [REDACTED] to come off.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what he said except for days within that date, they might have to give me the shots or something like that.  I said well [REDACTED] before you don't give me nothing and I was off for six days.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So they had put me to sleep for this and that.  They gave me anesthesia and all that stuff.
DOCTOR: So how you doing with the?
PATIENT: Prostate.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Sure not a thing.
DOCTOR: You're doing okay and your voiding trial was okay right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah alright.  Your blood pressure.
PATIENT: It high.
DOCTOR: Alright stay right there, don't move.
PATIENT: Now that ain't got nothing with the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: And you've been taking all your medications today?
PATIENT: Yeah and then we know what it takes.
DOCTOR: Move your legs.
PATIENT: You know I only take the lisinopril once a day, 30.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah I woke up this morning and that's what I take this morning.
DOCTOR: And you took it this morning right?
PATIENT: Yeah before I took my medicine.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it was 180 something over 1 something.
DOCTOR: And did you um, you didn't change your medications.  You've been on this for a while right?
PATIENT: Yeah the lisinopril [REDACTED] from the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright.  Just relax.  Alright. Itâ€™s high.
PATIENT: Now it's 200 huh?
DOCTOR: Yeah it's like 160.
PATIENT: Oh then it's gone down some, it was 181 or 182 when she was taking.  It was 180 something before I took it before I took my medicine.  I took it in the morning around 9 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It goes like that.  So then it goes all the way till it gets numb.  [REDACTED] keep looking.  Anyway I took it again it'd be down to like 130 and then 130, 120 and sometime I take it it'll be 160.  Take my meds and it'll go down to 140, 130.  It's gone down some already cause it was 187 when she took it.
DOCTOR: Let's see what I got for you last time.  We've been battling this.
PATIENT: Yeah.  [REDACTED] changing medicine, then after a while you've check it later on so it went down.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 30 mg right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And when I took it then it was 120-128.
PATIENT: Yeah.  So what should I do?
DOCTOR: You been checking it at home?
PATIENT: I check it at home every so often.  I get tired [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And what was it like?
PATIENT: Oh I didn't check for a while.  I been here, like I said sometimes I get up before I take the medicine it's 160 or 170 or something like that.  I take my medicine and about three hours later check it and it's down to 140, 130, 134 stuff like that and if I stay around long enough it goes down to 128 and stuff like that.  So actually it's kind of a weird. I said the hell with it.  Like I said the only time I feel bad is when it goes below 120.  When it go down like in the 105 and stuff like that then I get a little off balance but other than that I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Oh your blood pressure was high even before the operation.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Before the surgery they did, that what they do.
DOCTOR: Were on hydrochlorothiazide before?
PATIENT: Uh some time ago yeah, yeah they took me off of that stuff.  It was going too low at night; it was going down to the 80s.  Yeah going down to 80s yeah take me off the meds man.  It'd get me kind of woozy at night, off balance.  During daytime or like nighttime.
DOCTOR: I think we might have to go back up on your lisinopril.
PATIENT: I, they at 30.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah what is that 10, 20, then they got 30.
DOCTOR: So the lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, both continue b.i.d. [REDACTED]
PATIENT: And they changed my urine type medicine, the prostate cause we just had too much.
DOCTOR: Who stopped your hydrochlorothiazide?  I did?
PATIENT: Yeah.  You stopped that and you changed my prostate medicine here for the urine tract.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You got that stopped, you changed that too.  That's when I had to go back to GU cause it started interfering with my tract so I went back to GU.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.
PATIENT: They put me on something.
DOCTOR: I think, let me see what I'm gonna do alright, I'll be back.
