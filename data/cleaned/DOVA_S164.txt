DOCTOR: Well they checked your lungs for emphysema in 2006 and it looks like you had emphysema.
PATIENT: Oh I did.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So.
PATIENT: They didn't tell me.
DOCTOR: I think what we're seeing a little bit now is emphysema.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Sounds like we gotta get you tuned up okay.  I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: You gotta get me tuned up?
DOCTOR: Yeah we're going to tune you up like a car, so we'll treat you better, I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  46:57  DOCTOR IN:  57:33)
DOCTOR: Okay.  I was talking to DOCTOR, he's my attending okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you have to; I think what's going on with you more than anything is what we call and exacerbation of emphysema.  When they looked at your lungs in 2006, you had emphysema.  Do you know what emphysema is?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Emphysema is when people who smoke all their life, even though you quit a couple years ago your lungs don't work as well and they start trapping air and you have a hard time getting air out.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And um when you start having productive sputum like you're having with shortness of breath you can get an exacerbation of COPD and I think that's what we're seeing with you.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So there’s a goal to treating that, number one when I listen to you I don't hear pneumonia but given that you've had a lot going on.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I want you to get a chest x-ray on the way out.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: If there’s an abnormality, I will call you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'm still going to give you it's for part of COPD exacerbations,
what works well is I want to try giving antibiotics for five days.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's called azithromycin okay.  I'll also want to give you um, who gives you your medications at home?
PATIENT: I take them myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're pretty good about your medications?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay so, the antibiotic is going to be and these will all be in the instructions, its two pills the first day and then one pill the next four days okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The steroid is going to be similar, what I'm gonna do is I'm going to give you some steroids to decrease the inflammation in your lungs.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: This other stuff, have you ever been on steroids before?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Steroids have side effects okay.  Usually in the short term there are not that many side effects.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: But sometimes people can get a little anxious.
PATIENT: You’re right.
DOCTOR: And can cause some confusion and it can cause your blood sugar to go higher.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But it's gonna really help with your breathing I think.
PATIENT: That's good.
DOCTOR: It's a 9-day course where the first two days you take four pills, the next three days you take you know two pills, the next three days you take one pill.  It will all be on the instructions.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You take all of them and taper off, does that make sense?
PATIENT: That makes sense.
DOCTOR: And then I'm gonna start you on inhalers.  And inhalers are to help you breathe better.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you take two puffs of this inhaler every six hours and it's should open up your breathing a little bit.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So we're doing three medications, steroid, antibiotic and inhaler and you're getting a chest x-ray on the way out.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You normally see DOCTOR.  He's your primary doctor.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: And I think it's time you see him again for follow-up.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You've had problems like this in the past.  DOCTOR we need to have you back within three or four weeks okay.  Now if you’re home and you're not doing better, the fevers persist and your breathing becomes harder, you got to come back to the Emergency Room.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You can stop at the X-ray today okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, okay.
DOCTOR: And the Pharmacy today to pick up all the medicines I'm putting through.  Probably get your x-rays first to give the Pharmacy time to fill the medications.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you'll take the steroids today, the antibiotic today and start using the inhalers today.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Do you have questions for me?
PATIENT: No, no.  All the instructions will be on the bottle, I might forget.
DOCTOR: Yep and [REDACTED] don't be shy to have your family help you out okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause this is a lot of new medications.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: The steroid might make your blood sugars go higher so keep checking your blood sugars and if they get high you have to call us and let us know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I’m DOCTOR [REDACTED].  Just, I don't [REDACTED] so I'll give you an appointment card.  DOCTOR [REDACTED] doctor.
