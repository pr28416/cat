DOCTOR: PATIENT.  Hi PATIENT, sorry to keep you waiting.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  From 2 o'clock I had [REDACTED].  I'm sorry to keep you waiting.  You can have a seat there, wherever you're comfortable.  How you doing?
PATIENT: Doing good.
DOCTOR: I haven't seen you in a while.  Let's see here.  That's good.  So I saw you back in October.  Your sugars were like 110 at that time.
PATIENT: Well I don't know.  I went to the blood section.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: They said I wasn't list for a blood draw today.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let's see what happened there.  You know what happened, did you see somebody else?  I'm sure [REDACTED] this.
PATIENT: I come here, another doctor or something?
DOCTOR: Yeah did you go to Urgent Care?  Did they do labs on you at some point or the other in May?
PATIENT: Uh uh.  Only one I saw today was the lady gave me this for a survey.
DOCTOR: Oh really.  Okay yeah.  Cause you know sometimes when you go to and somebody orders labs on you it makes the labs that we ordered last time go away so we can get them on the way out and maybe I can just give you a phone call.  Is that okay?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Let you know if they're alright okay.  Let me check we have the right number for you.  It's NUMBER?
PATIENT: NUMBER.
DOCTOR: That's right okay.  Well how you doing?
PATIENT: I'm doing fine.
DOCTOR: Yeah, any complaints or anything uh bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any difficulty taking your medications?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay so I got you, looks like on a baby aspirin.  You taking the Aspart?  The insulin?
PATIENT: Uh I'm taking, what is Aspart for?
DOCTOR: So Aspart is NovoLog.  It's NovoLog; it's a quick insulin you take that with meals.  Are you taking that?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had that for months.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you taking any insulin?
PATIENT: The what?
DOCTOR: Are you taking any insulin shots at home?
PATIENT: What kind?
DOCTOR: Insulin.  Do you take shots in your tummy?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Every day.
DOCTOR: Every day.  How many times a day do you take insulin?
PATIENT: One.
DOCTOR: Just one at night?
PATIENT: In the morning.
DOCTOR: In the morning.  Okay is that the Glargine?  Do you remember what it's called?
PATIENT: Glargine.
DOCTOR: The Glargine okay.  Okay and then we have you on lisinopril.  Aside from the aspirin, the lisinopril and the insulin are you taking any other medications?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So that's what.
PATIENT: Well I went, excuse me; I went to the podiatrist last week.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I have uh antifungal cream.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: For my toes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And some uh [REDACTED] I think they call it.
DOCTOR: What do they call it?
PATIENT: Benzizene or.
DOCTOR: Oh I see.
PATIENT: Benadrine.
DOCTOR: Let me see what they gave you.
PATIENT: It's an iodine so it's an.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's just to kind of keep it clean so you don't get an ulcer there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So have you been taking your sugars at home?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: What have they been running?
PATIENT: Oh it has been 130s, 140s.
DOCTOR: Okay well that's pretty good, that's pretty good.  80 to 120 is perfect right when you wake up in the morning.
PATIENT: You know you can't get the perfect score.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Someday I'll feel like eating just a little bit and some days I gorge myself.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's true, that's true.  So who's following your prostate cancer?
PATIENT: What you mean um?
DOCTOR: Is anybody following your prostate cancer?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you go to the doctor for that?
PATIENT: Yeah I was with the [REDACTED] about two weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Good, good, good, good.  Um any trouble with back pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any bone pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any trouble holding your bladder?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No okay.  Any trouble with dribbling or hesitancy?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Anything like that or burning pain?
PATIENT: No.  It will really be on the mild side if I'm not near the toilet.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] run upstairs.
DOCTOR: Um alright.  How many times a night are you going to the bathroom?  Do get woken from sleep quite a bit or?
PATIENT: About two or three.
DOCTOR: Okay that's not awful.
PATIENT: No.  I think it depends on how much water I drink.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  Um.
PATIENT: I try to have water to drink.  I never have been.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm trying to drink more water but then uh then I drink a lot of water and youâ€™re out.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And you have the urge to urinate there's no place to urinate.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's true.  Usually uh you know you're supposed to drink a few 8 oz glasses, sometimes people say a few 12 oz glasses.  Drink when you're thirsty you know.  That's the most important thing.
PATIENT: Well they recommend six to eight glasses per day.
DOCTOR: Right.  Yeah.
PATIENT: I can't drink that much water.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I've never been able to drink that much water.  It's I don't have the urge for it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, well that's okay.  Any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any trouble swallowing, pain on swallowing?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay any um nausea, vomiting?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Diarrhea.  Are you moving your bowels okay?
PATIENT: They move okay.
DOCTOR: Blood in the stool or dark tarry stools?  Any dark tar in your stools or any gross blood in your stool when you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So have you ever had a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: A what?
DOCTOR: A colonoscopy.  I think you had one earlier you told me you had one at Stroger last time right?
PATIENT: I had one a couple of years ago at the County when I was going over there.
DOCTOR: At the County okay.
PATIENT: Very unpleasant procedure.
DOCTOR: Oh was it, I'm sorry to hear that.  Usually they dope you up pretty good.  Usually the worst part is getting cleared.  You know the stuff you drink the night before.  So most my experience is now I hear they'll give you something that's kind of like.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You call it like you know its Versed; it's kind of like a medication that can make you not remember, so it can be people just don't know if it's unpleasant, which is good.  You're up-to-date it looks like so that'll probably be the last one you have unless you start really having problems.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um other than that um what we'll do is we'll look at your A1c, which is a good index for the diabetes and it tells us how much sugar is sticking to those red blood cells and that tells me what your sugars have been like.  Cause you can check it once a day you know but that doesn't tell me what it's like every other time during the day.  Do you typically check it in the morning?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  Um did somebody stop the other insulin?  Did they tell you not to take insulin with meals at some point or did you just stop taking the insulin with meals?  Do you remember?
PATIENT: I don't know what one thing I had when they test my blood, test my fingers.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: After a while it's so sore.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I tried to test my forearm but I can't seem to do it.
DOCTOR: Because the little capillaries in your fingers, look at how red my fingers are and how quick they blanch and you know but the blood flow there is very good so you can, with a real teeny, tiny stick get a lot of superficial blood vessels so your bleeding would be from there.  That's why we tell you to test your fingers.  If you've been on this regimen for a while I have no problem with you testing your sugars maybe like twice a week.  I want to see one daily written where you have more than one value two hour value after the biggest meal.  That's, depending on the kind of diabetes you have and your onset of diabetes, sometimes people have a hard time.
PATIENT: I have a question.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] and some people have a hard time.
PATIENT: Might be silly.
DOCTOR: No its okay.
PATIENT: Have they found any new way to take insulin besides the injections?
DOCTOR: Oh yeah there's billions of them.  They have insulin pens, they have insulin pumps, they have all this other stuff.  But we got to get you on a regimen that works.
PATIENT: Well I wouldn't need anything like a pump I don't think.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: I think that's for a very severe case.
DOCTOR: You're right, you're right.  You're barely on any treatment to be honest so I think that shots are probably the best way to go for you at this point, you know.  Now did you ever take metformin?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Did you ever have any trouble with it?
PATIENT: Well after on a account that they withdrew it from the market.
DOCTOR: No, it's still on the market.
PATIENT: Well you know from the pharmaceutical.
DOCTOR: From the formulary then?  You mean like they didn't have it in the.
PATIENT: And that's been quite a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see here.  Kidney function's okay.  Metformin's a really good drug um.
PATIENT: Yeah but they probably have side effects, that's not good.
DOCTOR: I haven't seen any side effects with that one.  If you look on the internet it'll really freak you out.  You know there's side effects for everything there um but in reality what we see.  Well let's just stay the course now with this insulin.  Let me see what your A1c is today and um kidney function is today.  We'll take a little blood and ask you to pee in the cup on your way out and then we'll make sure.
PATIENT: Okay but what does the metformin do?  You take insulin and you take metformin also?
DOCTOR: You can take those together yeah.  So what insulin does is it replaces what your body doesn't have.  That's the problem with diabetes you're just not making enough insulin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: What the metformin does is it makes the tissues that sugar and insulin go to more responsive to them.  So the problem with type 2 diabetes is you know you have your whole life to high levels of sugar relatively so your tissues, meaning your muscles, your liver, all the places that store calories for energy, store sugar energy kind of stop listening you know.  Sugar would be around and it just wouldn't pay attention to it because itâ€™s so used to it.  So what metformin does is it helps make those tissues more aware of the sugar there so you can put it away.  So insulin makes you gain weight.  Most of the things we treat diabetes with makes you gain weight and that's part of the problem is it can make you gain weight.
PATIENT: Well I tell you what; they withdrew me off of it at the County.
DOCTOR: I don't know, I don't know.  Sometimes if your kidney function gets a little high then we take people off of it but yours isn't terrible so um.  You know let's see, before we make any changes let's see what your labs look like and if we think metformin is a good idea.  Did you have any trouble with it, get diarrhea or anything?
PATIENT: I can't really tell.
DOCTOR: You can't really tell okay.  Okay.
PATIENT: I didn't feel no funny feeling on it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know any, any feeling from it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Maybe there was, I just probably didn't know it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Notice it.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Well yeah we can see what needs to change in today when we get the lab.  Um anything else?
PATIENT: That's all that I need.  I have a lot of syringes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: About a month ago they sent me four boxes of syringes from here.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: I couldn't believe that.
DOCTOR: That's weird.
PATIENT: All that I needed, I got just one vial of the Glargine left.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And the test strips, that's all I need.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: I've got everything else.
DOCTOR: You have everything else.  Do you want them sent to your house or do you want to pick them up today?
PATIENT: I could pick it up today.
DOCTOR: Okay I can do that right now.  We're gonna make sure you have enough refills.  So then see me in six months again and maybe I can give you a call next Tuesday.  We'll talk about the labs and kind of what things to tweak okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Do you know what things to look for if your sugar is low?  Do you know what things, what happens if your sugars get dangerously low?
PATIENT: I've had occasions where it got too low.
DOCTOR: What'd you feel like?
PATIENT: Oh oh bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I was slated to go to Houston for a week's vacation with some friends of mine but I was sick before I left but I just ignored it and got on a plane, I felt bad and I got to Houston.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh I was out of the bed.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I felt some medic slapping me on my face to wake me up.
DOCTOR: Really.  Oh man you passed out.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's even worse.
PATIENT: Yeah the next day I was sort disorientated.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Almost got run over by a car I was walking to a McDonalds across the street.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: But they took me to the hospital and I stayed there for about six or seven days.  They got the blood sugar under control plus a whopping big bill.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm sure.  Um what was important is that you know what it feels like when your sugars get real low.
PATIENT: Oh its weak, disorientated.
DOCTOR: You get sweaty, disoriented, weak.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I couldn't seem to get nothing going.
DOCTOR: Nervous, [REDACTED].  Yeah.  Sometimes people get belligerent.  You hear patients sometimes that you know cops stopping people and thinking they're drugged.
PATIENT: That's the only time I felt that, the hypoglycemia.
DOCTOR: Hypoglycemia okay.  Well it's important to recognize it you know.  Of course you're not glad you went through that but I'm glad you know what to look out for.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You know and it's only, we don't like diabetics eating candy or whatever but it's always okay to keep a little bit of sugar handy in your pocket you know just in case you start to feel like that.  We're not messing with your insulin dose or anything like that today so it shouldn't be a problem okay.  So you went to the podiatrist last week.  Are you getting your eyes checked?
PATIENT: Uh they never called me.  It's been quite a while.
DOCTOR: Let me see here.
PATIENT: They were supposed to have notified me, the doctor said that I hadn't been called.
DOCTOR: Call them then.
PATIENT: See I may have a touch of glaucoma.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Yeah.  That's okay; a lot of people have a little bit of that um.  Last time they saw you they said yeah, they saw you last July it looks like so it hasn't quite been a year.  So you can call up there and they said you're right, glaucoma suspect.  Good and then they wanted you to follow up.  So maybe give them a buzz up there um or I can ask them to make you an appointment right now on your sheet.  I don't need to write you a referral or anything cause they've seen you within a year.  You know I can, so yeah it's a good idea to go to them.  I can make it like in two weeks and you're gonna see me in six months.  Let me just take a look at you.  Okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I have to call them or are they gonna call me?
DOCTOR: Well let's go, usually what we can do is go up to the front and and make an appointment on the way out.  You know at the front desk and then they can send you one.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay just look right up in front at me.  Okay say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Ah good.  Did you have a nice holiday?  Did you do anything for Memorial Day?
PATIENT: Do what?
DOCTOR: Did you do anything for Memorial Day?  Did you cook out or?
PATIENT: Oh I went to a little picnic like the whole day.
DOCTOR: Oh that's nice.  It was hot though wasn't it?  It was warm.  Good.  Alright usually with diabetics I look at your feet, but you just said you went to the podiatrist last week so I won't make you take those all those off.
PATIENT: I have one problem.
DOCTOR: What's that?
PATIENT: When I went to the Podiatry Clinic last week.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They said next time I come there they gonna put a little thing on my leg to check that the circulation in my left leg.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: Wasn't good and I have something else I notice I get a, something like that that don't come off and I got a scab here.  Somehow it came off.
DOCTOR: Huh.  It comes off?
PATIENT: It doesn't seem to heal.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  See it looks almost.
PATIENT: That's why giving me, put aloe vera on it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It stays on.
DOCTOR: Does it itch?
PATIENT: No it don't.
DOCTOR: It doesn't itch.
PATIENT: I got no feeling from it.
DOCTOR: Doesn't hurt?  It looks like.
PATIENT: I've been told that if you have poor circulation.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh uh things don't heal so well.
DOCTOR: Yeah but usually with people with poor circulation you expect to see it at the foot and not up on the calf because the arteries get smaller and smaller is the reason.  But up here, I don't think we can attribute that that far up.
PATIENT: I've had this for a long time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So.  It's no pain or anything just, it's just there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Does it get bigger?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Does it get bigger or stay put?
PATIENT: It's like I don't even know how I got it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I can't remember getting a abrasion or anything like a cut.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  To be completely honest with you I don't know what that is.  For a minute I thought it was eczema you know cause the way the edges are kind of and the way there's a little bit of scabbing.  Sometimes the red blood cells you can see them come on the outside and you get this like kind of speckle of eczema but the [REDACTED] of eczema is itching and yours doesn't itch so it's probably not eczema.  Um you're dark-skinned enough so I'm not worried about cancer or anything like that you know um but there's some sort of cancer cause it is a little dark in there.  I don't know, I think DOCTOR will check it.  Um but for now you know I'm glad it doesn't hurt or it doesn't itch cause I could give you cream for it.
PATIENT: Okay would I go back to the Podiatry Clinic and maybe.
DOCTOR: You know this is more of a dermatology issue though.  This isn't really.
PATIENT: I'll find out why it's like that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And they say, this leg doesn't have good circulation in the right leg.
DOCTOR: That one does okay.  Okay.  Are you a smoker?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  Let me take a listen to your heart here.  Uh I will call DOCTOR in to take a look cause honestly I donâ€™t know.  Deep, good, deep breath again good.  Okay and you can just breathe normally.  Okay.  I'll be back in a second.  So I put the um Glargine and we'll get you an appointment for following up with me in six months.  I sent you the Glargine and then you said you needed the strips so we'll send those out.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We'll ask you to stop by the Lab today to take a look at everything okay.  I'll be back in just a second.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  39:12  DOCTOR IN:  43:42)
DOCTOR: Hello.
PATIENT: Oh hi doc.
DOCTOR: Hi. [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah it's right here.
DOCTOR: Yeah it doesn't blanch.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Why don't we put some [REDACTED] you know something.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Maybe I could take a knife and just cut it off.
DOCTOR: Oh no.  You could try, [REDACTED] that too.
DOCTOR: I understand.
DOCTOR: Well we'll put some steroid cream on it.
DOCTOR: Yeah it doesn't look like normal [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you.
DOCTOR: No problem.
DOCTOR: Alright so your medications are coming to your house or you're picking them up at the window.
PATIENT: Okay now on eye, do I call them or are they gonna call me?
DOCTOR: Usually, I don't know how it works.  Usually you go up there and get a number right?  Is that right?
PATIENT: Well I'll call them and find out if they have me listed for any kind of future appointment.
DOCTOR: Are talking the medicine or are we talking appointments?
PATIENT: Talking about appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: For the eyes.
DOCTOR: For the eye doctor, oh yeah.  For them you can go up there and say I need an appointment with the eye doctor in two weeks.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So right when you get out of here I would go right to the left, make that appointment, an appointment with me, I'd like to see you in six months if that's okay any sooner if needed of course but they'll send you a letter.  And then the Pharmacy's over there and you'll have your Glargine, your strips and I'm going to give you triamcinolone ointment.
PATIENT: Well you want me to go to give the blood.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And get the uh eye appointment.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah it doesn't matter what order you go in, doesn't matter to me but the important thing was the triamcinolone.  I'm gonna give you the ointment, cause it's a little oilier, it's more potent.  You need very little.  Just put it on a real thin film like that twice a day.  Don't put it on your face.  Don't put it on any babies but just keep it right there on the leg cause it's a pretty potent steroid okay.  And just do it until that goes away.  Okay no you're right, you were gonna say, we'll ask you to go to the Lab.  Do those three things in any order you want.  Sounds good?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Any questions for me?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I got to find that lady.
DOCTOR: Oh let's see the last time it looks like your cholesterol was excellent alright.  Let's put all these in before I forget okay.  Now you're not on anything for cholesterol so I'm not gonna check it cause it was good last year and we don't need to check it every six months okay.  Sounds good?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Okay well thank you doctor.
DOCTOR: You're free.  Okay thanks for seeing me and don't for that, so where are you going now?
PATIENT: The Pharmacy to pick up the medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay what's the other thing you're gonna do?
PATIENT: You want me to get the blood draw too.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh and then what's the third thing?  Remember?
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: It's the appointment, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.  Do that.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll see.
PATIENT: Hope I can find that lady for this.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm sure.  You can give this thing to maybe the lady.
PATIENT: She'll be sitting on the outside.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: 47:32
