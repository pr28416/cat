DOCTOR: Do you take your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And what do you usually get?
PATIENT: 125 to 130.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We’re going to run over to [REDACTED].  So how you been feeling since the last time I saw you?
PATIENT: Um good.  Except for the sugars.
DOCTOR: Still high?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How high?
PATIENT: Well 240s, 260s and I'm taking 3 something the other day, I'm taking the uh 60s.  Well I've gone up to 65 of the Glargine, in the evening? And it still be 200, when I wake up.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] that.
PATIENT: Yeah I always do that.  Just like the mornings, this morning it was, that's what it's been, [REDACTED] 163.  And I get, I used to get 5 units of Aspart.
DOCTOR: So you were on 5 units three times a day and 65 units of Glargine?
PATIENT: But she had me on 60 units of Glargine but they told me if it didn't do any good or go down in the morning go up to 65.
DOCTOR: What we could do if you don’t get…
PATIENT: It's not getting it done.
DOCTOR: No [REDACTED].  Okay let's see.  That's not too good, not too good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] my sugars were better.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So then when did you start the 65?
PATIENT: Well now a week ago.
DOCTOR: And you started on 5 units of Aspart.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Before meals?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Three times a day?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And did you notice improvement in your sugars after you had gone up to 65?  Or was it still the same thing?
PATIENT: The same thing. After I eat dinner, around 6:30, 7 o'clock I'm not eating anything.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: When I'm waking up [REDACTED] 260 you know, 240.
DOCTOR: Have you been peeing a lot?
PATIENT: Oh yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Have you been real thirsty?
PATIENT: No, not real thirsty.  When I wake up in the night I be thirsty.
DOCTOR: Any chest pain, fever, chills?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No trouble breathing?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: What about trying to, I mean obviously this does not, you know, help [REDACTED] but what about exercise?
PATIENT: Yeah I try; I mean I try to walk a little bit yeah.  I might get on the treadmill and I might do seven minutes.  I know that ain't nothing but it's something.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]  I mean I don't expect you to run a marathon.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Now what happens?  Do you get real tired with that?
PATIENT: Oh I don't get tired that quick but my hip.  I guess it's because it's not used you know.
DOCTOR: What about when you take Tylenol does that help?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You don't want to take Tylenol?
PATIENT: Oh I have enough [REDACTED] yeah [REDACTED] you know if it's just from me not doing exercise.
DOCTOR: The problem is as we get older we'll get arthritis too, right.
PATIENT: I know I got that, especially here you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah so you know when your hip starts hurting, take the Tylenol before, before [REDACTED] during, just to kind of calm it down so you can keep walking.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Cause you're doing the right thing and I know that your intentions are great.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But you just got to keep going.  You've got to find a way so you can keep exercises cause what happens when you exercise the muscles use up the sugar and you don’t need the insulin, you use it up without insulin okay.  That's the way the body's made you know.  The muscles, you know when you exercise they know that they can't wait for the insulin.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: They predict you and they use the sugar on their own and they're going to be dropping your sugar level and it's a natural way of the body controlling the diabetes.
PATIENT: Yeah like when I walk, I always get painful while I'm going, coming back it's you know, it's not too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED] sugar is still [REDACTED] controlled [REDACTED] kidneys, not good.  And [REDACTED] I think we've got to be real aggressive with this.  [REDACTED].  I'm gonna talk to my boss, DOCTOR [REDACTED].  Possibly going to 75 [REDACTED] you’re at 65?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Possibly going to 75 and maybe increasing the Aspart to 8 units.  See how the 75 goes and if that's okay, then fine and if it's too high then going up to 9 units.
PATIENT: Okay, is there anything, in my prescriptions that could be making it?
DOCTOR: No.  This is what happens. This is what happens, so you know you get diabetes so then your pancreas which is the main organ involved with making insulin okay so when you first start getting diabetes, it's not making insulin well.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Most of the cells are not working as they should be, but some of them still are, some of them are still working.  As time goes on the cells that are working start dying, they give up because they get fatigued.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: It's like pumping.
PATIENT: Yeah they're doing all the work.
DOCTOR: Exactly, so what you find is a lot of times people are controlled because some of those cells stop working and you get to the point that these cells kind of give up.  You know at that point, the cells are not producing anything so and the that's the insulin requirements that you’re having is normal in the sense that [REDACTED] you know, what do you [REDACTED] right.  But you know it's not, giving up hope [REDACTED] not getting better [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You're eating fruits; you're eating good meals and watching it?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: At home you told me your blood pressures are less than 130s [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Between 125.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you know don't worry about the, you know I mentioned when you're at home just write them down for me, you know write them and kind of keep a log [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well I [REDACTED] got ‘em written down. I got a nurse coming a couple weeks [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But just write them down for me and bring it in so I can actually see it.
PATIENT: Let's go up to uh [REDACTED].  Even 10 on that Aspart.
DOCTOR: Uh I mean the Aspart I don't know if it's gonna do the trick.
PATIENT: I don't either but I can't, it's hard for me to [REDACTED] with one eye.  It's easier for me to see the 10.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Than it is for me to try to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: We'll see how it goes, we'll go up on the Lantus first.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And that'll help you out.  Other than that you been doing okay?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Have a seat.  How's your vision doing?
PATIENT: Uh been about the same, bad.
DOCTOR: Have you seen the eye doctor yet?
PATIENT: They were supposed to put in a consult for low vision but I never heard anything about it.
DOCTOR: And you're gonna see the eye doctor soon?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You can also pop by the clinic and let them know you’re supposed  low vision.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Don’t wait. Was it a long time ago?
PATIENT: Last month.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] yeah you should stop by the clinic and see what's going on.  Say ah for me.  Say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: But I know that some of this stuff would be definitely very helpful for you.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] you know even with my glasses I can't see my watch.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath, again, again.  Breathe normal now, [REDACTED].  Any leg swelling?
PATIENT: This one all the time [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: They both have a little swelling.  You're using the water pill right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And when you're home are you elevating your legs?  You don't elevate them?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Even when you're watching TV?
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Were you doing it?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Well when you're watching TV or just sitting down, you know on the couch, just keep them elevated.
PATIENT: A lot of times I'm laying down and elevate it and when I go in the bed.  [REDACTED] pillows.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED].  Your cholesterol looks great.
PATIENT: It should because I’ve been taking that Metamucil.  [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Yeah Metamucil is great.  Those keep the bowel going.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Something in that medicine I'm taking it keeps me constipated.
DOCTOR: Right.  I might give you a couple of refills let me do that now, you’re running low on a lot of meds.
PATIENT: I need a refill on the [REDACTED].  I mean I use [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I'm going to go talk with my attending and I'll be right back.
(DOCTOR OUT:  74:38  DOCTOR IN:  85:08)
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED] You’re having no problems giving yourself the insulin at all, I know your vision is not the best but you can still see the needle and the line.
PATIENT: Right, right.  [REDACTED] I have to look real close.  I have a magnifier, even with a magnifier it's hard you know.  To see you know the lines.
DOCTOR: Are you confident you’re giving yourself the right dosage?
PATIENT: Oh yeah I believe so.
DOCTOR: 100%?  90%?  75%?
PATIENT: Well on the Glargine, on the Aspart, I might miss, you know, one line or two.
DOCTOR: So on the Aspart the to 100, want to make sure you’re giving yourself 65.
PATIENT: On the Glargine.
DOCTOR: I want to make sure about that.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] Isn’t it marked?  I might go halfway that's the way I've been judging it now.
DOCTOR: That’s the issue. I think maybe it might not have to do with how much we’re giving you, but maybe because of your vision then you have a hard time doing it.  Let me check something.
DOCTOR: Do you live by yourself or is there anybody at home that could help you with it?
PATIENT: I'm all by myself.
(Silence from 87:38 - 90:59)
DOCTOR: So this is the stuff we're trying to figure out.  We're trying, we're gonna try to get something different that's gonna help with that.  Instead of using the needle, we're going to try to give you these insulin pen okay.  Instead of drawing blood, like drawing into a syringe you're going, it's a pump, not a pump but a little contraption okay and then it'll show the number on it.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Instead of drawing and looking at the lines, you're going to set it for numbers and we think it is something that will help and it has a little insulin bottle.  Do you think that's be a lot easier than the insulin?
PATIENT: Yeah.  So I was going to tell you was if I made a mistake, it would be giving one or two units too much and not too less.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you’re over-compensating?
PATIENT: I could be I mean, if that's my problem [REDACTED].  Cause I have a problem counting those lines, I'm not going to go under, I'm not going to go over you know.
DOCTOR: So let's see.  I think if that could work and we could get these pens, it’s going to be a lot easier anyway and we should be 100% sure exactly how much you have okay.  Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Whatever you want to do.  What about this Losartan?
DOCTOR: Oh yeah it's a blood blood pressure medication.
PATIENT: Oh I thought it was for the kidneys.
DOCTOR: Yeah it is for the kidneys cause the problem is your blood pressure and your sugar, aren’t well controlled - those are the two most important things.  We got to get your blood pressure and sugars corrected okay and no overloading your sugars.  So your blood pressure [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: Yeah the blood pressure's fine cause it has dropped down to 113, 118 you know.  Like I said, most of the time at home, it could be the meter, because it’s always 120s, anywhere from 120-133 I'll say it like that.  It's never in the 140s at home.  That's why I'm so surprised because today it was 147.
DOCTOR: Well let me go check with him once more.
(DOCTOR OUT:  93:29)  DOCTOR IN:  94:10)
DOCTOR: We'll have you on your way we just want to check out one more spot.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Hi.
DOCTOR: So um the only um, [REDACTED] short acting [REDACTED] the only change is that um [REDACTED] Glargine and [REDACTED].  The [REDACTED] pen is actually cheaper [REDACTED] VA physician prefers.  Glargine can be switched [REDACTED] unit to unit.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that would be the preferred option.  [REDACTED].  There are two [REDACTED] but can you feel it click, to get your dose as opposed to having to measure you know.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So it's easier for people who can't see 100% anymore.  [REDACTED] non formulary and I guess [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yes definitely.  Okay, good.
DOCTOR: Alright we'll do that.
PATIENT: Sounds good.
DOCTOR: We'll try to do this.
PATIENT: But I can still take them at the same time?
DOCTOR: Exactly, the same.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] don't mix them.
DOCTOR: So it looks right now, a couple of things.  I'm willing to go up to 70 as long as you're more or less sure that you're giving yourself.  How confident are you that you're giving yourself 65?
PATIENT: Um well I 100%
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] so we'll do 70.  And 70 units at night right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: They are going to mail these, okay. Actually you could probably pick it up at the window, let’s see what happens.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.  Now I need the, I order the isosorbide.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I need it now cause.
DOCTOR: Are you talking about [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I take it three times a day.
DOCTOR: Okay so we're giving you a pen for that.
PATIENT: No, no, that's the insulin.
DOCTOR: Yeah we're going to adjust the insulin.
PATIENT: Uh is this the, this is the one for the heart.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, I'm going to refill all of your medications.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  The last time they gave me 160,000 refills.
DOCTOR: Did you have to pay for it?
PATIENT: Yeah and I did then, but I don't know why they not charging me now.  Somebody made a mistake somehow.  I know that [REDACTED] pay so much [REDACTED] in a year.  So right now I'm worried about my kidneys failing because of that dialysis.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] it always help just having it syringes and all [REDACTED] pens [REDACTED] refills so you know you just put the little [REDACTED] they'll show you how to do it.  Put the cartridges in, select the number and [REDACTED] still using the .
PATIENT: Uh no.  I been taking [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: The hydralazine still taking.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You need Lantus.
PATIENT: I don't need the Lantus.
DOCTOR: You're out of refills. Do you want more refills for the future?
PATIENT: Yes, more refills. I do that three times a day too.
DOCTOR: The Losartan, okay, the metoprolol.  Quetiapine and furosemide.
PATIENT: Furosemide
DOCTOR: Omeprazole?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you still get heartburn?
PATIENT: No.  Every now and, you know if I don't.  I can go three, four or five days without taking one of those but I get it you know.
DOCTOR: Maybe once a week you get it?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Does it only happen when you eat the wrong foods?
PATIENT: No, it just comes automatically if I don't, you know like I say after three or four days you know.
DOCTOR: Simvastatin.  Are you using the Vicodin [ill?
PATIENT: No, I haven't.
DOCTOR: Isosorbide.
PATIENT: Yeah.  [REDACTED].  I don’t know if I need that one or not.
DOCTOR: And what about the vitamin D?
PATIENT: If they still want me to take it.  [REDACTED] take it just once a week.
DOCTOR: And they're having you take it once a week?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay so I so how about I see you in six to eight weeks to see how your sugar is doing? But in the meantime, the pharmacist is going to see you again. Two weeks?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: There you go and in the meantime, I want to today to go by the Lab and your kidneys.
PATIENT: All right.
DOCTOR: Did you get your flu shot this season?
PATIENT: Uh huh, last time I was here.
DOCTOR: (Someone knocked on the door)  Doctor speaks to someone at the door.  Um are you going to go see the eye doctor [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Uh no I [REDACTED] don’t have an appointment.
DOCTOR: I'm going to set you up for another appointment so they can help you out [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.  [REDACTED] call me or something.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And when you're coming in [REDACTED].
