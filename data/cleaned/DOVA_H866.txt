DOCTOR: Let's see if they put in, yeah.  They put in that they're gonna contact you about it um.
PATIENT: So they're gonna call me?
DOCTOR: Yeah they're gonna call you.  I mean, you had a colonoscopy already in 2007.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you are due um.  It's a little early.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: But uh it’s okay, we'll just put that you've been having all this pain and what not.
PATIENT: It's not way too early is it?
DOCTOR: No.  It's like a few months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So it won't really make a difference.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Because you know when I had it done the first time, she said they found two something and they cut them off.
DOCTOR: Yep and that's why you have to have it done five years later so that one was about five years ago.  Um and then I saw so you went and got you hearing aids.
PATIENT: Yeah I got one hearing aid.
DOCTOR: How's that so uh they did find anything wrong.  Cause I remember the last time your hearing.
PATIENT: That's because some of my hearing is lost in the left ear.
DOCTOR: That is, well I'm glad that you have that for your left one.
PATIENT: I forgot it.
DOCTOR: Oh.  Well you can hear me, sound good.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Why don't you sit up here I'll take a listen to you.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Deep breath.
PATIENT: I got what they did with my naval.  I had um.
DOCTOR: I'm going to have you lay back.
PATIENT: What's that operation?
DOCTOR: Hernia.
PATIENT: Umbilical.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And sometime there be something running out of it.
DOCTOR: But does it go back in?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  I got one more thing.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: I got a cough.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: At night I have a real bad cough.  It just started a couple days ago.
DOCTOR: Have you been using your inhalers?  Okay, does it help?  Probably your asthma with changing of the season.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what I was thinking.
DOCTOR: Usually nighttime cough, that's what it is.
PATIENT: Yeah it's bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um you're just taking the albuterol now right?
PATIENT: Um I don't know they gave me something.  I was taking.
DOCTOR: Formoterol are you using that too?
PATIENT: No they gave me just one.
DOCTOR: Formoterol with mometasone?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: No steroids?
PATIENT: I was taking it but she gave me this one that replaced that.  Instead of taking both of them she said it's just one.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's one.  Uh I don't know the name of it.  It's the two things in one.  But it's a steroid, you been using that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How long has the cough been going on?
PATIENT: About three days.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And I think maybe we should just let it ride out for a little bit. With the season, I don’t think changing the medicines is gonna do much.  I'm pretty sure it's probably the asthma so I think you just have to give it a little bit of time.  If it gets worse we can maybe try changing the medicines.  I think with only three days we don't really want to do anything aggressive and then have you on too much medicine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Does that sound okay?  Your lungs sound good.  You're not wheezing or anything like that so.  Um and you haven't had a prostate exam yet or anything like that have you?  Uh uh.
PATIENT: I thought the colonoscopy and the prostate is different?
DOCTOR: Yeah the colon, the prostate is a different uh.
PATIENT: I never have done it.
DOCTOR: We can do a blood test to look for that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and then.
PATIENT: I don't know I took a blood test.  Oh you already took it.
DOCTOR: Do what?  You had a blood test.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah it looked at um, it looked at your, we want to look at your lipids, your cholesterol.  You haven't had that for a while so um.  Alright well let me go talk with DOCTOR to see if he has any other thoughts about things to change and you're not taking anything for your cholesterol are you?
PATIENT: Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We might need to go up on one of these blood pressure pills cause it looks like the last time you were here it was a little high.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So maybe we'll go up on your amlodipine um, so we'll go ask him okay.  I'll be right back.  Everything else looks great.
(DOCTOR OUT:  35:11  DOCTOR IN:  37:18)
DOCTOR: Alright.  Everything he said looks good.  We'll just do blood tests today.  We'll go up on the amlodipine and um.
PATIENT: Um could you put in um a what do you call it?  A consult for me to go to the gym or the Wellness Center?
DOCTOR: Yeah, I can, sure um.
PATIENT: Cause I haven't been in a couple of weeks so I might be out of the.
DOCTOR: Um let me, let me make sure [REDACTED] here.  You've been there before yes?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay yeah I can put everything in.  So we'll just um on your way out, I guess just stop.  I don't know um just ask her at the front about getting the shot.  I don't know how to order it um if they know how they can let me know.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So we can get one.
PATIENT: What is that, the tetanus?
DOCTOR: Yeah the tetanus shot um, they should be able to order it up there, I think, or the nurse can.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then um get the blood tests and then I'll have them send you the new prescription in the mail if you want.
