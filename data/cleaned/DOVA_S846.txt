DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: How's it going?  I'm DOCTOR.  You got your reports?
PATIENT: Yeah shall we take a look at the EKG?
DOCTOR: When did you get an EKG?
PATIENT: Uh three weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Why'd you get an EKG?  Did I order that or?
PATIENT: Uh no another doctor ordered it uh.  I had uh; well I had a period of shortness of breath.  I'm on the Agent Orange Registry and I said I'd better get an EKG to check for ischemia cause I know that came up on me.
DOCTOR: You're on the what registry?
PATIENT: The Agent Orange Registry.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: And that's a result, I was exposed to it.  I said we better check that and that EKG showed ischemia and it was very irregular and we kind of.
DOCTOR: Do you have chest pain?
PATIENT: Uh no but I know I get dizzy once in a while.  That could be from the blood pressure going up sometimes.  I got, see when I first started coming here my pressure was way up, now you got it under control but uh I been.
DOCTOR: So you got the chest x-rays because you're short of breath?
PATIENT: Uh the EKG?
DOCTOR: Yeah EKG.
PATIENT: Yeah I was concerned because it came up on me [REDACTED] before the Agent Orange.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it came up on the registry and pluls I have high blood pressure so you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: From Vietnam so I was a little concerned about that so we said we better get an EKG.
DOCTOR: And what symptoms were you having?  You were feeling short of breath when you walked or just when you were resting?
PATIENT: Uh when I walk.
DOCTOR: When you walk and how long had that been going on?
PATIENT: Uh it's just off and on.
DOCTOR: How many blocks can you walk before you get short of breath or how many flights of stairs can you walk before you get short of breath?
PATIENT: Uh I can maybe go at least a flight.
DOCTOR: Is that new or old?  Has that always been the case for a while or is that like that's been here less than a week?
PATIENT: No it's been like this for quite a while.
DOCTOR: Quite a while of years?
PATIENT: Years. Since Vietnam.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So your shortness of breath when you exert yourself is not new wouldn't you say?
PATIENT: No, no it's not [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So uh what did it get worst that made you say or did you just see the registry and like hey I better get my.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, that's basically what I did, yeah that's why I started taking a look.
DOCTOR: So I'm taking a look at it now.  Let me just print it out, let's see here.
PATIENT: And I talked to the nurse.  She said it's probably the dizziness.  I need to quit smoking.  I've tried to quit smoking 20 times and the problem when I smoke it runs my pressure up and that probably what makes me dizzy once in a while so.  It's not all the time.
DOCTOR: Yeah I.
PATIENT: So I got to quit smoking I know that.
DOCTOR: The best thing you can do for yourself is to quit smoking.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How are you doing at that?
PATIENT: I cut it down.
DOCTOR: Well you were up to a pack a day the last time I saw you.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm at a half now.
DOCTOR: At half pack a day.
PATIENT: Yeah and if I could get it.
DOCTOR: You go to the Smoking Cessation Clinic?  They can help.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm trying to do it on my own.
DOCTOR: Trying to do it on your own?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If it don't work then I'll go to the clinic.
DOCTOR: Cause on Monday you don't need an appointment you just walked in.
PATIENT: You mean right here?
DOCTOR: Yeah no appointment.
PATIENT: Well I.
DOCTOR: Do you want me to give you the information to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah I'll come up.
DOCTOR: You walk in, you don't need an appointment there’s one on Monday they'll give you gums, patches.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And the other one on Wednesdays is more like a group thing, kind of like working through a group thing but you can't get any of the gums or patches on that one.
PATIENT: But I can just walk in on Monday?
DOCTOR: You can just walk in.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let me give you the information.
PATIENT: I've cut it down but I need to quit.
DOCTOR: Yeah that would definitely be the best thing you can do for your health.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is to prevent cancer, you get lung cancer you know with smoking.  You increase your chances like 10 times and you can increase your chance of getting a heart attack or a stroke by multiple times by smoking so a lot of risk factors with the smoking definitely uh, you know.
PATIENT: Now I have the ischemia what was my concern, my family that cuts
down on you, that means you're not getting oxygen to some part of your heart.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Ischemia just means like a heart attack.  In medical terms they call it a myocardial ischemia.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That just means you know the heart's not getting oxygen like you said.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: When your tissues don't get oxygen they start dying.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So when your heart muscle starts dying, okay that's what we call a heart attack and obviously.
PATIENT: You’re at risk.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So you get a lot of other problems besides that and the heart can sometimes recover but it can never recover fully and that's when people get what we call congestive heart failure with the heart not pumping as much as it can and they get you know a lot more deconditioned and they can't you know you may know people who can walk from this end of the room to that end of the room without ever getting short of breath.
PATIENT: Yeah. I’m not like that.
DOCTOR: You know they're probably not able so that's what I'm saying like that's what happens.
PATIENT: Can I, can I improve on that maybe by a treadmill or something like that?  Would that help it?
DOCTOR: Diet, exercise, weight loss, cutting out smoking, controlling your blood pressure all those things will prevent.  These have all been studied, widely studied right and they look at people and they say what we should do, what can we do to prevent heart attacks and the thing they found is you know controlling your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Have your pressure in good control.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Quit smoking.  I got to quit smoking.
DOCTOR: You know controlling your cholesterol, cause cholesterol can cause heart attacks.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Quitting smoking okay.  Age, you can't change that.  Genetics, you can't change that.
PATIENT: But how can Agent Orange cause that?
DOCTOR: Agent Orange?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: They told me that's related?
DOCTOR: Uh I don't know, I actually have to look into Agent Orange, I'm not an expert on Agent Orange.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'm know I'm on the registry.
DOCTOR: But Agent Orange, so I know there are some lung uh and there's some uh.
PATIENT: They said high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: There's some cancers that can be related to Agent Orange.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh lymphomas.
PATIENT: Yeah right.  See I'm on the registry and there was a letter saying that ischemia came up on the list as one of them.
DOCTOR: Yeah, on the list as one of them okay.
PATIENT: And I just figured, how could they know that caused it?
DOCTOR: So the Urology Clinic people they're following your PSAs?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh you saw them in March.
PATIENT: Yes he's following that.
DOCTOR: And we'll work on that.  How's the, your blood pressure medicines you're still taking all of them?
PATIENT: I been taking all of them.  Uh they told me if I could start working out maybe we can eliminate one but right now I'm taking all of them.  But it's keeping my pressure down.
DOCTOR: You're taking metoprolol and you're taking the hydrochlorothiazide and Losartan all those pills?
PATIENT: Right, yes.
DOCTOR: And you're taking the amlodipine?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Alright um yes and then you remember a low salt diet cause a low salt diet will help prevent you know, you from getting high blood pressure as well.  Um.
PATIENT: Eating a lot of seafood now.
DOCTOR: How's your mood been doing?  Do you still follow with the psychiatrist and everything?
PATIENT: Yeah my PTSD is getting worse.  I haven't worked in eight months.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh I'm under a lot of stress and like I said when I heard about this ischemia with my heart it made me worse cause you know I hadn't been sleeping but the doctor did give me some, I got some, I came in and got some pills for the stress.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I get too, a little bit too upset but uh that's why I'm trying to work on everything.  I mean I'm on the internet and you know my family's working with me.
DOCTOR: No chest pain, no pressure, no palpitations um?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And no shortness of breath at rest and you have a little bit of dyspnea on the, a little bit of shortness of breath when you move.
PATIENT: When I exert myself.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: I think maybe that's from not being, not working out.
DOCTOR: Any of those night sweats any more or fevers or chills at night?
PATIENT: I still get night sweats.
DOCTOR: You still get night sweats?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And it is, uh how long have you had your night sweats for?
PATIENT: Since Vietnam.  I wake up.
DOCTOR: Vietnam.
PATIENT: I sleep maybe two hours then I can't sleep.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I know we had tried a new sleep aid on yo,u right.  Didn't Psychiatry give you a new prescription?
PATIENT: I tried that.
DOCTOR: Is that helping or not helping anymore?
PATIENT: It did help because uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Before I was trying to drink beer to go to sleep.  I don't like alcohol.
DOCTOR: You're not drinking anymore, right?
PATIENT: Oh no, no.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: The pills eliminated that so.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: It helps.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So you're still getting the night sweats a little bit.
PATIENT: Oh yes.
DOCTOR: But you think it may be related to PTSD?
PATIENT: I know it is.
DOCTOR: Okay we sent a bunch of tests off.  Those were all negative.  Just to let you know the hepatitis B, C, thyroid and it was normal.  Your blood tests look good.
PATIENT: Great.
DOCTOR: And that's all you know good news.
PATIENT: And those sweats all from PTSD yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's something I'm have to live with.
DOCTOR: You get any chest pain when you exert yourself or just the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Just a little shortness of breath that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And besides having this do you ever pass out?
PATIENT: No, no, no.  I just get a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: You know is it dizzy when you stand up, like is it positional or is it even if you're laying in bed you can get this dizziness.
PATIENT: Uh usually standing up.
DOCTOR: When you're standing up.
PATIENT: Uh yeah you know what it is like see, when I was in the Marine Corps.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: If you smoke.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And during basic training I only smoked two cigarettes a day.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Because by not smoking regular and stuff like that, you know when you smoke a cigarette you get dizzy.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's what kind of dizziness I get.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I say well maybe that's from smoking cigarettes.
DOCTOR: Maybe it’s from smoking cigarettes.
PATIENT: Yeah that's the same dizziness I got when I was in boot camp.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I was only smoking two cigarettes a day.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED] deep breath in and out.  Again.  Good, again.  Good again.  Good again.  [REDACTED].  Okay.  Do you need refills on medications today?
PATIENT: Uh no I think I'm okay right now.  So then the EKG, that's something I should be really concerned about?
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm gonna take a look at it.
PATIENT: Oh, oh you [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's in the computer but it's easier to look at uh, easier to look at it on paper.
PATIENT: Yeah.  My wife thinks she’s a doc, she’s scared to death when she saw it.  I had a copy of it but I told her, let me talk to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm gonna take a look at it right now.
(DOCTOR OUT:  43:03  DOCTOR IN:  49:19)
DOCTOR: Let me get that for you.
PATIENT: Let me ask you something, does the high blood pressure make you sleepy all the time, a lot?
DOCTOR: No it shouldn't.
PATIENT: Cause I'm sitting up watching TV and a lot of times I get sleepy and my wife thought maybe it was the high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Uh no.  Blood pressures, high blood pressures don't make you sleepy.
PATIENT: That's fine, it's probably.
DOCTOR: Sometimes medicines can do that.
PATIENT: It's from not sleeping at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well that's been since Vietnam.
DOCTOR: Have a seat up here.
(DOCTOR OUT:  49:51  DOCTOR IN: 60:32)
DOCTOR: Alright.  [REDACTED] no appointment needed.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You can just walk in any time between this time.
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: How'd that EKG look to you?
DOCTOR: Well the EKG you got, yeah so these waves right here that are upside, these are supposed to be pointing up.
PATIENT: The inverted P waves.
DOCTOR: The waves that are going up.
PATIENT: An inverted T wave right.
DOCTOR: Inverted T waves.
PATIENT: T wave, yeah Q, R, S and T yeah.
DOCTOR: If they're reading up or someone's been telling you?
PATIENT: My wife’s a respiratory therapist.
DOCTOR: Okay yeah.
PATIENT: And she say yeah it looks like ischemia but I said let me talk to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So you have inverted T waves.  These are nonspecific, it means that it's, you know if we could say wow this means that you have, that you're having a heart attack.  Right or something like that. This could mean that people would have had like prior, maybe some damage to the heart.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: They will have it and other times people will be normal and they'll have this.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so it's not specific.  It's not necessarily but you do have some of those inverted T's here and then the fact that your, these waves are really high, they're indicate like hypertrophy, that the muscle of the.
PATIENT: It's called high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: Yeah QRS complex.
DOCTOR: Right exactly.
PATIENT: So maybe it was ischemic.
DOCTOR: Well it's not ischemic, this doesn't necessarily mean ischemia it just means that you have high blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  This, these flipped T's mean that uh, you know it could mean ischemia, prior ischemia.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: The fact that these waves aren't really elevated means that you're not having like a heart attack like right now or something.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: But this may or may not so I think the best thing to do would be, since you got the shortness of breath when you walked is just to do a stress test.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: A treadmill stress test.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: They put some things on your chest.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Stick these on the chest, you run on a treadmill or walk on a treadmill; under stress situation and they see if your heart has any ischemia.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So we'll set that up.
PATIENT: Okay thank you.
DOCTOR: Right that's one.  The second have you ever been on cholesterol medicine?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So, are you fasting today or did you eat?
PATIENT: I haven't eaten anything that's why my stomach's growling.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well I'm gonna lay out two options for you okay.  Let me show you something.  This is your cholesterol profile.  Okay this was in January of this year, this is what we got recently last time I saw you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: This is what it was in 2008.  LDL, LDL cholesterol is the bad cholesterol.  We want as less of that as possible okay in our body.  You are 117, that's pretty good.  I mean a normal healthy person, a young healthy person we want 160 or less.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and uh with someone with high blood pressure, as we get older we may be like the number 130 or less so you're still at that goal.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But in January you were 176, it's fairly high.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: For a guy that, your risk factor for heart attack are high blood pressure, your age and you're smoking.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so those three risk factors if you put it into a calculator and with your cholesterol profile puts you at risk of having a heart attack at about 25% in the next ten years.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we want to lower that risk as much as possible okay.  So your goal by that calculator would be this goal should be less than 100.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But you're above on that okay.  Your HDL that's the good cholesterol okay.  We want that at least 45 or above in males.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you're good there.  You have enough of the good cholesterol.  Triglycerides are okay.  Your total cholesterol number is high as well.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay which is probably reflective of that as well.  So this number is pretty high.
PATIENT: So I got to get that LDL down uh.
DOCTOR: You get the LDL down so, this one is, we could either since this number was so good and this was in 2008, I'm going to lay out the option we could either A recheck it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then based on what that shows we'd start you on a cholesterol medicine or we just go ahead and bite the bullet and start the cholesterol medicine today.
PATIENT: I would rather maybe recheck it because we cut down on a lot of the fatty; we eat a lot of fish now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So uh I'd rather recheck it.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: With diet and exercise, if you optimize the diet, you can lower this by about, they say about 15%.
PATIENT: Without medications.
DOCTOR: Without medications.
PATIENT: Okay.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay so you know.  If you lower this that 15%, you know you take 15% off of this, that still wouldn't take you at the goal of 100 or less.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I just want you to understand that.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Now if you do optimizing nutrition in your diet, I don't want you and this gets lower I don't want you and we still start you on cholesterol medicine I don't want that to discourage you or do all this work and it meant nothing.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Right that's not true because you won't need that high of a dose of the medicine A or as you continue to exercise or if you cut out your smoking, you know your other risk factors may go away.  Smoking is a big one that you could change.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Your age you probably can't change right.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You can't do anything about your age and you have to change the fact that you have high blood pressure.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: We can control it, we can't change the fact that you have it okay, we can’t change the fact that you had it, but you can change the fact that you smoke and that will change your risk okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I'd rather see if I can get that LDL down and have it rechecked.
DOCTOR: So you haven’t, you haven't ate today so would you like to have it rechecked today?
PATIENT: Uh I'd rather do it on the next visit cause I'd like to try to do something to get it down.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh if possible because you know that's a big jump from 117 to 176.
DOCTOR: Yeah it is a big.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Yeah this was in September of 08 you know.
PATIENT: Yeah it could've been the diet, you know if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I don't know if you were fasting that day either.  That shouldn't throw things off too much because if you were eating and it was real high because you're eating your triglycerides would have been high so I don't think, I think these are fairly accurate measurements.
PATIENT: Oh wait a minute, you know why it's up, my weight's gone up 20 pounds.  See I normally keep it at a constant weight.  I'm 20 pounds higher, I'm normally 165.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you're 180, you're 185.
PATIENT: Yeah right, right so.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: It's this extra weight.
DOCTOR: Would you like, let me tell you this.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So do you want us to hold off on starting the medicine or would you like to start a low dose of the cholesterol medicine, do your diet and exercise.
PATIENT: What are the side effects?
DOCTOR: Side effects of the cholesterol medicines it's generally a safe medicine.  You can get some muscle pain with it.
PATIENT: Oh, that no problem.
DOCTOR: You can get some muscle pain with it.  If you get muscle pain with it you stop it and you come back and tell us.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But that's the major side effect.
PATIENT: Oh okay, yeah a low dose maybe.
DOCTOR: You want to try a low dose?
PATIENT: Yes I would like to try it.
DOCTOR: We'll start a low dose.
PATIENT: Okay yeah I was worried about side effects.
DOCTOR: I want you to still do the diet and exercise and I want you to lose those extra pounds.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I mean.
DOCTOR: That way when we check it in six months your cholesterol may be at the goal we want it and we could maybe.
PATIENT: Take me off it?
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah I am 20 pounds over my weight so.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you're not going to be able to lose that weight overnight.  You know it's going to take some time so maybe the cholesterol medicine might be a good thing to start you with okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Yeah cause I mean if it was low, I was 20 pounds lighter so then I gained this weight and the cholesterol goes up.  That's got to be it.
DOCTOR: You want to pick it up today or do you want it sent to you?
PATIENT: Uh they can send it to me.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So take this medicine at night okay?
PATIENT: Okay.  Just one time a night.
DOCTOR: One time a night.  The reason why we have it at night cause actually your cholesterol level goes high at night.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay while you're sleeping.  It's the natural cycle of the body so when you take it in the evening dose.  Okay it's going to give you instructions like it's a 20 mg tablet and the instructions are to break it in half so I only started you on a low dose, 10 mg okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: So I just take one half each night.
DOCTOR: Each night.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I renewed your other blood pressure medicines which isn't a problem alright.  You're going to try to quit smoking and I'll give you the information on that.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And uh let me order the stress test.  Now they're gonna send you out a letter telling you when to come in for the stress test okay.
PATIENT: Okay no problem.
DOCTOR: Um and you may need to stop your uh, just hold your metoprolol.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: They'll give you instructions.
PATIENT: The day…
DOCTOR: Okay.  That lowers your heart rate a little bit so they don't want you to take that until the day before your exam.
PATIENT: Now that stress test is to see if I got a problem with my heart?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Oh good okay.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You're on 50 mg of metoprolol right?
PATIENT: Uh yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay so yeah so they'll give you instructions on like what to do right before they send you out a thing and instructions like don't eat after midnight so we'll set that up as well and I'll have you back in let's say two or three months and see how you're doing with the weight loss, the smoking and everything else okay.
PATIENT: Yeah if I can get that weight down that cholesterol should go down.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: I agree, I think so. and keep taking your blood pressure medicine.
PATIENT: Oh exactly.
DOCTOR: Yeah don't be stressed out. That’s not good for you, so everything is going to be alright so he's checking out to.
PATIENT: Thank you very much, I feel much better.
DOCTOR: If you have any problems let me know.  Like I said those EKG came back nonspecific so it doesn't mean that you had a.
PATIENT: Oh those tests didn't show that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Alright thank you.
