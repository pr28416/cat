PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then the rest of it you can have it mailed but if that's the way you want to do it.
PATIENT: I got no cholesterol, the cholesterol.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's right.  It's really up.
PATIENT: The doctor gave me that one pill and told me to cut it in half, that's stupid because the pill cutter can’t [REDACTED] little pill and cut a little pill. If I'm gonna cut it in half.  That thing won't cut right.  And the Lasix [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Which one?

PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We can go up on that okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: How long were in you Jackson Park?
PATIENT: A week.
DOCTOR: A week.
PATIENT: We [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Feeling better since then?
PATIENT: No really.  Slowly [REDACTED] tired.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I got to lose some weight.  I have to lose weight [REDACTED] before I.
DOCTOR: We have a program here.
PATIENT: I got to be 295 [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And I think that's probably why you're getting back pain.  [REDACTED] the joints in your back and your knees and muscles you put a lot of strain on them with the weight.  There's a program to help you.  It's called the MOVE Program, you heard of it?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: It's basically to help you with nutrition, helps you with exercise.  We have a gym here and we have some like recreation stuff you can use.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] can’t get here.
DOCTOR: How'd get rid of that?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] get paid for something.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um it should right, if they arrange for that or not but I think it'd be a good thing for you.  You know this weight is only going to make the heart failure worse too so.  It's gonna be difficult to keep that blood pressure under control and when the blood pressure gets out of control then the heart has more strain.  I think dealing with the weight is gonna be just as important as dealing with all these other little personal things you deal with.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you have an appointment with the pharmacist today um.
PATIENT: Well I'll be meeting [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And it says here you have it from 1-2 o'clock.  In the meantime I'll have you go to the Pharmacy and pick up your Lasix and your simvastatin okay and we'll have you pick up some more of the Losartan for your high blood pressure.  Do you have a heating pack at home for that back?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: No.  Heat works really well for those types of muscle things.  Um I don't want to give you any ibuprofen.
PATIENT: I generally take Aleve.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Uh you've got some Tylenol [REDACTED] that you can try. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: [REDACTED]@  I got upset when I couldn't button these pants.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Why do you think you gained weight?
PATIENT: [REDACTED]  So any it's getting hard to fluctuate [REDACTED] move.  I [REDACTED] lay in the bed.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh. Swelling is okay. Is this usually how it is?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] too much fluid.  Have you had to sleep on pillows at night, to be able to breathe?
PATIENT: I sleep [REDACTED] every night.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] okay, four pillows [REDACTED].  Are you coughing anything up still?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: No okay.  Any fevers or chills recently?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay um.  Let me talks to DOCTOR about getting you transportation to the MOVE Program.  We'll get your prescriptions and uh and then you know I would try a heat pack at night.  At Walgreens they have ones that you can plug in.  They have ones that you put in the microwave.  They've got a whole bunch of different kinds that you can try on that area.  Where is it exactly?
PATIENT: Right here.
DOCTOR: What I would do is if you can, when you're lying in bed either every morning or if you're sitting in the chair later in the evening, put a heat pack on that area.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and the heat will help kind of penetrate the muscle.
