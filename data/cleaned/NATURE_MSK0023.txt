DOCTOR: OK, no, yeah, that's really that's really good that you're thinking like that. Any issues at school like bullying or do you feel unsafe either at home, around your home environment or at school?
PATIENT: No, I don't feel unsafe. I mean, I know there's always those kids at school who are mean to others. But I mean, I, I generally feel safe.
DOCTOR: OK, alright so I'm just going to ask a few questions about just the examination part of part of this. Do you, so you mentioned you can't flex your knees at all, can you extend them?
PATIENT: Yeah it it can, uh, straighten it out all like most of the way, it seems like it's bent a little still maybe from like the swelling and only I can't straighten it out the full way.
DOCTOR: OK, and then you said you noticed like bruising and kind of like there's blood accumulating in that area?
PATIENT: Yeah exactly yeah, it looks like it. 'cause it's a bit like Brown. I guess I can like see or on my knee I guess like the like a big bruise.
DOCTOR: OK, I see. OK. And. Yeah, so those are kind of like all the questions I had for you. It seems that based on the description of how the injury happened an the mechanism and what you're feeling right now and in terms of the examination, it's possible that you had knee ligament injury. Most likely in this case, the anterior cruciate ligament, but just to make sure we will need to do an MRI of your knee and see which ligament is affected and to what extent. Uh, and usually with the with the depending on what we find on the MRI sometimes it can be just conservative management, but however oftentimes you do require surgery, so it would be. Just a surgery where we put kind of like a scope in into your knee and through the scope we try to fix the ligament. So yeah first, we'll just do the MRI and see to what extent your knee injury is and how how affected the ligaments are, and then we'll go from there. Does that sound OK?
PATIENT: It does. Yeah yeah, thank you.
DOCTOR: Welcome alright, Take care.
