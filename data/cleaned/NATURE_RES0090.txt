DOCTOR: No, OK, alright, so those are all the questions we had. Do you have any questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, what do you think I have and is there anything I need to do right now?
DOCTOR: Yeah, So what, uh, some of your symptoms are concerning, especially the coughing up blood, which is something that we always think of with tuberculosis. You don't have any history of, uh, family history of lung cancer or anything like that, so right now, especially since you just moved from India where tuberclosis is endemic, we need to make sure that we test you for tuberculosis. In the meantime though, you will need to stay in the hospital and be in an isolated room, uh, where we can filter some of the air and make sure, it's a very infective condition if you do have it so while you're getting all the tests done, you will need to stay here in an isolated room. Also, we will get some sputum smears and cultures to test for TB and we will also, I will need to, if the test comes back positive we will need to contact public health and let your contacts know as well. Lastly, we will also be getting, since you're having the hemoptysis, like coughing up blood, we will, we might also do a chest X-ray to see if
you, if you have active TB.
PATIENT: OK
DOCTOR: So those are, those are some of the things that we'll get started with. Is that OK with you? Any questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Uhm, no nothing like that, uhm do I need to isolate?
DOCTOR: Yeah, so we will keep you in an isolated room right now, when you're getting all those tests. And if you do have TB, you will need to isolate, uhm, and stay away from contacts, not be at work, we will, if you do in fact have TB, which it seems likely right now, you will be started in hospital on a ,like antibiotic therapy, uh, which consists of like four different medications and people with the active TB will do have to isolate during that time period, so yeah, we'll get some of those tests done and, we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
PATIENT: OK, great, thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome.
