PATIENT: I went in and I asked the lady and uh she says well you still got to take a number and I say no but I'm late.  I say there's only two of us here and I said but.
DOCTOR: No.

DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR.  Nice to meet you.
PATIENT: Nice to meet you.  What's your name again?
DOCTOR: DOCTOR.
PATIENT: DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah okay yeah.  Once I'm up there I would like to know what did the doc from upstairs, which I really did not like the doctor from the Pain Clinic.
DOCTOR: Oh you didn't?  What's the name?
PATIENT: That's what I'd like to know because every time I go up there there's like 10,000 different doctors I keep seeing.
DOCTOR: You need to see okay.  So the one you saw in December?
PATIENT: The one that I seen in December yes.  I tried to explain to him.
DOCTOR: Okay the Pain Fellow NAME?
PATIENT: Yes.  I tried to explain to him that the procedure that they did the month before.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Instead of doing good like all the other ones, it actually was worse.  I said the procedure must, you know if they don't work they must have been done wrong.  He said no none of the procedures have been done wrong.  If it doesn’t work it's not done wrong.  My, logically, it was done wrong.  Um well first of all I never feel the injections coming in and this one hurted like.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean yeah it was right where my pain was and what it did was make the pain even more worse.
DOCTOR: Really?
PATIENT: Yeah because by the time I got home.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: And moving around.  I'm not the type of person that I'm gonna sit down, it's just gonna make the pains more worse anyway.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: Okay give me one minute and I'm just gonna look at your chart here.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Since I haven't have a chance to look before. Medications, [REDACTED].  Blood pressure [REDACTED] Let’s see what they wanted to do the last time is, it looks like they saw you in the actual General Medicine Clinic last July, [REDACTED] lumbar spine.  Okay. Question, did you ever see Neurosurgery about this back problem?
PATIENT: Uh yes I did.
DOCTOR: And what did they say?
PATIENT: Well I don't want to put them, you know they want to, but the only operation that I told them that I would let them do.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, just letting you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh and that’s [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's not a neuro type of operation.
DOCTOR: That's fine, yeah because I know they’re not [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Because I will not do it.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] pain.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so then.
PATIENT: But the only one that I would like to get operated is the two chipped because I don't know if that may be one of those chipped bones, the ones that are on the right side.
DOCTOR: What chipped?
PATIENT: I have two chipped bones on each side that are real pointy because I don't understand why the pain goes from the, from here from my back and it just constantly here, both constantly completely around my leg.
DOCTOR: Around your leg?
PATIENT: It doesn't, no, no, it doesn't go down my leg.  Not as much as it just stays around my pelvis and my hip together.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  When you getting the previous pain shots they were working but this time it made it worse.
PATIENT: And this time it just made it worse.  So that's why I'm.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I had a, you know we had a disagreement of words
because first of all he was kind of telling me to try to give me some pill to put me to sleep.  That's supposed to leave you like a.
DOCTOR: Oh was it a muscle relaxer?
PATIENT: No, no, it's used for depression.  I told him no.  And it's no, for one there's no sleeping pills that work, supposed to make me sleep unless it's like a horse tranquilizer to knock me out but sleeping pills don't seem to work on me.  I don't, they'll knock me out for about the most, the maximum is maybe four hours and that's maximum.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Well.
PATIENT: And I can take a really high dose, it still will not work.
DOCTOR: Got it.  So you’re taking gabapentin.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You're not taking that any more?
PATIENT: No I stopped taking the gabapentin.  I told them that since four months ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It was the beginning of summer because they were, the ones that I had I had to gradually put them down because I couldn't stop taking them because they were giving me an epileptic attack so I gradually had to stop, that's what the doctor told me.  So I gradually stopped you know, started taking less and less and less until finally because I stopped for the simple reason.
DOCTOR: Do you have a history of epilepsy?
PATIENT: No but they say if I stop taking the gabapentin.
DOCTOR: Oh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The doses that I was at that that could happen.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But.
DOCTOR: Are you taking the Vicodin right now?
PATIENT: I take the Vicodins.
DOCTOR: How much?
PATIENT: The Vicodins I take, I take one to two depending on the pain.
DOCTOR: How many times a day?
PATIENT: A day I take it maybe three times a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, what about.
PATIENT: Two to three times depending.  Now the.
DOCTOR: What about the morphine?
PATIENT: The morphines I was taking them as scheduled but I noticed that um.
DOCTOR: So you're not taking it?
PATIENT: When I don't take them.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I get a tremendous knee, like joint pains, pains in my joints.  I get uh I guess that's the side effect of it but I get tremendous joint pain.
DOCTOR: Okay so are you taking it now or not?
PATIENT: Yes I've been taking one to two a day only.
DOCTOR: One to two a day.
PATIENT: I'm taking; I do take more of the Vicodins than I do take.
DOCTOR: Do you take the morphine 15 mg?
PATIENT: The 15 mg.
DOCTOR: When was the last time you got if filled?  Are you still taking, do you still have some?
PATIENT: I had some left, I just finished running out of them because last month they were gonna give them to me and I said no I just want to talk to them because I really didn't want to talk to that guy.  He really wasn't.
DOCTOR: The Pain Clinic was giving you Vicodin?
PATIENT: The Pain, yeah they said that they were going to transfer everything down here to the doctor because I just simply didn't want to talk to the guy.  The guy was in, he just kept with this thing that he wants to take me to um that I need to see a psychiatrist.  Why do I need to see a psychiatrist?  Oh it's part of the pain management.  Okay its part of the pain management and I can understand that but I don't want to see a psychiatrist.  Well you have no choice.  What do you mean I don't have no choice?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: No come on now, you trying to take me to go see a psychiatrist I have a physical problem not a mental problem.
DOCTOR: I understand.
PATIENT: Okay now I tried to explain that to him.  I says yes I do get stressed out.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I was stressed out at the time.  It took, it took the people here, it took them for about an hour and a half just to give me a really mild dose of something that was supposed to be an anti-depressant because I kept telling them I am not depressed.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I am stressed out.
DOCTOR: Got it.
PATIENT: Stressed.  I was living in a garage.
DOCTOR: Do you live [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yes, I have my own place.  You see my blood pressure went down.  My blood pressure was going high because [REDACTED] I'm frustrated.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know I'm not depressed because if I would've been depressed I would have been looking like I lived in a garage.  I maintained myself.  I always maintain myself you know.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Mentally, physically.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Let me just look at this.  So basically you were taking Vicodin instead of the morphine?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Got it.
PATIENT: And then I ran out so I had no choice but to take, what did the urine come out?
DOCTOR: So you ran out of Vicodin?
PATIENT: When I ran out of the Vicodin.
DOCTOR: The Vicodin.
PATIENT: Because I usually have.
DOCTOR: So do you want to go back on Vicodin?
PATIENT: I want to go back to the Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: There's very little of the morphine.  Half of the morphine as a matter of fact, the pills of the morphine.  Because I only take them like once in a while.  If I really start feeling a lot of pain and I see that the Vicodin is not helping because I can only take a certain amount a day and I don't like to have it like two, three days taking that big amount of it so I try to take a morphine to kind of you know the Vicodins because the Vicodin can handle it.  I don't want my liver [REDACTED].  I drink a lot of water you know so.  And I drink mineral water which is good and I drink a lot of tea.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Tea is very good.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know that because you stopped the gabapentin but the medication that he also gave you amitriptyline actually we do prescribe it for people with that kind of nerve pain, the physical nerve pain you know.  The medicines have different uses for them and not everything has to be.
PATIENT: That's the one, the anti-depression one that he supposedly.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's classified, technically for marketing purposes it is classified as neuropathic pain but um we do use that for neuropathic pain. If you don't want to use the gabapentin.
PATIENT: Then I can use that.
DOCTOR: Yeah you could use that actually.
PATIENT: So he said one pill to go to sleep though, that's what he told me.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let me just see if I can.  Oh I see.  Um did he offer a second injection?  I guess you didn't want it from him right?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do you want it with someone else?  So do you want to go back to the clinic, do you want to see someone else?  Is that what it is?
PATIENT: I wanted the guy that did it before not him.
DOCTOR: Okay but you were okay with someone else?
PATIENT: Yeah, yes, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Not that guy.
PATIENT: No I just want the.
DOCTOR: Okay um.
PATIENT: Yeah because sometimes I go there and it's like you notice in the records it's never the same guy.
DOCTOR: So they did try but I'll put another consult in and see and you would like to have it be to repeat injection and I'll make sure you know you can specify it or when they call to make the appointment you can always.  The name of the person was DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay, if it's possible just be like oh no DOCTOR just be like I would like it with another Pain Clinic doctor other than DOCTOR.
PATIENT: The best person they had up there was DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: So just request DOCTOR, how do you spell it?
PATIENT: DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: I'll put it in.
PATIENT:
DOCTOR: he's moved, he's gone.
DOCTOR: So who else is there?
PATIENT: Uh the ones from before him, the German guy, is he German?
DOCTOR: I don't know, I don't know people.
PATIENT: I don't either.
DOCTOR: How about DOCTOR?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is he good?
PATIENT: Uh the one from, not December, the one from three months ago.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's him.  The last injection I think I had was either in September or October.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Whoever that doctor was.
DOCTOR: DOCTOR?
PATIENT: There you go.
DOCTOR: You want him?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay then I'll refer to him.
PATIENT: Much better.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Sometimes you can go see online what they have over there you know I mean.
PATIENT: It varies.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Never the same person right.
DOCTOR: Yeah we're fine.  Alright.  So you need refills of everything.
PATIENT: Yes ma'am.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And if you can give me more of Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um for you, it's sort of like well I'll meet the patient and I'm like oh maybe Vicodin will need to be filled but you're really taking the steps to improve the pain.  You definitely have very severe lumbar back pain.
PATIENT: Right I do.
DOCTOR: And you need the medicines so.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: That's fine okay.
PATIENT: That's just.
DOCTOR: That's fine.
PATIENT: But I'm also a very skeptic type of person.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: When it comes to medicine, I'm not a medicine person.
DOCTOR: No I think yeah.
PATIENT: That's why I'd rather have the you know the discussion with the doctor and let them know what I feel, how I feel about the medicine because if I don't then it'd just be like something that I just be like oh no that's not really doing me good.  It's just like okay like if you're, I don't like a certain beer cause it does me wrong and then all the fellows, that's all they drink now am I gonna drink the same beer just to be hanging out with them.  You understand?
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Even though it's tearing me apart.
DOCTOR: Did you go have physical therapy?
PATIENT: Uh physical no, but not to say that she told me to reschedule me and then also I would like to know if I can get rescheduled through cause I was supposed to have done my MRIs redone because it's been two years ago.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Because I missed my appointment.
DOCTOR: The last MRI of the lumbar spine was last year in February so it hasn't been two years, it's been one year.
PATIENT: The MRI?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Of the lumbar spine?
PATIENT: Oh because I came on an emergency I think it was.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: On the 24th, somewhere around there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's right I forgot I had came in on emergency.
DOCTOR: So I don't think you need another one.
PATIENT: No okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  And the cervical one do you still have a lot of neck pain?
PATIENT: The neck pain, it's even here, it's always there but the pressures not there.
DOCTOR: Got it.  So that's fine you don't have to get another one.
PATIENT: Yeah that's the main, the main thing is as long as I don't feel like I'm carrying a big elephant in my back and my neck I can deal with the crackling cause I do do the exercises every day.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Very good.
PATIENT: And I don't carry anything in my hands; I can't carry nothing in my hands.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I carry it in my shoulder cause if I carry it in my hands it hurts my shoulders.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And if I carry it on my shoulders it doesn't hurt my shoulders but if I carry it in my hands it hurts my shoulders.  Totally backwards.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm gonna listen to you okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: No other problems, you been doing okay?
PATIENT: I been doing good.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me just make sure, excellent.  Deep breath, again.  No loss of your bowel or bladder, pain in your chest?
PATIENT: No [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh I won't [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: For some reason why is I can't sit like, like.
DOCTOR: Stand up for me.
PATIENT: Like some people like sit back and put, like okay, like okay if I sit like this where I have pressure on my back I can't do that for too long but for some reason it's like, like I'm building up the whole pressure it ends up like all the way up here.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: Yeah so I can't lay in the bed now, like the guys laying there the bed like put the pillow there because by some reason the pressure.  I don't know if it's the nerves.
DOCTOR: Yeah because it's like when you put your head back it further closing the disk space so that there's already a narrowing there sustained.
PATIENT: Oh that's what caused that.
DOCTOR: You're narrowing it a little bit more and that's how you've got pressure.
PATIENT: Woo cause boy does it and it hurts really bad.
DOCTOR: That's why, yeah.
PATIENT: If feel like I have a really bad headache.
DOCTOR: That's why and you can't really bend down?  You don't have to bend down as much.
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: Is it hard?
PATIENT: Bend down it's like okay.
DOCTOR: Okay don't bend down if you're gonna hurt yourself.
PATIENT: No but sometimes I have to do that because of the side, the whole thing.
DOCTOR: You can sit back up okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'll be right back.
PATIENT: But it's not the bending down so much it's this that bothers me, it’s like, you know like washing the sink when you wash the dishes or something, you tend to be very a little bit tilted.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Lasts maybe 15 seconds or so.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll be back.
PATIENT: Something like that and then that's really bad the pain.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It's [REDACTED].  Okay.
PATIENT: That's pretty awesome.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll be right back, no problem.
PATIENT: Yeah alright thank you.
(DOCTOR OUT: 62:03  DOCTOR IN:  74:00)
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I'll put a Pain consult back in.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and then I'll put, what was that person’s name? NAME?
PATIENT: You’ve got some big eyelashes.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: (Laughter) My granddaughter is the same way too.
DOCTOR: Oh.  Okay and I'll order the amitriptyline for you and you can try it and see and, [REDACTED], if it doesn't work, it doesn’t work, you know.  But it is something that can be useful for neuropathic pain if you don't want to take the, the gabapentin  should be really good, but if you don't want to take that, that’s fine,  then we can try something else.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: If you don't want to take that, it's totally up to you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: We try to find something that's comfortable.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Okay.  Do you need refills on the amlodipine?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You do?
PATIENT: Which one is that one?
DOCTOR: The blood pressure.
PATIENT: The blood pressure one uh no because I still got some at home I [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: One to two a day so that would be okay if you want to be seen it would be 90 pills.
