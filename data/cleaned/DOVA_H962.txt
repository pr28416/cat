DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yeah, that was weird.
DOCTOR: How are you doing?
PATIENT: Fine.  I heard my name, I heard my name.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: And then I didn't, it went right by me for a minute.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll be back in 30 seconds.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How are you doing today?
PATIENT: I'm hurting.
DOCTOR: What's that?
PATIENT: I'm hurting.
DOCTOR: Where?
PATIENT: On my arm, shoulder, chest and neck.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I fell yesterday.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Outside over a curb.
DOCTOR: Ooh okay.  Were you just walking or?
PATIENT: Yes, I don't know what it was from, if I tripped over the curb or fell in a hole.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know the curb outside where there's just curbs and sometimes there's no pavement.
DOCTOR: Right, right, right.
PATIENT: I remember seeing the curb.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And the next thing I remember I was on the ground in a lot of pain.
DOCTOR: Okay did you lose consciousness?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Where did you hit yourself?  What part of your body hit the ground?
PATIENT: Um I think the front part.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um like the front, left side.
DOCTOR: Did you hit your head?
PATIENT: Um I don't think so but it hurt.
DOCTOR: Your head it hurts?
PATIENT: Yeah from I, you know from hitting the ground.
DOCTOR: Um okay we'll get back to that, just one second.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Besides for that anything else new, meaning any new hospitalizations since I saw you last which was.
PATIENT: Oh no, no.
DOCTOR: Not very long ago.  I saw you back in June.  Um you have an occasional beer, you don't smoke correct?
PATIENT: Correct.
DOCTOR: And we'll go through your medications in just a second.  Did you get a flu shot already?
PATIENT: Yes I got one yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay her or somewhere else?
PATIENT: Here yeah.
DOCTOR: And you had some labs that you got this morning and they're still pending.
PATIENT: It was just done.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah so I'll take a look at that whenever it's back.  Um let's go through your medications first and make sure that you're up-to-date, you have enough refills and you’re taking  what you should be taking.  So the top of the list is cyclobenzaprine, that's the muscle relaxant.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Are you still taking that?
PATIENT: Yes I am.
DOCTOR: Okay and that helps?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Next is enalapril, that's for blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yes I'm taking those.
DOCTOR: Okay you take that twice a day.
PATIENT: Twice a day.
DOCTOR: Okay that also helps protect the kidneys for diabetics.  Your blood pressure is a little high today, 140/82 did you take it this morning.
PATIENT: Yeah, normally when I first come in its high.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But then when it's checked later in the visit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's back to normal.
DOCTOR: Okay I will check it again then.  Um then you have insulin for your diabetes.
PATIENT: I wanted to talk to you about my insulin.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's like it's not even working.
DOCTOR: Why is that?
PATIENT: My um readings are high.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I think last time; let me see what was down here the last time.
PATIENT: And I've been taking 40 units of let's see [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Of the insulin?  There’s two?
PATIENT: Its 30 Glargine, I take 40 units.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And the [REDACTED] I take 30 in the evening.
DOCTOR: Glargine you're taking 30?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And at night or in the morning?
PATIENT: Oh at night.
DOCTOR: At night and then the regular.
PATIENT: Regular.
DOCTOR: The Novolin you're taking in the evening.
PATIENT: Yeah 30, no Glargine is 30 and the regular is 20 yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay um.
PATIENT: Now if I take the regular, like after dinner, sometimes I forget to take it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then I may get a low about 5 in the morning.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You have to be careful.  It's not good to take it after dinner cause you're already taking the Glargine in the evening and both of those together will cause you to have low blood sugars.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you have to work on that.  You're hemoglobin A1c last time that I saw you was really high and I think I called and tried to leave you a message so that you're gonna have to increase your insulin which you have been slowly doing but it was way too high, it was 10.1, that's not good.
PATIENT: Just.
DOCTOR: Back in June so the one from today is still pending.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Sometimes it takes a long time to come back but I don't expect it will be, I mean it might be higher.  I don't expect it will be much lower and I would like to send you to the, unfortunately since I only have clinic once every five weeks I can't follow up with patients that often but I would like to send you to the pharmacist who can help manage diabetic medications.
PATIENT: The Pharm-D.
DOCTOR: Yeah have you done that before?
PATIENT: I tried.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But um.  I never had a call back.
DOCTOR: They should, I mean I would put in a consult and I would talk with them.  They will call you and sometimes they like to meet you once in person.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But after that you know they can do it over the phone but it usually shows a lot of, I mean it's beneficial because they can follow up with you like once every two weeks.  I can't do that.
PATIENT: Oh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And it goes faster and your hemoglobin A1c has been living at too high of levels for too long, that's not good you know and obviously what you're saying you're taking all of this insulin and it's not making much of a difference.  So we have to work on that.
PATIENT: Well that's, would it make sense to use the old insulin that I used to take?
DOCTOR: What did you used to take?
PATIENT: Um NovoLog and.
DOCTOR: NPH.
PATIENT: NPH.
DOCTOR: Um maybe but then you'd be taking it more often.  I like Glargine better cause it lasts in your system longer um but with the Glargine, you're taking it once a day there's room to do it twice a day for people that, your blood sugars are just very high.
PATIENT: Would it um, would it be beneficial to take more than 20 or like 40?
DOCTOR: No you can take as much as you need to.  I mean some people go up to 100 you know.
PATIENT: Okay cause my syringes go to 50.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean.
PATIENT: So sometimes I can only go down.
DOCTOR: Yeah, no, no, there's room to go up especially if your sugars are really high.  I mean the goal for a fasting glucose in the morning is 80-100.
PATIENT: Oh my.
DOCTOR: You know so you should be at that goal every day.  If you're not that means you don't have enough insulin.  Um but we have to kind of get it under control.  You're only 55, you shouldn't have a hemoglobin A1c that is that high you know.  So if it's okay I would like to send you to the.
PATIENT: Okay sure.
DOCTOR: Pharmacist because they can, I've seen a lot of good results when they work with patients you know and it's not forever it's just until we can get this under control.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: So um do you check your feet every day?
PATIENT: Um not um.
DOCTOR: The bottoms of your feet.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: For blisters and things, okay.
PATIENT: I look at them.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But not on a regular basis.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I can do that I guess.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, regular okay.  Try to do that just because you fell.  Like there's obviously some issues going on in your feet right.  You use the cane, you have some neuropathy because of the diabetes and a lot of other issues so I don't want you falling more than you do.  It's easy to get cuts and sores that you don't realize.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: So you need to check your foot you know.  It's recommended for all diabetics to check their um, the bottoms of their feet every day.  The other thing I wanted to ask you, actually let's sorry keep going through your medications.  Do you still have the lithium that you're taking?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And you're following with Psych for those?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay um okay and next we have the metoprolol 100 twice a day, that's for blood pressure and prostate.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Niacin 500, two tablets every day, that's for cholesterol.
PATIENT: I get that from you right, the niacin?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's for the yeah I get that.  Rosuvastatin.
DOCTOR: Rosuvastatin that's for cholesterol as well.  Um triamcinolone cream do you see Dermatology?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good.  Um venlafaxine that is also by Psych.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then you take Coumadin?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And what was the Coumadin again cause you've got a history of clots?
PATIENT: Yeah, Factor 5 Leiden.
DOCTOR: Okay um and Ambien, that's the Zolpidem for sleep.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay and then you have uh other medications that you don't take from here but you take fatty acids?
PATIENT: Yes um Omega 3.
DOCTOR: Yep that's fine and then multivitamins?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's it.
PATIENT: Senior formula.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other medications that I missed?  I don't think so.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay I'm sorry; let me return this page really quick.  (Doctor makes phone call)
PATIENT: Um.  I ain't seen them in a while.
DOCTOR: You what?
PATIENT: I haven't seen them in a while.
DOCTOR: Yes you have to go back and see them once a year, all diabetics once a year.  You have to call and make an appointment.  Um I'm [REDACTED].  Actually let me have you sit up here I'm gonna take your blood pressure again.  And you still have to get those records of your colonoscopy from Elmhurst in 2005 otherwise I'm just gonna give you a colonoscopy here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay open your mouth.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Can you take off your glasses for me?  Look at my nose.  Deep breaths.  Did you get any bruises or anything from when you fell since you're on Coumadin?
PATIENT: Um just the one from my arm, it was only a scrape.
DOCTOR: Have you always had?
PATIENT: Oh it's several years I've had those.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I want to do a few more tests.  Can you raise your eyebrows for me high okay good and then can you close your eyes shut tight, really tight and don't let me open them okay good and then can you smile good.  Can you stick out your tongue; can you move it from side to side?  Good and then one more time say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Put your tongue down.  One more time ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Good and then can you feel me touching on both sides of your face?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay I'm gonna make some noises by your ears; tell me which side you hear it on.  Do you hear it?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do you hear this?  Has your hearing always been an issue?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you hear this?
PATIENT: Oh I hear you now yeah.
DOCTOR: You can hear okay.  Both sides, one side?
PATIENT: Both sides.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right now.
DOCTOR: No?
PATIENT: Now it's on the right side.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Both sides.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um can you put your glasses back on?  Okay bring your arms up like this, don't let me push, sorry.  Is that too painful on your shoulders?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  And remind me again what happened with the shoulders that's why, it was recent or have you always had this?
PATIENT: Um well I had, I had surgery on this side.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: For three, three torn tendons.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then the right side was always called diabetic neuropathy.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Can you squeeze my hands as tight as you can with your fingers?  Good.  I'm gonna lift your knee up straight then bend.  You can bend; no you can bend your knee, straing, good.  Great, bend good.  Lift your leg up against my hand, you can't really do that?  You've never been able to do that with me.
PATIENT: I have been trying.  I used to be strong in my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um let me look at your chart for a minute.  [REDACTED] now?
PATIENT: Um no.
DOCTOR: No.  Okay your only labs that we got, your potassium is a little bit high 5.6 um and your glucose is very high, 546, not good.
PATIENT: What should it be?
DOCTOR: Uh like 100.  You're diabetic so it's gonna be higher.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But 546 is really high so I'm expecting your hemoglobin A1c to be even worse today.  No it's not, 9.9.  Let me go quickly talk with my attending and see what we need to do.  I don't think that it's something critical that we have to like keep you here to fix the sugars but I do want you to see the pharmacist soon.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: When you take more insulin at home, so that when you check your sugars it's always less than 200.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know.  That's hard to figure out, that's why I'm saying I want you to see the pharmacist cause it's hard to just talk about doing it and after go home then you're gonna have questions about it and I can't see you for five weeks, that's not gonna help.  Um but normally we don't like to just increase tons of it cause we don't want you to have side effects or your sugars will go too low.
PATIENT: Oh sure.
DOCTOR: You know so at 546 you've got a lot of room for your sugars to go down um and you did not eat this morning correct?
PATIENT: Did not eat no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um hmm oh your blood pressure.  So it's the same 140/80.  You can sit over here.  You don't have any history of gout do you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You do.  You know when was that?
PATIENT: Um 85.
DOCTOR: And it was for sure gout?
PATIENT: Yeah, it was diagnosed yeah as gout and they did that needle[REDACTED].  Is that lactic acid?
DOCTOR: Uric acid.
PATIENT: Uric acid.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Okay.  I'll be right back.  Let me talk with my attending and uh find out what he wants to do.  And you were in a motor vehicle accident back in 1986 correct?
PATIENT: Yeah that's correct.
DOCTOR: Did you have any issues since then because of like has it affected your strength or anything like that?
PATIENT: Um yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then you have that VP shunt correct?
PATIENT: Correct.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: 55:25  DOCTOR IN:  66:56
DOCTOR: Okay so a few things.  I'm gonna have the pharmacist call you and they'll try to see you within the next week.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay but in the meantime we're gonna make a few changes to your Glargine, the one you take in the evening.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: How much are you taking now, you said 30?
PATIENT: 30.
DOCTOR: Okay so you're gonna do 35, 35 units 30 minutes before dinner oh I'm sorry before bedtime and then the regular insulin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You're only taking it once in the evening correct?
PATIENT: Correct.
DOCTOR: Do you eat regular meals?  Breakfast, lunch, dinner?
PATIENT: Uh usually yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so this is a shorter acting insulin so we can take it with every meal but you have to take it 30 minutes before your meal.
PATIENT: 30 minutes before?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause it takes a little bit of time to kick in.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But if you take it right when you start eating it's not really gonna help then you're gonna go low afterwards.  So what I want you to do and I'm gonna update this so they send you enough insulin to your house.  You don't have to pick it up today unless you want to, it's up to you.
PATIENT: Yeah I can sure.
DOCTOR: You want to pick it up today?  Okay so you're gonna take 5 units for breakfast 30 minutes before breakfast.  You're gonna take another 5 units 30 minutes before lunch and then you're gonna take the normal 12 that you take.  You're taking how much before dinner right now?
PATIENT: Um, um 20.
DOCTOR: 20.  You can keep doing that, 20 units um.  What are your sugars in the morning when you wake up, what do you think?
PATIENT: Um 170.
DOCTOR: 170.
PATIENT: 17.
DOCTOR: 117.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: You can keep on the 20 units um before dinner.  If you're waking up and you're noticing that your blood sugar is below 100 then obviously you'll have to cut back on some of this insulin.  You can call in, hopefully the pharmacist will see you soon but the point is that you have, your glucose this morning is 546, that's way too high.  So that means that most of the time you're probably in the morning your sugars are like in the 300s so you need a lot more insulin.  But we can’t just pound you with tons.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I don't want you to go through that.
PATIENT: Right, right, right.
DOCTOR: So you're gonna do this until you see the pharmacist okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you need to bring me the records of your colonoscopy so I'm gonna write that on here, bring colonoscopy records along with, the most important part is pathology.  So once you get a colonoscopy done, if they ever remove anything, polyps, they send it down to the Lab, the pathology and they cut it up and look at it under a microscope.  That's what pathology is and that's the most important part.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You can't tell by the naked eye what the polyp is, there's different kinds of polyps.
PATIENT: Right, right, okay.
DOCTOR: And that tells us when you need to get screened for another colonoscopy okay.  Um I will put all these orders in.  You can go down to the Pharmacy if you want and get the insulin today.  Do you want to pick it up?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so I will put that in there, picking it up and I'll see you back.  I want to see you sooner just because we have a lot of issues to deal with; mostly the diabetes so I want to make sure it's corrected.  Um so um I'm gonna say three months.
PATIENT: Three months okay.
DOCTOR: Um okay.  So I'll give this to you.  Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Um I didn't check your cholesterol this time cause I didn't need to.  The other thing you can do if you're having pain with the shoulders because you fell.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Let me double check here, um your liver enzymes were a little bit higher so I don't know if you should still be taking Tylenol but you can take something like ibuprofen if you need to or Motrin so avoid Tylenol but um and you're already taking some muscle relaxants.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: You know all that stuff helps.  If you need to you can take one extra and hopefully this pain issue, the soreness will kind of go away okay.  I'm not really worried that you broke any bones or anything like that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Unless you tell me you can't breathe because you're having so much pain, but that's not true is it?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay um but if the pain is there, it's not going away, you notice any new bruises or anything like that you have to call and come in.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Potentially come in, you might have to get x-rays or something.
PATIENT: The only time I have um uh pain in my chest when breathing is when I go to the extreme, take a really deep breath.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But when I'm normal breath I don't feel pain.
DOCTOR: Okay is that like when I was asking you to take deep breaths and I was listening to your lungs or anything?  Try to take a deep breath now.
PATIENT: It hurts.
DOCTOR: Where does it hurt?
PATIENT: Like right in here.
DOCTOR: You fell on this side?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Maybe we should just go ahead and do an x-ray of the ribs to see if you broke anything.  What do you do for a broken rib, not much.  You just have to handle, manage the pain.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And try to make sure that you're breathing normally cause people when they have pain they don't breathe well enough and then your lungs kind of get weaker and it's easier to get infections and things like that.  So we can do an x-ray of the ribs but that would be today so you can go maybe pick up a sticker from Pharmacy and then go get your x-ray and go back to Pharmacy so that they have your medications ready by that time.  So let me put that in, a chest x-ray.
PATIENT: I usually take a walk, after I put in my thing at the Pharmacy, that's the best thing isn't it.  People are always complaining.
DOCTOR: Yeah alright.  I'll give this to you and you can go down to the counter.
PATIENT: Do I take this to the checkout?
DOCTOR: Yep, go around the corner.  You're gonna go down to your x-ray; actually let me write that on here.  They'll take you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay, thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay alright.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: 74:19
Time is 10:54.
