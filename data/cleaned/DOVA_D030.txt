DOCTOR: Good to see you.
PATIENT: Isn't that cool?
DOCTOR: Are they [REDACTED] you?  Okay.  How are things going?
PATIENT: Uh pretty good, pretty good.
DOCTOR: Okay um so you're that heart test that you did was normal.  The one where they, it was done at the end of January.
PATIENT: The echogram?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That echogram.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED] wanted to ask you [REDACTED] his heart.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I got a pretty good heart and you know that's, you know I have a good heart [REDACTED] muscle.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Gets the blood everywhere.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] sure.  Any problems since I last saw you?
PATIENT: Uh no not really.  You know but one thing I'm really concerned about and [REDACTED] I take my blood pressure at home occasionally.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And sometime my heart race, it's up to like 52, is that kind of too low or?
DOCTOR: Well if you have any symptoms from it?  In terms of do you feel lightheaded at all?
PATIENT: No, no, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um any.
PATIENT: But you know, I know you can look at my records uh in February I spent a couple of days in the hospital here because I did pass out.
DOCTOR: Right yeah.
PATIENT: But I think they agreed with me like I just got overheated.  I told them I got real hot and I just stopped and sat down and the next thing I know they were putting cold [REDACTED] somebody and uh they said I was out for maybe a minute, not even a minute, you know just half a minute so.
DOCTOR: Yeah there's lots of reasons why you can um be, why you can pass out.  Sometimes it's you're heart but it's not always.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I would say, you know there was one time you were here when it was reported in the 50s but it looks like you're consistently you know in the 60s or 70s which is actually good.  It means the medication's working.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's what we want it to do , because the atenolol, that medication you're on protects your heart a little bit.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So um.
PATIENT: Well I'm like on a half a tablet only right now.
DOCTOR: I know yeah and you're on a small dose, that's right.
PATIENT: Yeah right.
DOCTOR: So I would say just continue.  You know if it were to recur again then we'll look at and when it does happen.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: If at that time your heart rate is low then we would consider stopping it but I think.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: When it happens your heart rate wasn't that low so it means that it wasn't that low, so just continue it.
PATIENT: Okay, that's good, that's really good.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Um so the other thing I'm going to send you vitamin D pills.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, I was supposed to have that a long time but you know I just bought some and so I taking them, I think [REDACTED] 800 units.
DOCTOR: Oh you do.
PATIENT: Something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Is it cheaper for you to buy them?
PATIENT: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: I get 400 in a bottle [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay so what I want you to do is um stop, I'm going to send these other, these concentrated pills uh just cause your level was borderline low so to get your numbers back into the normal range.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: And then we'll and then you could, so don't throw those pills that you have away.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: But I'll these send you these and you just take it once a week.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: For 12 weeks.
PATIENT: Don't take it with the other ones.
DOCTOR: Right just hold, put those aside for three months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then once you're done taking these once a week for 12 weeks.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Then start taking those.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and it should, you know now that's it's sunny outside that'll help your Vitamin D.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Help you.  I think all people who live in Chicago are Vitamin D deficient.
PATIENT: Yeah right.
DOCTOR: Um and otherwise no changes to any of your medications I think.  Your blood pressure looks good.  Your cholesterol is still at goal um.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then my only other question, you don't have a urology appointment until October right?
PATIENT: I don't know.  It's like once a year.  I don't know, I just wait until they call me.  It's only like a once a year basis now.
DOCTOR: Yeah they say in October and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: They wouldn't call me back until when, October?
DOCTOR: The urologist.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Put in a request for you to see them so.
PATIENT: Okay I'll just; I know I'll probably see you before then.
DOCTOR: Yeah you'll see me before.  Then you have, do you get your meds in three months supplies?
PATIENT: Uh-huh, 90 days, well 90 days yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Cause you have, it looks like you have enough refills then.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so, oh my only other question is do you know when your, I know you've had a colonoscopy.  Do you remember what year it was?
PATIENT: Uh probably two years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I think they said I'm good for five years so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: This time they did find some polyps the first time but you know they weren’t bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah and they take then out right then.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So it's just the, yeah I don't know let me just make sure that there's no other.  We just checked your blood so I don't think there's anything for me to look at but hmm.  Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Yes.  Well I have a question; I have something I would like for you to do for me.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I have to renew my handicapped sticker.  I have it because I have these arthritic knees and when I have to walk a long time, a long distance, it's like I'm only doing my walking in the day so I got a knee brace on to help me get up.  Uh it expired yesterday but I had, last time I was here I had the doctor fill out the form for me.  The Secretary of State wouldn't accept it because uh he put over here one year.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: See it's either permanent or six months and I have a permanent one.
DOCTOR: Do you have a new form or can I just [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No, no, no.  They wouldn't let me change that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I got a new form, see I got already had a permanent when they did the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: And uh I got a new form.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah let's do that then.
PATIENT: And they have to be filled out and they wouldn't accept this one because he put one year in there and I said what, can I just eliminate that?  I just is that what he said, probably just [REDACTED].  And I [REDACTED] handicapped [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You got to do all of this stuff and I see this was expired yesterday and I don't want to be getting no ticket for it.
DOCTOR: What did we put on the old one?
PATIENT: It's up here knee osteoarthritis is what they put.  Uh I don't know that it's terrible, I see that date of birth up here.
DOCTOR: Oh sure.
PATIENT: Does it call for that?
DOCTOR: This one is.
PATIENT: The one that says now that's what disability, that's why I come here, [REDACTED] permanent [REDACTED] right.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: Yeah but that's why we'll get this right.
DOCTOR: What's this on the bottom here?  Down here.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Oh.
DOCTOR: Now DOCTOR isn't here any more.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Did she tell you?
PATIENT: Uh no, no.
DOCTOR: There's somebody who replaced her and her name is DOCTOR.  [REDACTED] introduce herself.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We'll look at um okay.  This one.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'll have her fill this one out.
PATIENT: Alrighty.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Otherwise it looks like you're in good shape.
PATIENT: Alright.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Just sit up here for me, I'm gonna take a look at you.  Anything else I can do for you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No I think that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know it took a long time cause I had a 10 o'clock appointment and [REDACTED] could have done you know at least 30 minutes after my appointment now and I'm usually in and out.
DOCTOR: They told me they checked you in.  They had here you were at 10:30.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: When I came to look for you um and I couldn't find your [REDACTED] they had the paperwork and then it disappeared and so.
PATIENT: Yeah okay, I talked to two people out there and try to you know, like this guy with the heart thing and then talked to him.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: So maybe.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Maybe they pulled my papers while I'm talking with them or something I don't know.
DOCTOR: I think that's the problem cause I know you showed up early.
PATIENT: Oh yeah I was here long before 10 o'clock.
DOCTOR: And you were yeah.
PATIENT: Always, I'm always early.
DOCTOR: And maybe they took it yeah.  So that's.  Few deep breaths for me.  One more.  You sound good.
PATIENT: Okay.  Did I mention to you, I did mention to you about that low heart rate I get sometimes at home right?
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: But you said that's nothing to worry about huh?
DOCTOR: But if you feel, dizzy if that does happen.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Then um I would say you could just hold off on your atenolol.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: For a few days and see if it helps you.
PATIENT: I'll see.
DOCTOR: And you can always come back to Urgent Care.
PATIENT: Yeah, I'll keep track of that then.
DOCTOR: But yeah.  I'd say the best thing to do is take it, if you want to check it, take it first thing in the morning but you're on a small dose and your blood pressure is otherwise controlled so it's helping protect your heart a little bit but if you know, it you check it and it's low then you can stop it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh I'll check it and if it's low. You can always many an appointment to see me sooner.
PATIENT: I always check it first thing in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Right before I eat.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um yeah if you have no other problems I'll see you back in four months.
PATIENT: Okay [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah but let me go have DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Oh oh, okay yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] so she can have those [REDACTED].  So I'll see you in August.
PATIENT: Oh okay good.
DOCTOR: Four months.
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: About a week before you um, like a few days before the next appointment, come to the Lab and get your blood drawn and we'll check to make sure that vitamin D has been replaced.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: I suspect it should.
PATIENT: Uh and when I come to the Lab for that, I'm probably not going to be in the computer or anything.   I just go in there and I don't have to be right?
DOCTOR: Yes I'm putting in the computer right now.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: For um August.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So any time after August 1st you can come in and get that checked.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I [REDACTED] these other pills that will replace your low level.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll just make sure okay.
PATIENT: Okie dokie.
DOCTOR: Um okay.  So let me talk to my attending and I'll be right back.

PATIENT: Oh yeah I feel great too.
DOCTOR: Yeah you’re not leaving us much to do.

DOCTOR: Yeah but there's a couple things we can talk about but for the most part you're doing really well.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I just wanted to make sure that you met me.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So I'm always around but DOCTOR is taking good care of you.
PATIENT: Okay.  DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: DOCTOR.
PATIENT:
DOCTOR: .
DOCTOR: Okay take care.
PATIENT: Okay, sure will.
DOCTOR: Thank you.  Okay, so um I'm going to write your cholesterol numbers down so you have them on this paper.
PATIENT: Okay, the what now?
DOCTOR: Your cholesterol numbers, would you like to have them?
PATIENT: Yeah, do that, yeah, yeah that's a good idea.
DOCTOR: Okay this is a list of all your medications that you're on right now anyway so we'll just give you and um so all of your numbers look good.  So your total, [REDACTED] total cholesterol.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um HDL is the good cholesterol.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And remember H is for healthy.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: And it looks like you're 149 and then your LDL remember L for lethal, is your bad cholesterol.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Is 67 and so we want, so to meet your goal less than 200 you want this above 40, this one less than 150 and this is less than 70.
PATIENT: Above 40?
DOCTOR: So right, so there's no medication.  Well there is a medication that can raise it but the other thing that can raise it is doing aerobic exercise.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So either walking or riding a bike or something.
PATIENT: Kind like kills the walking.  Cause my wife gets up at 6 o'clock every morning and goes for a walk, oh maybe about a mile, mile and a half, with my neighbor.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I'm going to go so bad but I drop out about half a block because this knee is so bad.
DOCTOR: Oh right.  Now can you do swimming or biking?
PATIENT: Uh a stationary bike.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So if you just do it you know for about 20 or 30 minutes, enough to break a sweat.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You don't have to be drenching.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But you need to do that [REDACTED] and that'll help raise it.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: But this number is everything else looks good so I wouldn't say that this is low enough and these other numbers are not abnormal so I wouldn't.
PATIENT: Okay that should be up in the 70s?
DOCTOR: 40s.
PATIENT: Oh show I should go, I was looking at that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That means greater.  Greater than and less than.
PATIENT: Okay.  Okay, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So it's not low enough because [REDACTED] I wouldn’t put you on another medication.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  I'll see if I couldn't get it up by the next time I get here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.  Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, take care.
PATIENT: You have a nice day now.
DOCTOR: You too.
PATIENT: I don't have to check in at the desk?
DOCTOR: Nope, you don't have to check.  I'll send that medication in the mail.
PATIENT: Oh okay, very good.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] at 7.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah I'm going to go up and see them.
