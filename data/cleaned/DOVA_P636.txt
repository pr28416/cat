DOCTOR: PATIENT?  Hi how you doing?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: What can I help you with today?
PATIENT: I don't, they sent me a letter to come over here.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's just your regularly scheduled check-up?
PATIENT: I guess.  You know cause the last time I came the nurse said I asked when should I come back and she said well I don't see anything here, if we need you we'll call you and let you know.  Anyway.
DOCTOR: But if they just kind of get a letter we just set up a time.
PATIENT: Hmm, probably cause that they did they sent me a letter like a week before.  They send me a letter saying that I missed the appointment and I never had the appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then a week later, like just about a week later, they send me another letter and I open it up and I had this appointment.  So I'm here.
DOCTOR: I was just reading about last time.
PATIENT: You know but what I do need, if I can get it, is um uh lamisil cause I ran out like about two weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it was just starting to go away and uh.
DOCTOR: And it all came back?
PATIENT: Well no but it's just, what's going to happen I think it's going to come back. I got a feeling
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's not, I don't know, Iâ€™m not a doctor, just like it happened the last time it's and uh I need some more of those little pills for uh my uh blood pressure I think it was.
DOCTOR: Hydrochlorothiazide?
PATIENT: There you go, right, right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I still got some baby aspirins left so, I told her there were plenty there.
DOCTOR: Let's see the blood pressure looks good so we won't change any of that medicine and I saw the last time you went for the nursing visit the blood pressure was good there.  Um do you smoke?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And you were going to follow up with the Mental Health people right?
PATIENT: Oh you know I forgot about that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I did, I forgot about that and I don't think I've received anything this, you know to remind me of that.
DOCTOR: So they said they tried to call your phone and um the phone number is incorrect so.
PATIENT: You know what that was, it was the old phone.
DOCTOR: So is it PHONE NUMBER?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And that works now?
PATIENT: Yes.  That should work. This is downstairs, I mean [REDACTED] at the front office over here, when you first come in they uh they had a wrong number.  It was an old number.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Okay.  When they call, they come up Hines Hospital or something?
DOCTOR: It should.
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: (Doctor answers phone call).  So um, I was just looking through the labs that we've drawn.  Your PSA is normal, uh 2.24 and that's for your prostate cancer.
PATIENT: Oh okay.  Okay I have to check.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] that we get on most people um.  Are you okay with taking an aspirin every day?
PATIENT: That's what I've been doing.

PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh you know what, I could use a little more.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's not really as much but just a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I don't have to call in.  It kind of comes with taking a couple [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um, you still I guess, are you feeling at all, are you having like nightmares or things like that are intrusive or?
PATIENT: Sometimes, sometimes you know.  Yeah I fell asleep, just about two days ago, I fell asleep with the TV on and I don't know why, but you know I could, it seemed like I was having a bad dream and I woke up and you know I had tears in my eyes and what I was dreaming what was on the TV.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it was like and it was what happened with a Mel Gibson movie.  We Were Soldiers that was playing and then it was like sad and I just shut it off and insomnia, you know I stayed up for a while and then I went to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But it was hard.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and you're not thinking at all of like harming yourself or any others.
PATIENT: No, no, no.
DOCTOR: Would you say that the PTSD is uh not controlled, somewhat controlled or well controlled?
PATIENT: Well, it's, how would I say, it's controlled I guess.  But then again there's days where you know you just, whenever you see something or you know, something happened and it just clicks and something clicks and you know you just, you maybe not at home and it just happens and stuff that happened so I just have to deal with it and you know, just deal with it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh try to get home.  I'm fine in my home you know, [REDACTED] I'm at home but sometimes, I don't know some other guys carry on and sometimes it's okay and then I know when I got to leave and then I just go.
DOCTOR: So this is my card.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The number on the back there is the number for the Mental Health Center if you were ever to need anything quickly.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Um so what you do is you call into the normal VA number like you know the Vets Number.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I think its 1-800.
PATIENT: I have the card at home; I think I have it at home so.
DOCTOR: So if you dialed that, then when they ask you for an extension, you can dial that extension.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let me uh, I got to take this for a second.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: (Doctor answers a page).  Okay so I'll put that in and they'll contact you about scheduling that appointment.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Did you eat anything today?
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: If you ate.
PATIENT: Just coffee cake today you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I just had it with my coffee this morning, that's it.
DOCTOR: Whenever we ask you to get a cholesterol panel, we need you to be 14 hours fasting.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: I think I'll go ahead and order a cholesterol panel for you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And um next time you're at the VA for some reason, just get it drawn you know.
PATIENT: You mean a blood sample?
DOCTOR: Yeah a blood draw.
PATIENT: Oh go downstairs.
DOCTOR: You have to be fasting for 14 hours.  Which just means like after you finish dinner at night.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Don't eat anything else.
PATIENT: Don't eat anything else.
DOCTOR: And then you come in the morning, get your blood drawn and then you can eat breakfast.
PATIENT: Okay.  Uh I can do that next week sometime.
DOCTOR: Okay.  That'd be great.  Just because you know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um once you hit like 40-50 we like to start checking cholesterol and the urine and seeing whether or not we need to talk about diet changes or starting medication or something like that.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Uh blood pressure looks good and so I'll just restart the Lamisil and I'll have you follow up with the Mental Health people.
PATIENT: And for my blood pressure, hydro what are they?
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll reorder those.  And those are, you have refills of them.
PATIENT: Right so I just need to take a look at them, to tell you the truth actually.
DOCTOR: Okay well you have refills so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You can go downstairs to the Pharmacy and go tell them that you'd like your refills; you'd like to get refills.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Or you can call in.  It'd probably be best, you know if you're running out.
PATIENT: Can I just call them, this way if I come in next week, like say Tuesday or something like that I could pick them up?
DOCTOR: Well they mail them to your house.
PATIENT: Okay can I call and just pick them up because sometimes it takes a week, two weeks.
DOCTOR: I don't think you can call in and pick them up from here.
PATIENT: Oh no, oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I'll just have to call in and have them mail it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I'll see whether or not I can call down to the Pharmacy.  I've got to go talk to my attending.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: To see if I can call down to the Pharmacy and get that set up to be picked up before you leave.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath.  Okay.  Let me take a quick listen to your lungs.  Okay.  If I can just get you to lay back down.  [REDACTED].  Okay, sit up.  I was reading one of the notes, you drink about 4-5 beers per day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] but just about every day.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and you know you can talk to the Mental Health people about that but I mean a little bit more alcohol than you know we like to be comfortable with.  You know that being said um, if you're drinking that much, you know I don't think that's to the level of alcoholism but it is to the level that is you know somewhat concerning and I guess my biggest concern is that you're on the Lamisil.  Lamisil can already cause problems with your liver.
PATIENT: Oh is that right?
DOCTOR: Yeah so um the alcohol would just kind of be more of an insult that are causing problems there.
PATIENT: Oh.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I mean try to keep it on the, you know the lighter side.
PATIENT: Yeah alright.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh like I mean, just this is double check, you are drinking.
PATIENT: That's one of the reasons I go to the post you know.
DOCTOR: You're going to go where?
PATIENT: American Legion Post.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: A number of vets there and.
DOCTOR: And everyone drinks there.
PATIENT: Yeah you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Watching the games, things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um, how often would you say you drink to the point of um like intoxication, being drunk?
PATIENT: Well, really as far as to intoxication it's for more like uh only when like holidays.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not really even holidays.  Uh once in a while I mean there's nothing, I don't know how often.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Once in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I just wanted to make sure that you know with your diagnosis of PTSD.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um you're at a little bit higher risk for um getting into some stronger alcohol problems.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um so it's just a concern.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I just want to make sure you're not like medicating yourself with alcohol for the PTSD.
PATIENT: No, no.  She won't let me.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Your wife or?
PATIENT: No girlfriend yeah.
DOCTOR: Girlfriend okay, good.  It's like men live longer when they have wives or girlfriends.
PATIENT: She like.
DOCTOR: Women live shorter so I always tell my girlfriend that men suck the life out of women.
PATIENT: Oh man she just comes, whenever she feels like it.  She has her own place like kind of whenever she comes in, and out and like yeah I'm just keeping an eye on you and I said alright, I know.
DOCTOR: Um, I'll have to be right back.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: I'm going to go talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back.
(DOCTOR OUT:  74:55  DOCTOR IN:  79:47)
DOCTOR: Okay.  Can I take a look at your nails?  So this stuff is growing in here, is like new nail.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: That should eventually grow out.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And the stuff that's all dystrophic like this.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Will, you'll just eventually cut it off.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you have good nail coming in here, normal you know live nail.
PATIENT: Oh I won't need it.
DOCTOR: No and.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: If you do if it comes back we can treat it again.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh but let's just see cause like I said you know it's not a totally benign drug.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: It can cause liver problems.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: It's just [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Alright, okay, thanks.
DOCTOR: As far as the trazodone, how many pills are you taking per day?
PATIENT: Uh oh it depends you know.  Sometimes I have to take three of them.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause you now I.
DOCTOR: Three full pills or three half pills?
PATIENT: Three full pills.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You're only supposed to be taking one per day.
PATIENT: Once doesn't do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It doesn't and, it doesn't do anything sometimes.  I have to take like two of them sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then.
DOCTOR: It's as if they don't get you to the level where you're able to go to sleep?
PATIENT: No, I can't.  I still, I'll go to sleep, I mean I won't.  I don't want to go to sleep.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it's not like I can't go to sleep.  You know before I used to take it and just go to sleep.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I guess I have to like make myself go to sleep and then I can't go to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just I don't know, it's not working.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's why I just take two, three, whatever I need at the time is what I take.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Let me go talk to DOCTOR one more time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: See what he wants to do about that.
(DOCTOR OUT:  81:30  DOCTOR IN:  83:18)
DOCTOR: So the maximum dose for those is 400 mg per day.
PATIENT: Per day.
DOCTOR: Per day.  I'll put in an order for you to get.
PATIENT: Cause I know uh, what was I using?  I used to take when I was in North Chicago or even over there at West Side I was getting I think it was 200 mg per, I think it was 200 or 250, I'd take two pills.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they were I think like 100 a piece or something like that, I forgot what they were it's been a while.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But that's what I was getting when I was started at West Side or now at Jesse Brown but anyway um then when I went to Great Lakes, North Chicago there I was still taking those cause that's what they told me to take and I was taking them there.  That's it.
DOCTOR: So I think itâ€™s okay for you to take two or three per day and I.
PATIENT: See I don't take it every day, every day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Only when I really need it cause I know they're not habit-forming or anything but I just you know.
DOCTOR: And also I want you to stop napping during the day.
PATIENT: How'd you guess?
DOCTOR: Cause everyone your age naps during the day.  So that's a problem is you'll be napping during the day and then you get like half of your sleep in and then you try your hardest to get to sleep at night and it's frustrating and eventually you fall asleep and then three hours later you wake up again.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And you wake up again because you slept three hours earlier in the day and so now you've gotten your six hours for the day so your body's like we're done sleeping and you're like it's only 3 in the morning I need to go back to sleep.
PATIENT: I know and that helps watching TV.
DOCTOR: Instead set a pot of coffee out for maybe a few days.
PATIENT: I do.
DOCTOR: And drink that during the day and keep yourself up but the main thing is staying active so, you know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: For at least a while try to find somewhere to go and go take a walk.  I know it's hot out but you know or go to the store and go to like Home Depot and walk around for a while.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah and find you know something, a hobby to do.
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: Something to keep you awake during the day.
PATIENT: Really what I do.
DOCTOR: You get your schedule kind of flipped if you stop napping during the day and you stay awake at night, then that'll help.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Also another problem that people have is that they drink a ton of coffee in the morning and they're wide awake and they're rearing to go and then 2 o'clock and crash.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So what you got to do is drink less coffee in the morning and maybe have another little bit of coffee in the afternoon.
PATIENT: Okay.  They serve coffee at the Post.  A lot of times, weâ€™ll see.
DOCTOR: You spend a lot of time at the Post.
PATIENT: Well you know what, I what I do there I uh I clean up.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Keep me busy, keeps me doing something you know.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: So I clean up, I load the beer. Do odds and ends there and there are two of us.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And this is what we do every day.
DOCTOR: So yeah, it's.
PATIENT: Then I go home.
DOCTOR: And you fall asleep?
PATIENT: No, well yeah and then I go home and go to sleep.  You know I'm watching and I doze off and I don't even know what's going on you know I just wake up, I don't even know what time it is.  Holy shit I fell asleep for two hours and I don't believe this.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I might be sitting there watching TV and I don't know, I just fall asleep.  Girlfriend she's there watching TV, she's on the couch and I'm like on the loveseat there and watching TV and watching TV and then you know and she'll get up and sometimes she just nudges me, get up, get up, you're falling asleep again.
DOCTOR: Yeah, thatâ€™s what you gotta avoid.  So if you feel yourself kind of falling asleep like that, you got to get yourself up and do something like.  You know sometimes I'll go with my girlfriend and go for a walk.  Just go for a walk around the block you know.  It doesn't need to be real long but like 15 minutes of moving around helps stimulate you know your body cause otherwise after dinner, as soon as I eat dinner or as soon as I eat lunch, I'll fall asleep.
PATIENT: Oh man I'm like that.
DOCTOR: Yeah everyone does that.  So you got to come up with some methods otherwise you're just going to be up all night too.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright you're all set.
PATIENT: Alright sounds good.
DOCTOR: I'll see you back in how long, when do you want to see me, a couple of months?
PATIENT: Yeah, whenever you think is good.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's do.
PATIENT: Do I need to take this any place?
DOCTOR: Yeah you take it up front.
PATIENT: Oh up front.
DOCTOR: Yeah so as far as the medications go, um you can't call in to our Pharmacy.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And pick up medicine so.
PATIENT: So I have to call it in and wait till they send it.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Or you can go downstairs and try to grab it right now.  I would just check and see, maybe at 2 o'clock you know um, there may not be that many people waiting down there.
PATIENT: Just go down there.  I'll probably do that.
DOCTOR: I'd like you not to miss any of your blood pressure pills.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'd rather you take the whole, it kind of negates the whole thing.
PATIENT: Yeah I have like only, I think like four left.
DOCTOR: Yeah so you're going to have to pick up some downstairs.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you can go up there [REDACTED] and then go grab a cup of coffee downstairs [REDACTED] and then come back and then pick them up.  Okay.  Take care okay.  Let me know if you have any problems.
PATIENT: Okay I sure will.
