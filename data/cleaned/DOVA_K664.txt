PATIENT: No, those went away.
DOCTOR: Were you having fevers before?
PATIENT: Yeah first two days.
DOCTOR: Did you measure it; was your temperature actually high?
PATIENT: It wasn't high but it was at just borderline.
DOCTOR: What was it?
PATIENT: It was uh 100 over something.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure or your temperature?

PATIENT: No, no, that was my blood pressure.  I forgot what my temperature was.
DOCTOR: Okay but no fevers or chills right now um any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No you just said when you cough you get a little dizzy.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Does that go away after you stop coughing?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It hurts when I cough too.  My head hurts.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Is anyone at home sick?
PATIENT: No I'm the only person staying in my place.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Does this feel like its getting better or it's been about the same?
PATIENT: I think it's getting a little better.  It's better than the first two days you know, I was taking Alka-Seltzer Plus.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I had some cough syrup that I had from the last visit.
DOCTOR: Yeah did that help?
PATIENT: Yeah it helped.
DOCTOR: So it's mostly the cough and then when you cough you're getting a little bit of a headache.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um going on for like seven days.  No fevers at all, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that.
PATIENT: No, chest pains yes.
DOCTOR: With the cough?
PATIENT: Yeah with the cough but before I got sick this whole left side from the arm got real stiff and this sharp pain went all the way up to the shoulder where I couldn't even lift my shoulder.
DOCTOR: Okay are you still having that?
PATIENT: Yeah in both shoulders now.
DOCTOR: Just shoulder pain?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so where, it's just pain it's just right here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me see something.  How bad is the shoulder pain on a scale from 1-10?
PATIENT: 7.
DOCTOR: But it's in both shoulders?
PATIENT: Yeah.  And at times both my hands stiffen up a lot.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Did you hurt your shoulders at all?  Have you been doing any heavy lifting at all?  What do you do for work?  Do you work?
PATIENT: No I was in a car accident in 2006 that left me in a coma.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then I got screws and wires in both of my ankles.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh plate holder in my hip.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But with the shoulders, were those hurt in the accident too?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Have those hurt ever since the accident?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is this different?  And how long has it been worse for?
PATIENT: It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But no new injury or anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I notice I can't even do an arm curl with the curl bar because right along there it's like it hurts real bad so can't do that and even when I, when I start and I cut down on a lot of the heavy weights, I'm not doing heavy lifting but when I try to do push-ups it hurts.
DOCTOR: In your shoulder or it hurts right here?
PATIENT: It hurts in the shoulders.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well I mean maybe you've got some arthritis in the shoulder or maybe there's something else.  We could probably just; we could try imaging you know we could get some x-rays to see if there's anything going on in there um let me see.  Otherwise so you are 53.  Are you a smoker?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you ever been?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Excellent.  Um did you get your flu shot this year?  Do you want to get it today?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay any reason?
PATIENT: No I'm not taking shots.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Really I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I keep forgetting to bring my medical records here from Rush, that's where I was going when I was in a car accident.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then I was in the hospital for at least three months.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that'd be useful to have here um, let me see, otherwise you're 53.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: What is that?
DOCTOR: They put a camera up your bottom.
PATIENT: Yeah they did that um about two years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll go take a look, [REDACTED]@.  Okay it looks like you need another one next year.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay and they saw the last time DOCTOR referred you to our MOVE Program for some weight loss, did you ever see them?  What do you think?
PATIENT: It was great.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you still going there?
PATIENT: No that was, that was for about a couple of weeks so I finished that program.
DOCTOR: Okay.  They gave some good pointers and things.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I lost a lot of weight.
DOCTOR: Oh good.  How much weight have you lost, let's take a look.
PATIENT: I was 316 when I entered the program, right now I'm 288.
DOCTOR: Awesome.  Okay.  You want to sit up here for me?  Now when you cough and you get this mucous up does it feel better when you get it up?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I been swallowing much better once it comes up.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I think we can give you like a cough syrup or something that'll help break that stuff up.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: A lot of times when people have symptoms like this it's just a viral kind of infection where antibiotics don't really work.  You know viral infections, usually there's a lot of those going around right now, you know the weather the way it is.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Um they usually will last like 10 to 14 days and you kind of just let it run its course I mean it's not anything to treat really.  We can get you some cough syrup and things like that to kind of help with the symptoms.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: There's nothing we can really, you know we don't really need to treat anything so it'll go away on its own.  Um.
PATIENT: I got another question.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I think I know how I caught it.  I have family members that smoke and when I go over to their house it's like damn.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Like I be like, you got kids and all the smoking and the next thing I know…
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My throat gets all scratchy.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's from the smoking.
PATIENT: Yeah cause every time I get sick it’s coming from, the next day I know.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean a lot of people will kind of get like a small bronchitis you know cause smoke irritates your lungs.
PATIENT: It do, it really irritates me so I'm gonna stay from over there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Stick your tongue out for me.  Say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  Yeah that [REDACTED] at home.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] right here it [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Your ear how long has that been going on for?
PATIENT: For a couple of months.
DOCTOR: Couple of months okay.  Did you ever have your hearing checked?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright let me take a listen here.  Just breathe normally.  Okay deep breaths in and out through your mouth.  Okay great let me just listen.  Okay any pain down here anywhere?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay any swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: Just the ankles.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Is that normal for you?
PATIENT: Because the screws and wires down there [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right, right, okay.  Let me take a look at this one here.  Okay now the shoulders, put your arms up like this for me, keep them up, keep them up, keep them up, does that hurt?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay put them out in front of you.  Okay, put them out to the side, up above your head, okay.  So I mean that's, the fact is you've got a pretty good range of motion of the shoulders is a good sign.  I don't think there's any kind of serious injury or anything.  Um I think we could just get some x-rays.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Just to see.  There might be some arthritis or something there um.  It doesn't seem like that bothers you too much with the moving around right?  It looked like you were doing okay with that.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um so maybe we'll do some x-rays and we'll see how those look okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR so I'll be back okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  41:28  DOCTOR IN:  47:17)
DOCTOR: Okay so a couple of things.  So I talked to DOCTOR and we were talking about the shoulders.  We don't think it's anything serious.  I think we could probably go without the x-ray; I want to talk to you about this and see what you think.  So I think that any time you get any kind of x-ray or CT scan you're getting radiation right.  Based on your exam, it's nothing serious.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: And that, at the worst, maybe there's some arthritis but just based on the ability, your strength and your range of motion it's nothing serious.  I think we could go without the x-rays just to spare you the radiation cause you know how it leads to risk down the line.  In terms of the cough, I'm gonna give you something called guaifenesin, kind of like Mucinex; it helps you bring up this gunk.  I don't think we need to, I think it should get better over the next couple of days.  It sounds like it already is getting better.  The smoke, being around the smokers is probably you know, as you've noticed, is probably contributing to it quite a bit.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So I would try to stay out of that as much as you can.  I'll write you a prescription unless do you have the cough syrup at home still?
PATIENT: No I ran out.
DOCTOR: So we'll get you some here.  Do you want to pick it up at the window?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay and then um other than that I mean your labs were last checked just in November so I don't think you need to come back and so, unless something comes up, until November.
PATIENT: Okay when is my next appointment?  My next appointment is in March right?
DOCTOR: Well we got to make it for you but your next one; you have an Endocrinology appointment in March.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: March 1st.  That was the one you follow up for the, you know for the testosterone and things like that.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So that is on March 1st at 10:00 a.m. but to see us I think November is probably okay unless of course something comes up and you need to be seen sooner, we can see you sooner.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright, so just stop by the Pharmacy on the way out and then return back to the clinic in nine months.  There you go.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright have a good day alright.
PATIENT: So give the paperwork to the people out front right?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Perfect.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too.
PATIENT: 49:53
