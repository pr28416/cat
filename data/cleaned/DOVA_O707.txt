DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'm typing it in right now.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And tell me what you've been doing with your diet.
PATIENT: I've been, I've been trying to get those 3 1/2 meals.  I'm trying to get always three in.  Sometimes I can get it in and sometime I can't but I'm going to the gym every day.  I don't know it just don't feeling like the weight wanna come off.  It don't, it's just I don't understand it you know.  And the more I work out, it like it just stays.  You think I got a ulcer or something cause they had to put me.  I had the stomach, one of them showing [REDACTED].  Uh [REDACTED] thing you gave me when they.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound?
PATIENT: Yeah it didn't show no abnormalness [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No are you having stomach pain?
PATIENT: No, I just can't understand why my stomach won't go down you know.  I'm doing sit-ups, I'm riding a bike and I don't know what's wrong with this thing.  I'm thinking I might have Crohn's disease or something.  I ain't got Crohn's disease do I?
DOCTOR: No, that usually makes people not gain weight but they have a lot of diarrhea and constipation.
PATIENT: But do they have big stomachs too?
DOCTOR: Not as much no.  Not the same in that, it all just comes out the other end.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] see if they got that suction and the stomach stapling.  I got to have some help with this thing.  I know what I'm doing maybe it ain't working, it ain't working.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like your pants are fitting loser or you're getting more muscle?
PATIENT: I well I'm getting more, I'm getting stronger, I'm getting stronger but some of my clothes uh getting lose you know.  I can see, sometimes I can lose, I feel like I losing inches you know and then but the weight is still there and like uh two weeks ago I weighed and I was 297.5, now this morning I'm 299, that pound and a half come from less than a week and a half, less than two weeks.  And I want you know, I don't know, I don't know.  It seems like it just, it's hard to take a deep breath of air, it'll turn to pounds.
DOCTOR: I know some people will actually notice their weight will stay about the same or even go up if they start working out because muscle weighs more than fat.
PATIENT: As a matter of fact, I been training at the gym so I know all about that.  My thing is me, why I can't, I'm doing everything I think is possible to get rid of this stomach and it don't seem to be working you know.  I need help, I need, even if I gotta go somewhere else and see if they can do that uh stomach stapling or that liposuction.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I need something like that cause it would take me ten years if I could do it but this ain't working for me.
DOCTOR: Do you have any supplemental insurance on top of what the VA has for you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So if we look for something I'll try to, I'll ask the attending to see if they know if the procedures they do it here if you are eligible.
PATIENT: Right and it got to be a problem because it hinders my health you know.  It's not making me feel any better and uh and messing with my blood pressure, it got to be cause all of this weight and stuff you know so.  Just like you could recommend it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.  But it is interfering.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] ultrasound.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: No fluid [REDACTED] everything was just about the same as the last time it was done.
PATIENT: Yeah I don't know.  [REDACTED].  I don't understand what's going on, what's going on.
DOCTOR: Gotcha.
PATIENT: Uh last week, I [REDACTED] know anything about the gym and how to lifting weight and things.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I was, I squat 505 pounds, three reps.
DOCTOR: 505?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's a lot.
PATIENT: It is a lot but I'm getting stronger but I can't lose this stomach you know.  In that in the gym I lift weights, the cardiac machine, I'm constantly on it and I don't know.  I don't want to do it too much because your stomach would turn into muscle.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know then I'm just stuck with a big old muscle.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah then it'd be out to here and I never would be able to give you a big old, like I got a six month baby stomach muscle but the fact is I can't get rid of it anyway because of the muscle you know.  I don't waht that, I don't know.  It's a dilemma for me.  You know, I don't and I can't and my clothes, I don't like the way I look in my clothes now.  Man, I don't look the same, my stomach.  I like I'm neat, I like to look good but this thing here causes a problem for me and see it ain't shaking my confidence cause I can deal with anything but I just don't like the way I look but I'm not gonna you know.  I don't know it's, it's a hassle.  I'm just, maybe I'm too vain but I don't want this stomach I know that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.  You know I can't predict anything.  I'm working out hard and it's not working.
DOCTOR: Let me take a listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay sure.
DOCTOR: What kind of [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You haven't seen DOCTOR since you saw.
PATIENT: No, did he go to Kentucky with his people?
DOCTOR: He's still here.  I don't, he doesnâ€™t have clinic today here.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: He had an overnighter in the hospital or something.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Deep breath.  But I know that he was just talking about you.

DOCTOR: I'll mention it to him.
PATIENT: Well he had better not forget.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  13:15  DOCTOR IN:  26:02)
PATIENT: I thought you had to deal with a Code Blue.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] where it was.  I think they announced like three different locations.
PATIENT: I thought they said Red Tower.
DOCTOR: They said it was in the Red Tower and then they said the Reception Center and then [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah but then they said something about [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah we have a Code Team that will go.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR:
DOCTOR: to find a prescription pad.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: He'll be in shortly.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: But we need, so I talked to him a little bit about what options that we have and unfortunately we don't have anyone who does liposuction here.
PATIENT: Did you check with Hines?
DOCTOR: Huh?
PATIENT: With Hines?
DOCTOR: I don't know cause we don't have anyone here that works at Hines.
PATIENT: Yeah but I can go to Hines and have it done because if Hines do it.
DOCTOR: If they have it.
PATIENT: Yeah but you gonna check, how you gonna check with Hines see if Hines handles it cause if you don't have doesn't mean Hines don't have it.
DOCTOR: No I mean I don't think the VA has this.
PATIENT: Oh, oh I gotcha.  Okay I see that would probably be some outside thing for me to do, okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And then.
PATIENT: I got you, I understand.  Uh but you say you don't think VA has it so you really don't know.
DOCTOR: No we do have a VA Plastic Surgery section but they do more things like skin flaps or like reconstruction of someone's you know broken their hand and they need to cover the area that's not healing well.  I've never seen anyone there do anything like liposuction.
PATIENT: There's probably a first time for everything.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] you know you never saw you have to ask them and see if, just if they do either.  You got to guess you know you not certain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.  You're not certain of it.  And did you guys decide whether I take my lisinopril?
DOCTOR: Hold on one second, are you still smoking?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: They do have a bariatric surgery that does bypass and banding around the stomach.
PATIENT: Uh yeah actually that's two of them.
DOCTOR: Yeah they won't do, we don't have a plastic surgery that does liposuction but bariatric surgery we do have but you can't be smoking.
PATIENT: Well then when do I got to stop?
DOCTOR: As soon as possible.  Cause they won't even see you.
PATIENT: Okay.  Alright [REDACTED].  This one, this is going to make me stop so I got to, okay let me tell you this, I'm not gonna stop today, but this will be my last week, how's that?
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: This be my last week, after this week the next time you see me I'm not smoking.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now okay, that's my promise.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had any abdominal surgeries before?
PATIENT: No but I've had my stomach, I had open heart surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay.  They are just wondering how complicated it's gonna be.  Because the more surgeries you have the more scar tissue you have.
PATIENT: No, no, no.  I don't know if I have no scar, but I don't go out naked.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm gonna stop smoking, Friday or Saturday is my last day.  How can I prove it that I don't smoke.
DOCTOR: So when you go talk to them you.
PATIENT: Can I go, okay you gonna put in an appointment.
