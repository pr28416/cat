DOCTOR: Really.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You know what [REDACTED] a couple weeks ago I came in, I came into the hospital and I have like a stomach pain or something.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And um this is from someone in Primary Care and DOCTOR, she suggested I get a course of action which I follow and it seems to resolve itself.  She said not to eat anything for 24 hours or a subsequent 24 hour period to be on a liquid diet.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She said to allow my colon and things to kind of relax.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: At any rate that seems to have occurred and then this morning I woke up and I had an explosive case of diarrhea.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: What'd you do?
PATIENT: I bought a brand new stove.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And yesterday was the first time that I actually fried something in it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I fried some chicken.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And chicken fried too quickly and what I did was, I bit into that chicken and when I bit into a few parts, I realized after I saw I looked at the bone and everything, I realized that chicken wasn't done.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It wasn't cooked right.  So what I did with the subsequent pieces that I made and I smothered them.
DOCTOR: Okay.

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It wasn't done.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That can do it can't it?
