DOCTOR: For your heart, a stress test.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: What did they say?
PATIENT: They tried to figure out why I was in.
DOCTOR: Okay.

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] only doing three miles in the morning now.
DOCTOR: What other surgeries have you had?

PATIENT: Yeah I was fine, I had no problems with.
DOCTOR: Good.  You're a diabetic?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: How are your sugars controlled?
PATIENT: Sugar is um with um the medication. I've been keeping my eye on it, keeping better track of them.  I happen to do my sugar this morning it was uh 178.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Is that normal for you?
PATIENT: No usually um I mean I noticed it was usually running like 165.  I had two days where it went kind of high and I remember taking uh, I was taking some cough medicine before I went to bed.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I knew what one was and then the second one I had, I tried to back track and figure out what I had that day, it might have boosted it up why I might have eaten, ate late.
DOCTOR: What do you take for your diabetes?
PATIENT: I got it right here.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]
PATIENT: That's my directions.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So all this stuff you had done over at Jesse Brown you say?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I’ll see if I can find it.
PATIENT: It should be in the system. They've been checking me for a .
DOCTOR: They must have thought that you had something wrong with your heart, if I can find it.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah [REDACTED] the initial hospital I went to is MacNeal.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And um I came to uh Jesse cause I had a primary physician over there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they ran me through the test because uh.
DOCTOR: When was the last time you had an EKG done?
PATIENT: Uh last week.
DOCTOR: Oh okay good then we don't need to do one.
PATIENT: No I had it done upstairs uh and um [REDACTED].  Uh Jesse Brown kinda disappointed me.
DOCTOR: You didn’t like it over there?  They rebuilt the whole hospital; you've been there since it's new?
PATIENT: No I haven't been back over [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm more closer over there.  I'm closer to this one than I am to Jesse for now so, I come here now.  I'm in the suburbs.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Before I was at 138 and Kedzie.
DOCTOR: Okay so you were downtown.
PATIENT: So I was closer to them.
DOCTOR: So you did have one in 2007.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] the reason I stopped going over there and the reason I had my surgery, my prostate surgery was done at Loyola, is because I did the, they did the biopsy and they never called me up to let me know what was going on.
DOCTOR: So you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: So all of a sudden, yeah they left me hanging and suddenly you know, I got a note that I have an appointment.  I come in and uh [REDACTED] surgeon comes up to me and says when do you want your surgery.
DOCTOR: And you're like what?
PATIENT: I'm like you sure you have the right person?  I looked at him like he was oh like he was from Mars or something.  It took a whole month.  “Sure you got the right candidate there, doc?” So uh I went in and talked to a nurse, uh the head nurse at the time and they took me to discuss the stuff [REDACTED] and all of a sudden they wanted me through a whole battery of tests and then uh, I [REDACTED] two-week time frame.
DOCTOR: I'm reading this note from this doctor you saw DOCTOR.  Boy I'm trying to read it from 2007.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Let's see what it says about that stress test.  Your basement flooded.
PATIENT: (Laughter)
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  I can't find the report.

PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: The glyburide.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, Vicodin, metformin, simvastatin okay.
PATIENT: And I.
DOCTOR: Have you.
PATIENT: I don’t take one of them before my surgery so.
DOCTOR: What about this medication metoprolol that expired.  There's like four medications on here that expired.  Did you need to take that one?
PATIENT: Is that from here?
DOCTOR: Yeah this is from recently.  This was renewed by DOCTOR on March 3rd.  It looks like the order just expired.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Were you taking that one?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Let me see what DOCTOR wrote in his last note.  Cause that would be the medication I'd want to get you back on.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I know I got something in the mail the other day.  I got the uh the glyburide.
DOCTOR: And then your other one.
PATIENT: Funny-looking white pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm going to renew the metoprolol and send it to you.

PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then I want to look at your.  And I don't see where is this…  So what are they telling you about your diabetes?
PATIENT: They told me it wasn't under control and I'm like, every time I came in here you're telling me [REDACTED].  I've already had been a full day.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I says you now I, sure I've eaten since then I said but uh I always.  When I was told that I had diabetes and I was told by the nurse to take uh, to check.  All I needed to do was check it once a day.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's all this flip flopping all around and taking the readings.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So the readings were uh flip flopping so they was like well you know you're not really keeping it under control but since um they got on my case about it and my mother got on my case about it I've been doing, I do it every day.
DOCTOR: That's what you need to do good.  Alright do you mind if I take a quick look at you?  I think you're gonna be fine if you get the surgery.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I want to, I'm gonna make sure that you get this medication back before you start so that you can take that before the surgery but otherwise I think you're gonna be just fine.
PATIENT: Okay.
