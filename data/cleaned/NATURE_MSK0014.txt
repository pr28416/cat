DOCTOR: How may I help you?
PATIENT: I just came in here today, I usually don't come to the doctor that much unless I absolutely need it. Five days ago I started having this pain and swelling in my right knee. So and at first I thought it was just like my arthritis acting up but it's been getting more swollen and painful than usual, so I just wanted to come in and check it out.
DOCTOR: OK, so when did you first notice that this pain, like when did it get more swollen and painful than usual?
PATIENT: So like I would say around 5 days ago it started getting more and usually I do get pain in some of my joints but I I don't really get swelling so that was a bit different.
DOCTOR: OK, and is the joint hot as well, or is there a temperature change?
PATIENT: It is, it does feel like if I touch the joint it does feel a bit warmer than the surrounding areas.
DOCTOR: OK, does it look red?
PATIENT: It It definitely it definitely looks more red than my other knee.
DOCTOR: OK, and so what knee is it that, that's bothering you right now?
PATIENT: It's the right knee.
DOCTOR: OK. And so this pain has been going on for the last five days. Has it been getting better, worse, or staying the same?
PATIENT: I think it's getting a. It's getting it was getting worse, but it's like a bit better right now.
DOCTOR: OK.
PATIENT: Yeah it comes and goes in severity though.
DOCTOR: OK, and how would you describe the the pain. The character of it, is it sharp, dull, or achy?
PATIENT: It's it's like someone is stabbing me in the knee and it hurts the most when I'm moving the knee.
DOCTOR: OK, and does the pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Uhm, I don't think so, no.
DOCTOR: OK, so you're feeling it just in the knee and you said moving the knees is painful. Is there anything else that makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Uhm, not really like resting it definitely helps, yeah, but I just have to keep it a bit immobilized.
DOCTOR: OK, and is there anything that that makes the pain better that you've tried like maybe medications or any ice packs or anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh, not really. I do take some painkillers, so just some Advil, which seems to help a little bit.

DOCTOR: OK. And with being at home, are you able to manage the majority of activities of daily living on your own, or are you receiving help?

PATIENT: Probably smoked for more than 30 years and I was smoking only one to two packs a day at most.
DOCTOR: OK. And. OK, and then I about your um family history. Is there anybody in the family that has any heart or lung conditions?
PATIENT: Yeah, so heart disease runs in my family. My brother, my dad, they both both have had heart attacks. But yeah, my on my mom side everyones pretty healthy though.
DOCTOR: Oh OK, that's good, and Alright, so I just wanted to the I guess physical exam piece you've already mentioned that it's red, it's swollen and is warm to touch compared to the other knee and um painful to move. Are you having any limping with your gait?
PATIENT: Yeah, I barely like I can't really put too much away or move that knee around. So yeah, if I stood up I would have a limp.
DOCTOR: OK, uh, and is there any instability to either varus or valgus stress?
PATIENT: Uhm, no, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: OK, and any instability when testing the ACL or PCL with the anterior and posterior kind of translation test. Pulling and pushing it?
PATIENT: Uhm, no.
DOCTOR: OK. And any I don't think I asked this any muscle weakness?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And any numbness, tingling?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Or burning sensations?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: OK. Alright, so that was everything that I wanted to check. Was there any anything that I may be missed or any final questions?
PATIENT: No, yeah no, I was just I I just don't know if like this is serious and if I need surgery or something because it's been really painful.
DOCTOR: Yeah, certainly so right now the top thing on top two things on the differential would be gout or pseudogout they do have some risk factors for that, including a diuretic medication as well as alcohol and obesity are all risk factors for it. However, you also had a knee injection a week ago, which could predispose to an infection. So gout and septic arthritis are the two things that I am thinking about an, so we'll do a knee aspiration and send that off for some investigations and that will help us determine which what the cause is and we can choose the appropriate appropriate treatment.
PATIENT: OK, sounds good.
