DOCTOR: Alright you even got me under [REDACTED] a couple of times.
SECOND PERSON
Yeah that looks okay.
PATIENT: We're doing good.
SECOND PERSON S614
But we were at Dermatology.
DOCTOR: Yeah but I'm working on it.  I know the last time it was very late.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um so.
PATIENT: Yeah we saw you come in late too today.
DOCTOR: Yeah don't tell anybody else.
SECOND PERSON S614
Don't tell anybody else.
PATIENT: I don't squeal.
DOCTOR: Alright so how have both of you been?
PATIENT: Good, still above ground.
DOCTOR: Good, good.  And you saw the dermatologist this morning?
PATIENT: Yeah, she shot me up.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah he [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh you know they froze all that stuff.  That's what they like to do, that's the whole treatment.
PATIENT: She had one of those fire knives, [REDACTED].  I think she treated those [REDACTED] spots on my arms from getting too much sun outside.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON S614
He needs some medications.
DOCTOR: Oh [REDACTED] refills, I've got it right here.
SECOND PERSON S614
Metolazone and magnesium oxide that I know of.
DOCTOR: Looks like niacin, is he taking that?
SECOND PERSON S614
No he's not taking the niacin.
PATIENT: What's that?
SECOND PERSON S614
The niacin that uh uh the doctor, who told us to take the niacin?
PATIENT: I have no idea.
SECOND PERSON S614
Did you tell us to take the niacin?
DOCTOR: I might have, yes, yeah it was me.  You didn't like that?
SECOND PERSON S614
No it's that we talked to the cardiologist and he said uh he didn't think it was necessary, let's just try the fish oil a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON S614
And see how it works.
PATIENT: And the fish oil I still take.
DOCTOR: Oh he does.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
PATIENT: And what's that other pill I'm cutting twice too?
SECOND PERSON S614
The hydralazine.
PATIENT: That's the orange pill.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, it's the hydralazine.  That's for the blood pressure, is that for blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Yep.
SECOND PERSON S614
Uh that's the water pill?
DOCTOR: Not hydralazine um.
SECOND PERSON S614
That's the one he takes, supposed to take three times a day.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON S614
He took that to twice a day cause he was getting dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When did you see the cardiologist?  Was this at an outside cardiologist?
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I mean the niacin is fine.  I’ll defer to the…
SECOND PERSON S614
That's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh your cholesterol is a little bit high.  The higher it is, the more risk that there's gonna be essel disease.  At 83 we don't know if that would be the best you know, we need our goals to be.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh you [REDACTED] what we use is the literature that averages people out.  People that they study are between 40 and 60 usually.  So we don't know if we need to be as aggressive with somebody after they're 80.  I mean the risks of having drug interactions like you've already had with other medicines.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Um goes up so.  How aggressive do we need to be uh but we also don't want to have problems.
PATIENT: I had that other medication and that didn't work.
SECOND PERSON S614
Well that's what he's talking about.
PATIENT: And I experienced that once.
DOCTOR: Hydralazine is a medicine that the way it works is that every eight hours; it's three times a day.
SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.
DOCTOR: If you don't take three times a day, it will be worn off before the next dose so that there's.  I mean I don't want to step on the cardiologist's toes.
SECOND PERSON S614
No, no, he didn't tell, he didn't tell us not to take it.  He just decided not to take it cause he was getting dizzy.
DOCTOR: Like he told you twice instead of three times?
SECOND PERSON S614
No he, he.
PATIENT: He told us three.
DOCTOR: Oh.
SECOND PERSON S614
It's three times a day the way he prescribed it and he didn't have anything to do with it.  We decided that maybe if he took it twice a day he wouldn't feel that uh lightheadedness.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Well I mean, did you bring in your blood pressure cuff though?  Did you have them synchronize it or no?
SECOND PERSON S614
I don't know.
DOCTOR: I mean did you bring it into the clinic today; did you bring it to the nurse?
SECOND PERSON S614
The what?
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON S614
The blood sugars or the?
DOCTOR: Yeah, no the cuff.  Remember how we were having this problem.
SECOND PERSON S614
Oh.
DOCTOR: You're always high.
SECOND PERSON J239
That's right, you told us I just, I forgot.
DOCTOR: It's no big deal cause actually it looks good today.
PATIENT: What did you need from home?
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.  The one that we’re doing at home?  He wanted us to bring our machine to check it with the nurses.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: It’s all right. I mean it's not a huge deal but I know there was that discrepancy.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, it was always high here.
DOCTOR: It was always high here and.
SECOND PERSON S614
It was normal at home.
DOCTOR: Always normal.
SECOND PERSON S614
Now I'll go with normal occasionally.
PATIENT: They have me going on [REDACTED] bring the machine.
DOCTOR: Uh no today your blood pressure looked good.
SECOND PERSON S614
It should, yeah well he was more relaxed today I guess.
DOCTOR: Good, good.  Um okay so otherwise um other than these issues with the hydralazine what.
SECOND PERSON S614
You don't think he should take it twice a day, that's not a good idea?
DOCTOR: Oh, well yeah what I'm saying is if we need to change it to something else we can but I don't think that's the best way to go about it because I mean the reasons that we, the medicines are certain time periods is because that's how they work.  If it was the hydralazine XL, and it was once a day.
SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.
DOCTOR: That would work 24 hours.  That’s why some medicines are once a day, some are three times a day.  Not because the three times a day ones are stronger but because the once a day ones go on slow and off slow, and the three times a day one goes on fast and off fast and if you don't take them three times a day there's a risk that so in the middle of the day your blood pressure is.
SECOND PERSON S614
Gonna go up.
DOCTOR: 200 and.
PATIENT: Well why were my sugars was off?
SECOND PERSON S614
Not your sugars your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Well I'm just saying.
SECOND PERSON S614
Blood pressure.
PATIENT: Sometimes it happens to me.  I put some [REDACTED] stuff in the back of my neck.
DOCTOR: Yeah sugars are a little different.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON S614
What else could be causing him to get lightheaded and dizzy?
DOCTOR: So that's what we have to talk about.  When are you feeling this?
PATIENT: Mostly in the morning.
DOCTOR: And you're saying.  Uh so in the morning you start to feel dizzy and lightheaded.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And is this when you open your eyes in bed or once you get up and get around?
PATIENT: When I get up I start to move.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON S614
Sometimes.
PATIENT: Maybe a little aggressive in the morning, I don’t know, but it catches up with me right away and I gotta go sit down.
SECOND PERSON S614
Is it before you take your medication or after?
PATIENT: Yeah it's before the medicine.
SECOND PERSON S614
Before you take your medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay and this is kind of new?  Starting to be worse, how would you say?
PATIENT: It just seems like certain, certain times.  Sometimes I'll go for maybe weeks nothing and then in one week, two or three days I'm in the morning I get up and by the time I come downstairs and start to move in the kitchen I get lightheaded and I gotta go sit in the chair.  Not for long but.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I can't walk; I can't continue to walk around.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I feel weak.
DOCTOR: And do you feel like it's happening more often now?
PATIENT: Not really, no not really, just certain days I get up and I just can't function.  I want to do something and I say forget about it, I'm not doing it.  I want to do something outside and I say uh uh, forget about it, going back.
DOCTOR: Um and there's nothing that you can tell when it's gonna come on?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: It's uh like before you take your meds, before you have any meals?
PATIENT: Before I have anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you feel like uh do you ever check your blood sugar at that time?
PATIENT: I check it in the morning.  Some days it's 140, some days it's higher.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But if it's low I'm shaky, I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh do you notice that the blood sugar is associated with this feeling of dizziness at all?  Is it higher when you feel dizzy?
PATIENT: No, no [REDACTED] no.
DOCTOR: It's kind of independent of that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um.  Okay.
SECOND PERSON S614
I thought it might be the blood pressure, not the blood sugar.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly, that's the other thing uh.  When you say dizzy I know we said lightheaded already but do you feel like the room's spinning around you?  Or do you feel more like you're about to pass out?
PATIENT: I'm just weak.
DOCTOR: Weak.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: I feel like, I'm afraid to do anything [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON S614
He's not steady on his feet.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Any chest pain or palpitations?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Uh okay and you never had any episodes of actually passing out recently?
PATIENT: No.  Probably a year or so ago.
SECOND PERSON S614
When you passed out? That was three years ago. But that was a sugar related thing yeah.  That was not.  Could the blood pressure medication have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Yeah that's what I was trying to look at it.  It could be a couple different things.  It might, I know you feel bad and it's a bad feeling but it might be because of the medication but not necessarily a bad side effect of the medication.  Um one of the medications, the one you take at night the atenolol.
SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Have you always taken that at night?
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  That may be one that we might want to switch you to the morning [REDACTED] because that medication, the atenolol it will work.  How it works is it prevents the heart from beating too fast and what, the good thing about that is that uh that way your heart, your blood pressure doesn't go up because your heart doesn’t push the really fast and pump the blood pressure way up.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh that's kind of one of the ways that that medicine works in multiple ways that we don't necessarily even understand but that's one of the ways it does that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The problem is that if you want to do anything and exert yourself what the physiological, what the body does is it increases your heart rate so that your brain can get that, so your muscles can get all the blood, so your body wants the blood pressure up a little bit um.  If we give you this medication that doesn't allow your heart to speed up fast sometimes if you move around really quickly your body can't adjust to that.  Your heart can't adjust to that really fast so it makes you feel a little dizzy or lightheaded.
SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And it can be to the point where you fall down.  That's when we say [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I personally think it's just that I get up and I'm doing much too fast.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'm [REDACTED] and I'm not going anywhere.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And when that happens I just find a chair and then I go sit down.
DOCTOR: And another of the, on top of that, just um as we get older, we get into our 38s.  Um.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] huh.
DOCTOR: The vessels because less compliant before when you're young the vessels can open and close a little bit more and you can variations in how we move around and stuff can be, that can help with that and as we get older the vessels don't do that as much.
PATIENT: They don’t function.
DOCTOR: Yeah they don't function fast enough so that they can't adjust when you get up really fast or you do a lot all at once.  Um I would say to start with um your heart rhythm looks fine so I don't think we're giving you too much of the atenolol.
SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um if it was down in the 50s or something I'd say we'll back off on that and see how you do um what I would say to start out is basically kind of lifestyle modification stuff.  Get up slower um, especially in the morning.  A lot of people will actually get out of bed and go jump in the shower.  Kind of slow movements, get up, sit down on the side of the bed for a second and then stand up.  Um don't do it all at once, the same with anything, just sitting on the couch.  Uh be careful about standing up really fast or getting up to go to the door.
PATIENT: Sudden moves, yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah um because that can also precipitate kind of this feeling of weakness.
PATIENT: That’s possible that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I get up and I come down, because we’re [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah then the next step, I would say, if you're still feeling bad about that would be to switch this medication to the morning instead of late at night because what happens is you take this at night time and your heart rate goes down anyway at night.
SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you also have this medication that's on, it's a 24 hour medication so it's working all day but um theoretically it can be a little stronger, it can be like the peak of it will be right in the morning.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: So that maybe what's happening is that your heart rate's already slow from just, from sleeping, you're body's response and then on top of that you have a medication that slows it down a little bit more.
PATIENT: Yeah more.
DOCTOR: And then when you get up you're having symptoms so, it's not bad that it's on at night and we have lots of people on it at night and in the morning, it doesn't matter as long as you take it the same time of day.  So if you wanted to move that one to the morning and move one of the other blood pressure medicines to nighttime, which I'd recommend the fosinopril that you have to nighttime.
SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um just so you have, I mean you're taking the same amount of medications.
PATIENT: Different times.
DOCTOR: But we might prevent this a little bit more and see if it doesn't help.
SECOND PERSON S614
But keep the hydralazine at three times a day?
DOCTOR: I would.  I would unless you notice at home the blood pressure is below 90 on the top number.
SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.
DOCTOR: Which that would be.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, it's never been there no.
DOCTOR: Um cause that's when you start really seeing symptoms.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah well it's never been there.
DOCTOR: Being less than 100 or less than 90 uh that's when we [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON S614
No his blood pressure's usually about 145/67 and I don't know, is 145 is not too high for the age or?
DOCTOR: So again a lot of these things, we look at all these younger people and say, when they're blood pressure is under 140 or even under 130 they do better in the long run.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Ten, twenty years down the line.
SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um for you I don't know if we have to be that aggressive.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Especially if you're having other symptoms.  If we get aggressive about the blood pressure and you fall and hit your head, we didn't do you any favors you know.
SECOND PERSON S614
That's uh right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So um I would say we can slowly work on it but um I'm not going to simply go in and throw you on a bunch of new medications.
PATIENT: Medications.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause I got enough changes in [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON S614
No it's just.
DOCTOR: And.
SECOND PERSON S614
What he's on now seems to be working fine.
DOCTOR: Good.
SECOND PERSON S614
Except that this lightheadedness.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON S614
I didn't know but your suggestion sounds good.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON S614
To switch those medications.
DOCTOR: If the blood pressure's starting to go up that's when we really want to do something.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But um, if it's staying the same or even improving like it was today it was better than it did the last time.
SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I would keep what we're doing on and not worry so much that.
PATIENT: Just slow down.
DOCTOR: In the 140s.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah just slow down.
SECOND PERSON S614
Don't try to move.  Don't try to move too fast.
DOCTOR: Um the metolazone that you're on, I couldn't find it for some reason, you just take them on Tuesdays and Thursdays right?
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  You get all of these in the mail?
SECOND PERSON S614
Yes we do.
PATIENT: She's been doing [REDACTED] prescriptions.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I think we just called in last week.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, there were no more prescriptions.
PATIENT: Right, which ones, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Otherwise doing pretty good?
SECOND PERSON S614
He's got a scratch on his leg.  I don't know if his leg is infected or.
DOCTOR: What'd the dermatologist say?
SECOND PERSON S614
He didn't look at it.
DOCTOR: He didn't look at it.
SECOND PERSON S614
No.
DOCTOR: When did this happen?
SECOND PERSON S614
About I think last week.
PATIENT: Last week.
SECOND PERSON S614
Wednesday.
DOCTOR: So did you just scratch that.  Did you fall, you didn't fall?
PATIENT: Uh  bench on a deck.
SECOND PERSON S614
And we've been treating it with uh flushing it with saline water and putting an antibiotic on it.
DOCTOR: Just like a triple antibiotic?
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, triple antibiotic but then I noticed it started to get red but it's not feverish.
DOCTOR: No.  Have you.
SECOND PERSON S614
Just like.
DOCTOR: Is it painful?
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON S614
It's like cellulitis.
PATIENT: But as soon as I touch something I, I know I get an infection.
SECOND PERSON S614
He's prone to infection.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because of my sugars.
DOCTOR: Yeah um, if the sugars are up then infections are more likely but.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Your sugars haven't been that bad.  The other thing is with having, you've had diabetes for a while now right?
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: With diabetes you get um, [REDACTED] um you get diseases in our arteries and veins and stuff and so what happens is that if there's not good blood flow there then none of the things that cause us to fight off infection are there.  That's not painful when I press?
PATIENT: Just a little bit, not much.  It's gotten better.  But there was.
DOCTOR: Did you have it there too?
PATIENT: Yeah it was up there too.
DOCTOR: I don't think it's infected but uh do you wear, do you have compression stockings or anything like that?
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON S614
He has them but he doesn't wear them.  We wrapped his leg up sometimes.
DOCTOR: It's not, it's not infected but um it's just kind of what we call hyperemic around there because it's gotten angry and because it's uh.
SECOND PERSON S614
It's gotten mad at us.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.
SECOND PERSON S614
When he hit uh, when he hit the bench he was mad.
DOCTOR: You were mad?
SECOND PERSON S614
He was mad.  He was angry then.
PATIENT: When I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right, yes.  Let me listen to you.  Deep breaths in and out.  Just breathe normal.  Well it might help in the short term to get, to make sure that that blood keeps flowing through that area and it doesn't just stay there um to help.  If you notice this getting any more swollen or the redness starting rather than staying the same or getting better, if it starts to spread, especially going up that's when we start thinking about infections.  Let's just say you're more prone to infection so keep doing what you're doing.  Keep the um.
PATIENT: Antibiotic.
DOCTOR: Antibiotic.  Usually what I say is you can keep it open during the day if you need to get it some air or whatever but at night put it on and cover it.
PATIENT: Well I'm just putting cotton gauze.
DOCTOR: No that's fine.
PATIENT: I don't put any medication.
DOCTOR: Oh I mean that's all fine too.  To be honest with you the triple antibiotic thing we do it because we think it helps but there's never been any research that's proven that it helps.
SECOND PERSON S614
Well you know the thing is when it was oozing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON S614
It was, it uh prevented from sticking to the gauze.
DOCTOR: The medicine was good for that.
SECOND PERSON S614
So that's why I used it.  Now it's drying up quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON S614
But then the redness started to and I see one of his ankles started to get all red, I said this is something.
DOCTOR: Yeah so.
SECOND PERSON S614
But it's not hot, it's not feverish.
DOCTOR: Right.  Those are all like if it's starts becoming more painful, if it starts to get swollen.  If the redness you think is getting worse, progressing, uh then you can either come in to Urgent Care Clinic or you can give the clinic a call and um they can call me and I'll call you back either send you something out.
SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.
DOCTOR: Or do something.  I mean it's not; it's not going to need anything right now.
SECOND PERSON S614
It doesn't need an antibiotic?
DOCTOR: Not just yet cause it's not gonna help.
PATIENT: Could you send me that stuff like to wash?
SECOND PERSON S614
The saline, we can get that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'm not sure.
SECOND PERSON S614
Saline water.
DOCTOR: Just water.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah the saline.
DOCTOR: I can see if I can put it in.
SECOND PERSON S614
Saline solution.
PATIENT: Is that paper?
DOCTOR: Oh you're allergic to the tape.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah he's allergic to that tape.
DOCTOR: Is silk okay?
SECOND PERSON S614
Yep.  He's allergic that tape.  That would cause us big problems.
DOCTOR: Then it would get more red.
SECOND PERSON S614
Then it would get more red.
PATIENT: When I had my appendix, the appendix healed and I was all covered with blisters and they found out it was the tape so now whenever anything happens, I say, paper only.
DOCTOR: Uh the other thing it looks like were you gonna see the GI doctors?
SECOND PERSON S614
Well he was supposed to in May but we never got an appointment.
PATIENT: I went you to put in a prescription.  They told me last week, to re-examine my hearing you have to put in my prescription.
DOCTOR: Yeah Audiology so just so they redo the hearing test?
PATIENT: Yes cause she's thinking that I might be due for new hearing aids.
DOCTOR: What do you think, are you just ignoring her?
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON S614
Maybe it ain't the hearing.
PATIENT: No, no, no.
SECOND PERSON S614
But she, she, when we went there last year, late last year, she said you're not due till July of 2010 and you have to make an appointment through our primary doctor.
PATIENT: And I think you better put in the.
DOCTOR: And you've seen, you saw them last year yeah before.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON S614
For Audiology.
DOCTOR: GI.
SECOND PERSON S614
GI they never called us.
DOCTOR: Yeah and that's weird.  We'll schedule an appointment today, no problem.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um let me make sure and when did you see them last?
PATIENT: I think a year ago.
SECOND PERSON S614
GI?  In 08.
DOCTOR: 08.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
PATIENT: Been two years.
DOCTOR: Okay and if it's been over two years they want us to put in a new consult but … May ‘08.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah I think it was May 5th when we.
DOCTOR: So I'll just put in another one just so they know why.  There's a certain way to do things around here.  [REDACTED].  Um anything else that you guys need for sure?
SECOND PERSON S614
No that's it.  Let’s just see the medications that are.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll make sure your meds are all refilled before.
SECOND PERSON S614
Oh I don't think he needs any blood work.  He's had it not too long ago.  I think the last time he was here he had blood work done.
PATIENT: The only medications that bother me is the one that put me in the hospital.
SECOND PERSON S614
But you're not on it any more.
PATIENT: Fish oil is working fine, take the fish oil twice a day.
SECOND PERSON S614
But we don't know what it's doing to your cholesterol.
DOCTOR: Yeah I will make sure [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON S614
So would it be helpful if we constricted that leg a little bit, like put a band on it?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]  Sometimes what happens when the blood slows down in the leg it sometimes puts a force.
SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Any time there’s infection, not infection, inflammation, it can make it, we want everything to keep moving.
SECOND PERSON S614
To keep yeah.
DOCTOR: In that area.
SECOND PERSON S614
So keeping his leg up.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, yeah, those are all good things um.  Let me see here.
SECOND PERSON S614
It's not too swollen.
PATIENT: Why are my legs this color though?  What causes that?  I mean it's uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's usually um the veins in there that aren't, that aren't working as good as they once did.
PATIENT: They're not pumping.
DOCTOR: Um and it's just what we call venous insufficiency.  The veins aren't, the veins all have little valves in them so that when you pump the blood up here and when it comes to the top it hits the valve and it pumps it keeps, them, and it's just that over time, especially if somebody's had diabetes or some sort of leg insult those valves don't work as good and they're not like.
PATIENT: They're not.
DOCTOR: They're not like heart valves.
PATIENT: The motor's not right.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.
SECOND PERSON S614
In the legs.
DOCTOR: It tends to stay down in the leg and that's when you get the swelling a little bit and then also it can become discolored a little bit.  That's why you also lost hair down there, not as hairy as you once were.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] hairy legs.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: I need hair up here too. The arms.
DOCTOR: Um around February we checked everything so probably what I would say is next time when you come in, before you come to the clinic, just stop by the Lab and we'll check your cholesterol again, it'll be about six months then.
SECOND PERSON S614
That would be uh fasting?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.  They'll want you to fast.
DOCTOR: That's true so it might be, anytime you’re in for a morning appointment.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah for sure.
DOCTOR: Stop by the Lab.
PATIENT: If I get up in the morning and try to get my car to drive or something without anything in my system, forget it.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I'm gonna have something, even if it.
SECOND PERSON S614
We might.
PATIENT: Just a slice of toast.
SECOND PERSON S614
When we go to the cardiologist, perhaps we could have that cholesterol checked through him which is easier for us to do early in the morning.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Yeah that's fine if you bring it in as long as we have a record of it.  Um.
PATIENT: Something.
DOCTOR: That's not a big problem yeah I don't think there's anything else that we need to check.  Alright, anything I didn't talk about that you need me to go over?  Let me talk with my supervising doctor a few moments and we can get this show on the road.
SECOND PERSON S614
Anything else?
DOCTOR: Do you see an eye doctor or foot doctor?  Oh it looks like you saw the foot doctor in December.
SECOND PERSON S614
Foot doctor we see outside of the clinic and actually the eye doctor was recent but we're going to stop going here too.  We're gonna start going outside.
DOCTOR: Okay.  That’s find, as long as anything that I mean.
SECOND PERSON S614
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: If you're telling me that is fine, I'm going to take your word for it but remember we're going to document what you say.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: And we have to say that [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Those are just things we just have to check every year so, so that we get reimbursed or the clinic gets reimbursed.
SECOND PERSON S614
Right and we understand.
DOCTOR: Um, alright.  I'll be right back.
SECOND PERSON S614
Alright, thank you.
(DOCTOR OUT:  74:04  DOCTOR IN:  80:34)
DOCTOR: Alright it looks good.  One, the only thing that she was saying is that if you continue to have these symptoms, even after switching these medications around from the nighttime to the daytime.  Uh we may want to recheck an echo, that's the ultrasound of the heart just to make sure there's nothing new going on with the heart and it's causing you to feel this.  Generally it wouldn't be something that would only happen during the mornings if it were the heart but it'd be something that you'd notice throughout the day.  Um but that's like the next kind of step [REDACTED] we okay.
SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um any other questions, concerns?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Everything seems to be okay, I'm still above ground.
DOCTOR: You're still above.
SECOND PERSON S614
So I just uh, give me some directions, I'll write down what we're supposed to do.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so what I would do.
SECOND PERSON S614
Change the.
DOCTOR: Just change as little as possible by switching.
SECOND PERSON S614
So write here.
DOCTOR: Yeah so um atenolol which is [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON S614
To the a.m.
DOCTOR: To the a.m. and.
PATIENT: Is that the green one?
SECOND PERSON S614
No it's the little white one you take at night.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: And uh.
SECOND PERSON S614
Take that in the.
PATIENT: Oh it looks like the water pill.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, we're gonna put that in the morning with the water pill.  Then the half a pill.
DOCTOR: Right.
SECOND PERSON S614
You're gonna take at night.
PATIENT: The one you break?
SECOND PERSON S614
The one we break in half.
PATIENT: That goes at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah we're switching those around.
DOCTOR: Well yeah you'll still get good blood pressure control throughout the day.
SECOND PERSON S614
And then you take the orange pill three times a day again.
DOCTOR: Yeah no I would do that just until.  If you notice low blood pressures then we can change that around.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: And I'm thinking over the next couple visits, probably the next visit, we'll talk about switching the.  How much is that dose again.
SECOND PERSON S614
Hydralazine?  I think it's 10.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON S614
Is it 10mg?
DOCTOR: So maybe the next time, I mean I don't want to switch everything all at once.
SECOND PERSON S614
No.
DOCTOR: Cause it gets confusing.  So maybe the next time we can talk about taking that off and going up on some of the other stuff cause there's room to go on the fosinopril the half a tab.
SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We can always go to a full tab.  So we can do that next time.
SECOND PERSON S614
Sometimes he gets little tremors, little shaky but I don't know if that has anything to do with any of the medications that he's taking it might just be his demeanor at the time you know he gets a little angry and just.
PATIENT: Like yesterday.
SECOND PERSON S614
He gets shaky.
DOCTOR: Uh yeah I don't know.  You're on a lot of different medications.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: But you know that um. You’re on a lot of medications, you know that.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]
PATIENT: First things [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right, so let me know if that gets worse and we can start looking into stuff and we can start taking stuff off and putting stuff back on.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And the goals of all this, I mean are obviously to get you on as few of pills as possible.  It's gonna take a little bit of time.  It's a lot easier to throw a bunch of pills.
SECOND PERSON S614
Oh sure.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON S614
Sure.
DOCTOR: Than take them off okay.
SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright so we'll see you back in like three to four months again and make sure that this has gotten better.
PATIENT: Make it four months.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON S614

DOCTOR: So take that up to the clerk at the front up here.
SECOND PERSON S614
