DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yeah right here, excuse me.  How you doing?
DOCTOR: Uh good.  How are you?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Uh we're on the first door on the right, the first one that's open on the right.
PATIENT: Okay.  That'd be this one here.
DOCTOR: We've met before right?
PATIENT: Yeah uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Sorry I see a lot of people.  How are you doing today?
PATIENT: How you doing today.
DOCTOR: It's good to see you.
PATIENT: Yeah you too.
DOCTOR: My computer's just loading up here.
PATIENT: Okay.  That's fine.  This is as fast as I've ever been waited on for an appointment here.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah I try to be quick.  Sometimes you know, sometimes I spend too much time with patients I get behind you know trying to make sure everyone can get done, get everything done with them.
PATIENT: No I understand.  I know you're busy.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: You know so I most of the time I blame it on the, these were the for the last time we were talking about saying I was trying to get my plates and stickers and you told me to bring it back when I came.  I got this one here when I was on the 7th floor.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay and I was wanting to see.
DOCTOR: Let's see what we've got here.
PATIENT: Yeah and then I got to get me some more copies of my DD214 and I got to get more copies of.
DOCTOR: Okay this is for a parking sticker?
PATIENT: Parking sticker and the plates.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's the same thing.
DOCTOR: Okay and it's all.
PATIENT: All three of those right.
DOCTOR: Alright so I got to see, I got to fill that out?  Anything else today that's bothering you?
PATIENT: Uh you know I need to get to I guess Vascular.  I think I showed you. Right there is a big chip out of my the elbow, right there.
DOCTOR: Yeah can you take this off and we'll take a look at it?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I got this when I was in PCF Camp in Fort Leavenworth, Missouri the same year I was discharged; it's a chip, big chip so.
DOCTOR: Okay.  This little nodule right here?
PATIENT: Yeah, where that little piece of bone is missing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And eventually it came to the surface on the skin and I couldn't even put my arms down, nor drive.
DOCTOR: Where is it right now?
PATIENT: Well I took it out.
DOCTOR: You took it out?
PATIENT: Yeah I cut it, sliced my skin and took it out.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But arthritis has set in there too and I was telling them two MRIs when I had at [REDACTED] out in Calumet City.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then they took one here from my rotator cuff by my first doctor and he said it's totally destroyed and I can't lift my arm unless I do it like this – that high and then that's as high as it'll go and my arm continuously aches and pains so I guess arthritis is setting into it, there's no more cartilage period and it’s a real pain right in this part right here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh I don't know.
DOCTOR: As far as the elbow goes, I guess what are your expectations on what we can accomplish?
PATIENT: I really don't know.  We might not be able to do anything but I do want to put a claim in for this because I didn't do that at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I put in a claim against my rotator cuff because all this happened at the same time.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause I was jumping [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And both of them happened while you were in the service?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause they picked me up over the head and you know like being PCF [REDACTED] is all gravel.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So they picked me up and it was like five or six guys it's reported everything and they slammed me down the side of my face and my arm was up under me.
DOCTOR: Okay when they [REDACTED] you.
PATIENT: Yeah so then messed up my leg too.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah cause I fell down on this.
DOCTOR: I don't know if they're gonna be able to fix, if it's like arthritic pain or arthritis I don't know how much or what they'd be able to do.  Um.
PATIENT: I don't know, see like there, that piece [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Does it hurt you to move it?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Back and forth.
PATIENT: Yeah it pops.
DOCTOR: It pops.
PATIENT: It's not popping right now yeah, yeah.  It pops and then sometimes you know like on a bad day it'll just ache so bad when I'm in the bed you know I have to.
DOCTOR: Did you see someone before for that like the orthopedic doctor or?
PATIENT: No I just saw my regular MD, DOCTOR; he's at the Family Medical on 115th.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I been seeing him.
DOCTOR: What did he say about it?
PATIENT: He said that I need a replacement you know for my rotator cuff.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And as far as this he said.
DOCTOR: Do you have MRIs that have been done here at this facility?
PATIENT: Yeah they had one here.  I mean they just stopped even, you know my vascular appointment is one day next month.
DOCTOR: I don't think that's going to be a vascular problem though you know.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: I don't think the Vascular Clinic.
PATIENT: Well what kind of doctor you think this might look at that to see what they can do?
DOCTOR: Um well probably orthopedics.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If they think that they're going to do a total shoulder replacement.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um that could be the orthopedic people that would take a look and if you have a MRI here I think that they would appreciate kind of taking a look at it and then kind of evaluating you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Whether they're gonna do something about the elbow I don't know about that.  I mean you seem to have fairly good function of it but uh.
PATIENT: You know sometimes it stiffens up but mostly.
DOCTOR: Sometimes I mean they could take another MRI of it and maybe if they want to go and do some like arthroscopic cartilage removal, sometimes they'll do that.  They may even do that on the shoulder.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: Well I'm pretty sure they're gonna want to take a MRI but I put the claim in anyway so.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you've already put in a claim for that?
PATIENT: No I haven't already.  In fact I was waiting to see what they were gonna come up with.  I had, they had to show me, I think they did give me a copy of the MRI but I don't have a DVD player so I got caught in the flood.  I think we talked about that last time.  It destroyed my whole apartment, bed, clothes, you name it, it's gone.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I want to log in here.  How's everything else going though?
PATIENT: Oh I need to go see my foot doctor, the pediatricians, not pediatricians.
DOCTOR: Podiatry people?
PATIENT: Yes because I was late, when I went up to the 7th floor on the Psych Ward I missed all of my appointments so they rescheduled me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh.
DOCTOR: Do you need another, to see the podiatry people again?
PATIENT: Yes I do.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What's wrong with your feet again, can you remind me?
PATIENT: Yeah I got a blister on the first toe next to the big toe and its right in between my feet so it constantly stays there.  They can only scrape it down; I don't know how come they can't remove the core.
DOCTOR: Okay but it's not a nail care thing?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They don't have to do anything with [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No, I need to get my nails done.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That they digging down into my foot and it's making it very difficult to walk.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So do the Nail Care Clinic and then hopefully within the next two weeks we can get you another appointment.  Let me look real quick maybe they already have one and I won't have to do anything.
PATIENT: They may have.
DOCTOR: It just takes me a while to kind of log in here and then I can see.
PATIENT: Okay.  Let's see is there anybody else I need to see oh, they gave me, you gave me some drops for my ears and somehow or another it disappeared.  I think what it was, is my girlfriend was staying with me; she left because the house got messed up so that's good.  Didn't have her around when the chips were down I don't need her around when things get better you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So if you could order me some more ear drops that would be.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, yeah, I can um cause was it the itching is that what it was?  What was wrong with the ears?
PATIENT: Yeah I kept thinking that the uh.  You know we talked about the swabs last time.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah I remember.  I told you.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] right.
DOCTOR: How were the drops working for you?
PATIENT: They were working pretty good.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah and I got dry eyes.  I might have those cause of my glasses.  Now I've already got my glasses, I just got to take them back to the guy, to the doctor to get them fitted.
DOCTOR: How long have you been walking with the cane?
PATIENT: Oh almost three years now.
DOCTOR: Okay and just to remind me, why do you walk with a cane?
PATIENT: Because I have a bad hip and knees.  My knees have arthritis in it so bad.
DOCTOR: That's right.
PATIENT: With that going on and then you know that foot swole up most of the time you know because of my blood pressure.  My blood pressure keeps, this morning I woke up and both of my hands look like boxers.
DOCTOR: Yeah, actually your blood pressure was actually pretty good today.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Did they tell you what it was?  It was 134/81.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what the nurse was telling me.
DOCTOR: That's pretty good.  You're taking your medications [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah what I did was I, what I did was I took a half of one, half an extra one because I heard news about one of my older gentleman friends that passed Sunday and I got kind of emotional outside and I could feel my heart pumping you know so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then like I say my hands was swollen up so bad this morning that I took that extra one to try to rush it down.  I've got.
DOCTOR: Can I get you up here so I can take a look at that shoulder and that elbow?  Let me see if I can uh.
PATIENT: You want the shirt off?
DOCTOR: Now I have to put it in the log.  Um yeah so then we can get a good look at the shoulder.
PATIENT: Okay.  Yeah these legs, that PAD.  I need to get back in that program.  They sent me a letter but like I say my wife went through the house like a tornado and she threw away what she was my fiancée but she threw a whole bunch of my paperwork away getting pissed off you know so I need to find out if I'm still eligible to come, go over there to Feinberg and just sign up.  I need to come here to try to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah I don't see actually, I don't see an MRI was done.
PATIENT: Well, they did one, I don't know if they just didn't write it up cause like I told you [REDACTED] discontinued treating me for my arm and my leg.  I was going to the podiatrist so I know it was back there, I guess at GU, is that upstairs?
DOCTOR: Uh GU is the genitourinary people.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Kind of like the kidney and the.
PATIENT: Okay, well this is for my legs on the second floor.
DOCTOR: Second floor.  It could have been um, could have been vascular but.
PATIENT: Vascular that's right.
DOCTOR: But it could have been, so they decided not to treat you anymore because it wasn't a vascular problem is that what you're saying?
PATIENT: Yeah just that they suggested it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Then they had then this PD, PAD Program all the time.  See they got with the VA in order for me to go to Northwestern and if I, so not this but one day this week I'm gonna get over there to Northwestern.
DOCTOR: Yeah cause they actually did a MRA rather.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: An MRI and it shows like angiography too but everything was actually pretty normal.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Your blood flow is actually pretty good to your feet.
PATIENT: Yeah but that's not what they said on paper.  They said they need to send me a paper from Northwestern cause you can look [REDACTED] my legs swell so bad I can't move.
DOCTOR: But.
PATIENT: But see all this here.
DOCTOR: Swelling isn't necessarily.
PATIENT: This a broken vein you know.
DOCTOR: A problem from lack of blood flow either.  Can you take off your shoes too cause then we can.
PATIENT: And as far as I can tell, they already knew that I got the vessels and I have to get something from Northwestern cause that's a bunch of bull.  That's a bunch of bullshit.  I know I had it cause they gots paperwork from them saying that I had PAD.  So.
DOCTOR: Let me see what they put in the notes.
PATIENT: I'm thinking cause that ain't what they said to me.  [REDACTED].  I had to put this on my toe, see that, callus or whatever it is.  I think I have black socks and my gym shoes on, you'll have to excuse my feet.  Sweating like hell. [REDACTED]@  Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let's look.
PATIENT: Do you need me to take my slack off or not?
DOCTOR: Uh that's fine I should be able to feel your pulse.  I just want to make sure that you have good pulses in your feet and I'm going to try to see the Vascular Notes here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And see what they said.
PATIENT: Cause they were going to operate on my knee, put the stents in and they changed they mind the same day I came in for the operation.  Interns upstairs [REDACTED] interns, that guy talking to me just like he’s my doctor and he’s just learning how to do this, stop talking to me like a kid.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So you're gonna see the Northwestern people now?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: I'm just try to catch up on the Vascular Notes from them.
PATIENT: Yeah that'd be more than likely in Northwestern.  I bet you that I carried around and monitored everything for six months from Northwestern you now.  I got the paperwork somewhere but I'm gonna get a copy of my records from Northwestern so [REDACTED].  Just take a look at my feet, you can tell there's no circulation down in my feet.  [REDACTED] crazy.
DOCTOR: Can you feeling me touching in here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good.  Feeling me here?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Now is this what they, they worked on you?
PATIENT: It happened at combat boot camp service.
DOCTOR: Can you feel me touching you here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Can you feel me touching you there?  Okay.  Going all the way up?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: All the way up okay good.
PATIENT: See them things that's all of them messed up back here [REDACTED] and behind my kneecaps too.
DOCTOR: Okay nice deep breath good.  Nice deep breath, good.  Alright your right shoulder is the one that bothers you?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay let's try something.  So can you take it and go all the way up with it here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Kind of pops on you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have to stop.
DOCTOR: Can you go all the way up with it?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Does that hurt?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay where does it hurt?
PATIENT: This right joint from the inside all the way to the outside.
DOCTOR: Can you put it on down?  Have you ever separated it in the past?
PATIENT: You know, but again this was separated when they threw me down back in ’75.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that's what [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah and its hurts [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.  Feel like pulling in my neck.
DOCTOR: I'm trying to see if there's any like laxity in the joint, let's see.  Can you turn this way, can you make a curl?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay now curl up like this.  Where does it hurt to do that?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] shoulder blade, not in the blade, but in the joint [REDACTED] my joints are really messed up.
DOCTOR: Can you go all the way with it though, even if you go through the pain?  Okay.  Okay and back okay.  Can you rotate your arm like this?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] painful in the rest of my shoulders.
DOCTOR: Okay now let's try this one.  Can you come out like this?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well if I take this, if I send you to the orthopedic people.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think that they are going to want some type of imaging.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Of your shoulder.
PATIENT: Okay well I been [REDACTED] too with that.
DOCTOR: Cause I don't doubt that you had it done before.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But if it's not in the computer then here it doesn't really exist, you know what I mean?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So they want to see some good imaging before, before they see you.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Um and then they can kind of review the imaging and kind of see what they're dealing with and they say by looking at the imaging and they say no this isn't amendable to surgery or not, maybe we can actually do something that would be beneficial.
PATIENT: I understand.
DOCTOR: You know, so I don't know what they would actually kind of think.
PATIENT: Well, you know, when my first doctor told me it was like the end of 2005 and he was suggesting then you know [REDACTED] that I have emergency surgery on it.  But then it was in the winter time too so I don't know, that's what they gave me an MRI.  They looked at mine and said they couldn't read it.  I don't understand how come they couldn't read it.  It came from [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh it came from yeah.  So I see a couple MRIs that were done but they're different ones.  They're of the belly and the pelvis.
PATIENT: I had all of that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um and I don't see any.
PATIENT: It would be at the beginning of my medical report I guess because that's when I got it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: See that's when I came here.
DOCTOR: And this goes back to 2009.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: But actually it goes back all the way but it doesn't have any history of you before then.
PATIENT: I don't know why, see that's all messed up.  Everything should be in there.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So let me go discuss this with DOCTOR okay.  Do you have any other questions; oh I'll run this form and the parking thing by her too okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think this is just my suggestion but I want to kind of have her back me on it um.
PATIENT: Well [REDACTED] cause we don't get along that's why I come here and changed doctors because she told me if it was up to her I wouldn’t even be here.
DOCTOR: So I mean I think an MRI is probably reasonable if we want the orthopedic people.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But let me discuss it with her first okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll be back.
PATIENT: Alright.  That's it; [REDACTED] talk to her.
DOCTOR: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  26:35  DOCTOR IN:  34:30)
DOCTOR: Hi, hi.  [REDACTED]
PATIENT: How you doing?
DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR.  How you doing?
PATIENT: Yeah pleased to meet you.
DOCTOR: Okay so the two things, is [REDACTED] shoulder up here?
PATIENT: It's real tight.
DOCTOR: You had, this was an old injury.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then what was the plan for it?  Can you raise [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: No I can't, I been through all of that I'm not going to one more thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, [REDACTED].  So what was the plan I mean what we can do is, you get this plain imaging, which does not help a lot because the only thing we sure of there's not any else going on and then we can refer you to Ortho.  The question is if they offer you surgery are you interested in the surgery or not?
PATIENT: Yes cause my shoulder was supposed to be replaced five years ago.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You know the doctors changed their mind I done this on my leg.
DOCTOR: Whose doctor?
PATIENT: The doctors here yeah.
DOCTOR: Orthopedics surgeons?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: These were the guys, no they wasn't Ortho, was that Ortho with the knees?
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: I think he was seeing Vascular Surgery and they were going to possibly put in a stent.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Like the AVIs were like 0.65, they were kind of just like moderate and that's why they did the MRA.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  So that’s not unreasonable because the reason is I talk to the [REDACTED] patient.  Sometimes the flow you're getting through this your own blood vessels is more than flow you're going to get through the stent.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So they the stent was not superior to what already you had.  That's why they won't do the surgery.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then [REDACTED] go then and do.  So that’s what we're going to do, referral to Ortho, get the plain imaging and then they’re most likely they’re going to order the MRI for you and there you go.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: The other thing is you wanted the handicapped parking; you do not meet the qualification of handicapped parking.  This cane at this level doesn't count because people they use that [REDACTED] forever.  They said you're able to walk 100 feet.
PATIENT: Who says that?
DOCTOR: The State Department.  100 feet, and a 100 feet is from there to there, from here and to that's from the beginning of this door to the end of the Ward and you perfectly can do that.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm not going to sign it.
PATIENT: That's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, whoever has to sign it.
PATIENT: Yeah that's why [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Are we finished so I can go cause I was [REDACTED] I have someplace to get.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay thanks DOCTOR.  So we're going to start with like x-rays of your shoulder and elbow.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: And they'll just call you for that.  I'll order that and then I'll reorder the eye drops okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: She talking about I don't need this plate.  See she's stuck on that bullshit.  I can't stand.
DOCTOR: And the ear drops.
PATIENT: I am pissed.
DOCTOR: So then hopefully the orthopedic people will call you but we're just going to establish some x-rays okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I need to get out of here man cause I feel my blood pressure going up now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I am sick of that broad.  Just check me out so I can get my transportation and get the hell away from here.  [REDACTED].  I asked them not to even, to take her off of my case period.  I don't want no, don’t bring her in on nothing [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'd ask you to give this to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh and I got a call.  Can I change clinics then, because I don't want to have anything to do with her period.
DOCTOR: You can uh; you can ask if you'd like to change clinics, you're able to do that.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what I want to do.
DOCTOR: You want to do that?
PATIENT: Yeah, hang on to that cause I despise the bitch.  Did you sign me out already?
DOCTOR: Watch your mouth okay.  No swearing.
PATIENT: Come on then, I want to get away from you too.
DOCTOR: Now, we’re going this way.
PATIENT: Whole damn clinic.
PATIENT: 38:41.
