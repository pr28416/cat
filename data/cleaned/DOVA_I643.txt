PATIENT: Right okay.
DOCTOR: And take the ranitidine right before you go to bed every night.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Irregardless of whether or not you feel the reflux cause sometimes you don't feel the reflux pain but you actually do have reflux so.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: It may be the reason you have nausea in the morning, who knows.
PATIENT: Oh okay right, okay.
DOCTOR: We'll see if that works.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um if you, you know if you keep having symptoms and the reflux doesn't get better there's always a surgical option.  I don't know if anyone's talked to you about that or maybe you just didn't want it or anything cause you've got that hernia.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Cause you do have the reflux because of the hernia.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Some people have reflux just because they do and we don't know why.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You actually have a reason to have reflux.
PATIENT: Right okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll try that.  Try scheduling it at night, the ranitidine.  Take it at night even if you don't think you do.
PATIENT: Even okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then um.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then we'll see how it goes and we can follow up with the stomach doctors, the GI doctors.
PATIENT: Right okay.
DOCTOR: In a couple months.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Then you can let them know how you're doing and.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause they would be the ones who say you know you should do the surgery, now they won't do the surgery.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But they can make a suggestion as to whether you need it.
PATIENT: Okay right.
