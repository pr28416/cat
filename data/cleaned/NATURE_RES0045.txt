PATIENT: Uh no travel, all the meetings have been in the city.
DOCTOR: OK, OK good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own or anything that you wanted to discuss today that I missed?
PATIENT: Um no, that, I was just worried about uh Covid.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so that's definitely top on the list right now for things that we have to rule you out for. Um so we'll take a swab today, we'll send it off um for those PCR results, you should hear back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods. Uh but if your symptoms get worse, like you're running a really high fever, um you're having neurological symptoms like you know seizures or fainting spells, um or if you're having difficulty breathing, um you should come back to the ER. So how does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's really informative. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, take care.
PATIENT: Thank you.
