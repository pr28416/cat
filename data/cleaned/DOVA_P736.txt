DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Oh how you doing DOCTOR?
DOCTOR: Good, how you doing?
PATIENT: Very good.
DOCTOR: Do you have pain?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Are you having pain?
PATIENT: Yes I am in my back, back and both of my hips.
DOCTOR: It really hurts you huh.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Come in here and sit wherever you're comfortable.  I don't know if I've ever seen you before.  This may be the first time I've seen you.
PATIENT: Yeah this is the first time.
DOCTOR: Do you want me to take your coat sir?  If the seat with the back is more comfortable you're welcome sit right here, otherwise [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm gonna sit here.
DOCTOR: Yeah, no that's fine.  Alright let me just pull up your chart here.  The doctor that was on this computer before locked it and now I have to restart it, so I've been [REDACTED] you today.  Okay.  While that catches up with us, how long has it been this bad?
PATIENT: Well it's been hurting for a while you know.
DOCTOR: How long?
PATIENT: The doctor that's been coming out to see me, you know, she has been giving me some pain pills, but she don't want to continue to just giving me pain pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She wants me to you know get it checked out.  She wanted me to go to a pain doctor.
DOCTOR: Specialist?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Who is seeing you, is it a visiting doctor, at home?
PATIENT: Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.  DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Through the VA here or somewhere else?
PATIENT: No she's a mobile, mobile uh.
DOCTOR: Mobile doctor?
PATIENT: Mobile uh-huh.
DOCTOR: What was she giving you for the pain do you know?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Was it Vicodin?
PATIENT: Vicodin, Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  That's the reason.  Usually we like to give people Vicodin to try and get them over a hump.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: People who have chronic back pain like that.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: You're always gonna be in some degree of pain but I'm sure as you know if it's bad.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: If it's bad enough you'll get something done.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: So some people have pain all the time?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Your body gets used to that.
PATIENT: Yeah well you know it helped, but you know but you know but she doesn't want to continue to give it to me cause she say that you know it would probably start affecting my liver and then you know it will be habit-forming too also.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: You know so she didn't want to continue to give it to me you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So she wanted me to go to a pain doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay and really um, I'm not a pain doctor.  I'm a general internist, which means, but I can get you to the pain doctor and I can try my best to get you on, you know, something else.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: It might help cause I don’t have more experience with pain that she does.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um are you taking any other medications?
PATIENT: Uh no.  My high blood pressure, that's the only thing.
DOCTOR: Do you know what that's called?
PATIENT: Uh, I don't remember the name of it.
DOCTOR: Is this the first time you've been here, with us?
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: Is this the first time you've been here to the VA?
PATIENT: No, I was here um, I don't know about six weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'll check to see if it's [REDACTED] then I can look and we can see all your meds.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And your vitals and how your blood pressure has been and all that kind of stuff.  Um you said it's in the hip as well?
PATIENT: Yeah they I mean it radiates.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's in my back and then it radiates down to my hip.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then it goes all the way down to my knees.
DOCTOR: Does it ever reach the back of the foot?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Does it ever reach the back of the foot?
PATIENT: No uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay, it stops at the knees.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um any incontinence?  Are you losing your bowel or your bladder with this?
PATIENT: Am I?
DOCTOR: Losing your bowel or your bladder.  Are you being incontinent with this pain?  I know this sounds like a strange question but the same nerves that supply down the back of the leg also supply your bladder and your bowels.  So if people are having a lot of compression on that nerve for some reason or the other.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Sometimes they're not able to hold their bowels or bladder.  Has that been a problem for you?
PATIENT: No, no, no, no.
DOCTOR: Good.  Any tingling on the inner thighs at all or just pain down the back?
PATIENT: Uh it's just goes; it goes in the thighs and then the back of the knees.  If feels like its radiating.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, I'm sure it does.  I mean it sounds to me just um like textbook sciatica.
PATIENT: I thought it was you know like, see at one time I was carrying my wallet in my back, in the back pocket you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh somebody told me that that's probably what's, you know, what's causing the pain you know.
DOCTOR: Uh I don't know about that.
PATIENT: But I haven't been carrying a wallet back there for a while; I keep my wallet in the coat pocket.
DOCTOR: Yeah but you're probably still getting the pain huh?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let me pull this up.  I'm sorry for the delay.  I'm gonna pull up the internet too and I'm gonna show you something um, cause has anybody ever done an MRI of the back or explain to you why you get the pain in the hip as well?  Has anybody ever talked to you about that aside from the wallet theory?
PATIENT: No they took x-rays you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But uh.  They asked me if I had fallen or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I denied it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know I don't remember myself falling.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When did you first start having back trouble?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Even as a young man?
PATIENT: I'd say about, about two years.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: About two years ago and then I, I had a therapist come over and he used to give me uh exercise you know cause I have in all the years of walking being bent over like this you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh he would give me exercise and then after the exercise it would do okay.
DOCTOR: Probably feel good.
PATIENT: Yeah it helped.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know but then after a while you know I got it going back again.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Let me call this nurse back if you could [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Alright.
(Doctor makes a phone call)
DOCTOR: Man they keep us, so I'm, most the doctors here we all work at either University of Illinois or Northwestern.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And they keep us, so I was at work last night till about 10 p.m. and admitted 28 patients yesterday.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So it's just gonna be, you know it’s one thing after another.
PATIENT: Yesterday they were telling me to go to the uh.
DOCTOR: U of I?
PATIENT: Uh-huh and uh I just happened to be passing here and I was you know [REDACTED] a bit, I just asked if any of the pain clinics you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Here you know and they told me yeah so this is where I stopped you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah, nothing wrong with that, especially if you're a veteran, use your benefits.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They're all gonna be free.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And if you’re not getting your medication here, um you know right now we should definitely start because I'm sure it's gonna be, I mean depending on what your co-pay is and stuff.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: It's usually a lot cheaper than getting it on the outside.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  So what they did it looks like that they gave you some x-rays.  They x-rayed the back, spine and x-rayed the right hip and then the right femur, which is this bone here.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you actually had [REDACTED] you saw DOCTOR, the one I was just telling the nurse to go page, who's covering for me over there.  Um.  So did you get x-rays the last time you were here?
PATIENT: No I didn't get the x-rays here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know, the day the VA told me to go and get them I was hurting so bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And she told me that I had trouble walking down here to Radiology and then going over there to the uh.
DOCTOR: Lab and all this stuff.
PATIENT: Lab and stuff you know and man I was hurting so bad that day I just kept on out the door you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, I understand.
PATIENT: I wanted to keep my appointment today you know I, yeah I wanted to go and got to keep my appointment.  I had lost my appointment slip.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: I didn't know what time I was supposed to you know be here.  I was here early this morning.
DOCTOR: Yeah I saw that, 10:44.
PATIENT: Yeah, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So let me take a listen and then I want to show you this picture.  Um so what the physical therapist was probably doing that helps is a lot of times strengthening those muscles are on the back groups helps you take some of the pressure off for the spine.  Your spine is like Legos, like blocks.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And if you get trouble in that with the little nerves coming out.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You tent to get pain like you're having.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um so the physical therapy is good because it strengthens all the muscles around that and keeps those vertebrae from [REDACTED] and putting pressure on.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um, let me see if I can take a listen to you.  Do you have heart problems?
PATIENT: Do I have what?
DOCTOR: Heart troubles?
PATIENT: Heart troubles?
DOCTOR: Have you ever had a heart attack or?
PATIENT: Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Mouth open, deep breath in and out.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Okay.  Can you show me with one hand where it hurts the most?  Right on the side there huh?
PATIENT: Right in here.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Did you ever wear a brace when you were a kid?  Did they ever put you in a back brace when you were a child or anything like that?
PATIENT: No um.  I know, I [REDACTED] when I was 5-year-olds I got run over by an automobile, you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I wore a cast.  I was in a cast from here all the way down to you know.
DOCTOR: Oh wow.
PATIENT: And both my legs so.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: Cause on the exam your spine is a little crooked.  It almost looks like a little scoliosis but not only are bent like this, you’re bent a little bit this way.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's typical.  Scoliosis usually we think of the spine going like this but in reality  it can [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah okay.  It's a little bit different in there.
DOCTOR: Yeah I think having scoliosis and having an injury in the past.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Makes you more likely to have this so, scoot your butt back for me, I just want to test your reflexes here of your foot, alright.  And just relax.  Do me a favor and take your hands and go like this, perfect.  Okay.  So the pain is on the side.  I don't want you to have pain, of course, but I'm glad it's not on the bone.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay I'm gonna lay you back.  You can go real slow.  Just lay back.  Does that make the pain any better, any worse?  Can you relax for me [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I get stiff but it doesn't make me feel pain or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I'm gonna lift your lift your leg up here.  I want you to tell me if it causes you any pain and if so where, alright.  We'll go real slow.  Tell me if it's hurting you.  Tell me when okay.  You alright?
PATIENT: Okay it's starting to hurt now.
DOCTOR: Where does it hurt?
PATIENT: Right there.
DOCTOR: Right there alright.  Okay the same here.  Does it cause any pain when I pick this one up?
PATIENT: Yeah this ones bad.
DOCTOR: It hurts you on that side huh.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Let me sit you up here.  Alright.  Is there anything that seems to make the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Does anything seem to make the pain better or worse position wise?
PATIENT: A position?
DOCTOR: Yeah, like leaning forward, leaning back, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well sitting down you know helps the pain.  When I stand and when I walk, when I walk is when it really, you know it really hurt most.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that's when I have the most pain is when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know.  As long as I'm still.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But when I cramp, you know like I be on the bus sometimes and like if the bus is crowded or something.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I have to scoot a certain way.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because then you know.
DOCTOR: It takes some of the pressure off huh.
PATIENT: Yes, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, excuse me. (Doctor speaks to someone at the door)  Let me show you this picture.  So I think what's going on um, pretty classic for something we call sciatica.  I just put in three x-ray of the back.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But I think I already know what I'm gonna find.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Probably gonna see.  Can you see right here, I know it's kind of, let's see if I can make this any bigger, okay so that's much better.  So what I, said, oh alright so your pain you were telling me is kind of right here.  We're looking at the back of this gentleman right.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: The pain is kind of right here.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So but these T's and these L's stand for are how medicine named the blocks that make up your lumbar spine.  What the picture is trying to show are all the nerves that come out in between those blocks.  The pictures of blocks here and a block there.  So from things like injuries like you got hit when you were five.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: One thing, scoliosis is another thing.  Those are two things that tend to give people arthritis in the back okay and what happens when they get the arthritis, so picture these kind of two blocks here, there's a close-up picture and he and you live your life in your 30s you just came out no problem and you have no pain.  So these nerves travel everywhere, some down your legs, up your arms wherever and ever nerve is responsible for a different part of the body okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So the reason why I was asking you does your pain go past your knee, does the pain reach your feet at sometimes is to figure out exactly what nerve might be responsible for causing you this pain.  So as we age you get these little bony spurs here and these little bony spurs pinch those nerves.  So the fact that you're getting pain here and the pain goes all the way down to your knees but doesn't get past the leg.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Tells me your trouble is probably in the nerve L3-L4, actually probably most definitely in L3-L4.  So what I bet we're gonna find in your x-rays, we're gonna find some bony spurs compressing those nerves.  So what do we do to treat it is the big question.  There's a component of inflammation.  So you're always gonna have those spurs, you can't get rid of them, despite surgery, despite anything.  So we got to get in the place where we're treating your pain on a daily basis.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And whenever you get these inflammations you get exacerbations you know you throw out your back or sit for too long whatever, you're gonna have these ups and downs of pain.  At that point, I'm definitely comfortable to give you Vicodin.  At that point I'm definitely comfortable giving you Flexeril which is actually a muscle relaxant.  That's what DOCTOR gave you before.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Did that help you at all?  The Flexeril?
PATIENT: Um I had some before.  They helped you know at night you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: They uh you know when I go to bed you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They helped but during the day they don't they don't do a thing.
DOCTOR: They don't do it okay.  Alright um the other thing of course is I want to see your x-rays even though I'm pretty sure I'm gonna see those bony spurs compressing the nerves.  I want to see if there’s anything else going on.  You've never had cancer?  Right you haven't.
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Alright very good.  Um so maybe let's start there.  [REDACTED].  But I think that’s a good way to do it and I like to show my patients just so they understand what's going on.  You know if I explain to you what's going on then we can work together to get you feeling better you know.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um let's see here.  Okay just let me enter this.  So I'll just kind of go through what DOCTOR said.  You have a history of hypertension, the scoliosis and the lumbago, that's the back pain.  You've had ulcers in the stomach and then what it says, its kind like you've had um some blockages in the heart.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But like you told me, no heart attacks or heart troubles.  Surgeries you had the removed parts of the ulcer.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um you're taking the Vicodin and then the blood pressure medications.  Are you still smoking?
PATIENT: Uh I smoke about four or five cigarettes a day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think that's better of course than a pack you know but smoking and pain are related.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm, I'm weaning myself off the cigarettes.
DOCTOR: Okay have you ever had a colonoscopy?  This has nothing to do with your back.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You did.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay was it normal?
PATIENT: Uh yes.
DOCTOR: And when did you have that?
PATIENT: Just before I had the ulcer.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because you know I thought because of when I had that colonoscopy they took a piece.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Of my skin, they pulled a piece of my skin.
DOCTOR: A biopsy yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.  And I was assuming that that was what caused the ulcer.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: After they you know stuck that you know probe up in there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And started taking stuff you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I thought maybe that caused me to have ulcers because I never did have any pain.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: In my stomach before you know.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: It was never any pain.  I never had no kind of uh indication that I had a ulcer you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then you know and I went to the hospital they told me that I had a hole in my stomach you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They were telling me there was a ulcer you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's what I found out.
DOCTOR: That there was a hole.  Any stomach pain since?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: No I never had any.
DOCTOR: So no blood in the stool or dark tarry stools?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  So when did you have the operation to take the?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: 10 years ago, 5 years ago?
PATIENT: No, about five years ago.
DOCTOR: About five years.  Are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: So in terms of today what exactly do you think I could do for you today.  Are you bad enough where you think you need Vicodin?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Are you bad enough where you think you need some Vicodin?
PATIENT: I don't, usually can I get the Norco, they said Norco is good.
DOCTOR: Norco is just like two Vicodins.
PATIENT: Yeah but they said it don't, it don't do what Vicodin do.
DOCTOR: Now do you have liver troubles?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Do you have hepatitis or liver cancer?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: No hepatitis?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So you haven't really [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You can take as much as 4 grams of Tylenol a day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That’s quite a bit of Tylenol right.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And a Vicodin was 325 mg.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So in theory you could take probably about 12 Vicodin before you start having liver trouble.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: A lot of nurses don't understand that, they think all Vicodin and Tylenol is bad for your liver. It’s not.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Um in terms of the Norco they [REDACTED] don't let us have Norco here cause it's a stronger narcotic.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I prefer to keep you on Vicodin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But, again, if you’re getting them from me I'm gonna talk to my attending DOCTOR and see what she thinks about a pain consult.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um at this point.  But the fact that you've only had this for two years I like the fact that you did some physical therapy.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: I like the fact that you're still moving around.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: I don't think there's anything wrong with your hip.  I don't think there's anything wrong with the back of your leg.  I think it's all coming from the back.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But I want to get those x-rays with DOCTOR and just do some regular labs to make sure there's nothing else awry.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um any questions for me or anything I didn't ask you that you think might be important?
PATIENT: The only thing, the nurse when she come out to the house she felt a knot, do you think it's a muscle or something that's here?
DOCTOR: Yeah I think you were probably having a muscle spasm secondary to this arthritis.
PATIENT: Cause right up there, right in where you had.
DOCTOR: Where I'm pressing?
PATIENT: No up a little bit, up a little bit.
DOCTOR: Right here?
PATIENT: Right in there, right in there.  She said it was swollen or something.  She felt a bulge or something.
DOCTOR: I think it's, yeah there is a little bulge but I don't know if it's due to the misalignment of the spine.
PATIENT: Could it be a muscle or something?
DOCTOR: I don't know.  It's hard to say, does it hurt when I press on it?
PATIENT: No it doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: I think it's more just because your spine is misaligned but let's get that x-ray and see if we see anything.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um alright, anything else?  Any other questions or anything else bothering you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay let me just take a listen.
PATIENT: I can't hear.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you ever worn hearing aids?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: But I think I need them.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is it both ears?  One ear?
PATIENT: I believe it's both ears.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you ever get ringing in the ear?
PATIENT: Do I get what?
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright yeah I can definitely set you up with hearing tests.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: You know there's different kinds.  Sometimes there's a problem getting the sound from here to there and sometimes [REDACTED] so we can do that.  Any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Well I know I need glasses cause I know, you know I know I now I used to wear glasses you know what I'm saying in school.  I had to have glasses in order to read.
DOCTOR: You wore [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Keep up with class and.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Other than that and uh I used to drive a lot you know and I didn't use glasses for that, only at night you know and to see the signs.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If I'm in a place that I'm not familiar with I have to know where I'm at, I read the signs.
DOCTOR: Okay, I get it, I know this, I know you're here for your back I understand that but if it's all the same to you I have no problem referring you to Ophtho to get glasses or to Audiology to get your hearing tested.  Any headaches?
PATIENT: No, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Changes um, any nausea, vomiting?
PATIENT: Uh, uh.
DOCTOR: Okay you told me no abdominal pain, no bleeding from below.  Are you moving your bowels okay?
PATIENT: Uh my bowels I move, I don't move them every day you know like I know I should do.
DOCTOR: No you shouldn't, everybody's different.  As long as you feel okay and it works for you. It’s fine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you ever do feel plugged up sometimes it's just as simple as staying real hydrated.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Taking a walk.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Yeah see that's my problem.  See I like to walk you know but I, I mean I can't walk the distance.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know and I mean I walk from here to the machines out there you know and I be about to fall over you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So it's hard for me to you know take a walk.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm sure it is.
PATIENT: Other than that I feel pretty good.
DOCTOR: Feel pretty good.  Any trouble passing water?
PATIENT: I pass too much water.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How old are you?
PATIENT: Uh 72.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um you know when you watch a baseball game how they have all those commercials about dribbling, hesitancy, frequent urinations all that stuff?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Does that sound like you?
PATIENT: Yes uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Any man gets old enough his prostate gets old with him, it gets bigger.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And it chokes off the urethra which connects the bladder to the outside.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: How many times a night are you getting up to pee?
PATIENT: Oh man about at least six times.
DOCTOR: Oh my goodness.
PATIENT: At least six.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So this is the kind of thing that's completely up to you because there's really no harm in not treating it and I'm not trying to push a bunch of junk down your throat since this is the first time I meet you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But they do make medicine for that.
PATIENT: Yeah but a guy told me he said you ought to be glad that you go to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Because he stopped going and he was on dialysis.
DOCTOR: That’s different.
PATIENT: And so.
DOCTOR: That's trouble with the kidneys.  You keep your blood pressure low you'll never have trouble with the kidneys.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure was great today.  A little high but I can live with it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah so um let me know, let me know if you want that and we can do that for you, that's really easy to take care of.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Any problems aside from the back and the pain?  Any other problems with your joints?  Your hands look like, yeah this really makes me wonder so, did you ever injure the hands?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: You've got significant arthritis in these hands.
PATIENT: Arthritis, that's what this is.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah significant.  So sometimes, so the fact that you have trouble here, usually it means it's just kind of wear and tear arthritis, over use arthritis.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Sometimes more women than men we see a lot of swollen knee joints, it's just sometimes [REDACTED] upright [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah but I know I got arthritis.
DOCTOR: Yeah but this is, I can tell you've had it for years because this is permanent enlargement, this isn't active arthritis per say.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But the swelling and there's been a lot of damage for years.  Okay.  Do you take anything besides the Vicodin at home?  Do you ever try Tylenol or tramadol or anything else?
PATIENT: Tramadol they gave me, they gave me tramadol but tramadol really don't [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Do much?
PATIENT: Help the pain you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I don't know maybe you know but I don't have no pain nowhere else you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Nowhere else.  I don't even have it in my hand.  I have it in my shoulder sometimes you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Other than that I don't you know.  My biggest problem is the back area and my hips.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Alright.
PATIENT: I'm gonna be just fine.
DOCTOR: Well I'll give you some um, I think it's important to take scheduled Tylenol, I really do.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So taking it kind of every eight hours.  Cause pain is the kind of thing if you don't stay ahead of it it will catch up to you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know so especially with a lot of these veterans who are trying to be tough you know, they say oh I can take the pain when I can take the pain meds and they wait until it gets so bad and then they really have to play catch up.
