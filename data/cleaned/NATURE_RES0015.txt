DOCTOR: What brings you in today?
PATIENT: So I've been having just a worsening breathlessness. I've been also having a cough, and I think I might have also had a fever in the last couple weeks.
DOCTOR: OK, um so the breathlessness started six weeks ago, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: OK and then when did the cough start?
PATIENT: I'd say around the same time the breathlessness started, so around six weeks.
DOCTOR: OK. And then the fever?
PATIENT: The fever I've kind of had on and off in the last couple weeks. I would say two to three weeks.
DOCTOR: OK, OK um and do you, how often are you having this breathlessness?
PATIENT: Um I would say it's pretty much there most of the time. It sometimes gets worse when I'm exerting myself, but I think just baseline, I feel like I've been able to breathe less heavily than before.
DOCTOR: OK, so alright, and how long does it last when you do get it? Or is it just always there?
PATIENT: Uh, it's kind of just there, but then when it's getting worse like it lasts a couple minutes to, I would say like 10 to 15 minutes and then it goes back to like just the normal breathlessness.
DOCTOR: OK, and if you were to describe the quality of your breathlessness, would you say that it feels like a kind of like a burning feeling, like you're having a hard time catching your breath or does it feel like you're breathing too fast?
PATIENT: I think it's more I just can't seem to take like deep breaths. And then when I get breathless, I I really try to take a deep breath but I just can't find myself catching my breath at that time. So it's just more not being able to catch my breath.
DOCTOR: OK, sure. And are there things that make make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Uh, not really, I think it's sometimes moving around too much, but like nothing, nothing really causes it.
DOCTOR: OK, um, and was there any sort of trigger six weeks ago that you think may have like caused all of your symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh I'm not sure I I don't think there was any triggers.
DOCTOR: OK, has anyone around you been sick?
PATIENT: So there there are some people living in my house that have a bad cough over the last few weeks.
DOCTOR: OK.
PATIENT: So yeah.
DOCTOR: So they have similar symptoms to you as well then?

DOCTOR: OK. OK, um alright. If you were to rate your breathlessness from one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your breathlessness?

PATIENT: No, this is like the first time I'm having this issue.

DOCTOR: OK, OK. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Not currently, no.
DOCTOR: No, OK. Have you ever had unprotected sex?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No?, OK. OK, um, did you have any questions or concerns? Anything you wanted to discuss that I hadn't asked you about?
PATIENT: Um, so yeah, this is just like my first time visiting a doctor in this country and like I was just very scared that it might be something serious, so just wanted to know what it can be.
DOCTOR: Yeah, for sure. So the first thing we want to rule out is TB. Because you have recently moved to Canada from a country where it is, I believe it is endemic, so and some of your most of your symptoms fit with TB and how it presents so we just want to make sure it's not that because it is highly infectious and and we don't want it to spread. So, we can do like a AFB smear or I think they have other diagnostic work up for that too. So we'll do that first. If not, we can check to see if it's like another, another typical pneumonia, we can do a chest X Ray for that as well. If both of those turn out to be negatives, then we'll have to work you up further for other things, like COPD, or lung cancer. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good. Thank you.
