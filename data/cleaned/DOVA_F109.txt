DOCTOR: PATIENT?  Hi sir you can take a seat over here.
PATIENT: Okay.  How are you today?
DOCTOR: Good, good.  Sorry I think got scheduled to the wrong clinic today.
PATIENT: Whoa oh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] on Thursday.
PATIENT: Yeah I usually come in on Thursdays.
DOCTOR: Yeah so that's what was going on today.  They mis-scheduled a bunch of people.  Um I went through your chart and it looks like you were supposed to have your cholesterol and your labs done but you haven't had them done.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um why didn't you go up to get your labs done?
PATIENT: Nobody ever told me to go and get them done.
DOCTOR: Um back in July when they saw you they asked you to come back in two days and get your labs done.
PATIENT: I got them done back in July.
DOCTOR: Okay cause I looked at them and I didn't see any.  I think I'll just check one more time.
PATIENT: Last time I was here yeah.
DOCTOR: I saw the last one in June but not from July yeah.  So they weren't done since June.
PATIENT: Okay then that was, they only told me to go one time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay so [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You're just here for a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: A follow-up plus I'm having some problems.
DOCTOR: Okay what's your problems?
PATIENT: Okay uh my I've got a toe on my, I guess I need to be referred to Podiatry.  I've got a toe on my right foot that if I don't work on it at least every three or four days I can barely walk.
DOCTOR: Does it hurt?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Is it ingrown?
PATIENT: No it's the nail when it starts to grow out.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Take a seat up here and let me take a look at you.
PATIENT: Ever since '79 in the snow.  I was out in the snow and the nail turned black and it never.
DOCTOR: Okay which toe is it?
PATIENT: It's next to the baby toe.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I don't know what toe that is.
DOCTOR: Let me look.
PATIENT: But that's why of course back in June I told them that it felt like had pulled a muscle in my elbow or something.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it was hard for me to lift but I had an elastic band on my elbow.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And now if I don't put a band around my elbow I can't lift any more than about four or five pounds and it feels like the tendon is about to tear from the bone or something.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure looks good.  Okay let me see.
PATIENT: This toe.  There's a big callus here and when this nail grows out I can barely walk.
DOCTOR: It hurts?
PATIENT: It does when it grows out if I don't work on it like every two or three days it's unbearable.  And then I've got a question.  I've been working for, I guess, about the last month removing mold and painting a basement.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And the past week I've been really out of breath and my chest has been hurting.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I guess from the fumes whatever.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Is there anything I could put like in a.
DOCTOR: So you're being [REDACTED] basement?
PATIENT: Yeah well they had water damage so I tore out all the mold and redid this stuff and I've been painting and cleaning and stuff and I guess the fumes just might, like I say for about the last week my chest has been hurting and I been out of breath so I thought maybe if there's something I could put on the inhaler or something that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay so does your chest pain only occur while you're getting short of breath?  How does it happen?
PATIENT: No I can, I mean I get short of breath now, some like just now bending over uh.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And this is so back in June I was getting out of breath and if I go to exercise or do sit-ups or stuff I get dizzy.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay I thought that was the blood work was to find out if something was wrong there but now it's uh like I'll go to sleep at night and all of a sudden I start having real bad chest pains.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or I'll get up and.
DOCTOR: How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: This is, the chest pain for about a week now.
DOCTOR: A week okay and how long have you been working in the basement for?
PATIENT: Uh about a month, month and a half.
DOCTOR: And I saw that you were using cocaine.  Have you used any recently?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When was your last use?
PATIENT: Uh probably June or July.
DOCTOR: June to July okay.
PATIENT: About that time.
DOCTOR: Cause you with cocaine usage it can actually cause heart attacks.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: But this doesn't feel like a heart attack, it's almost like somebody punched me in the chest.  It's like; it feels like I'm having pain in my lungs.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know I thought maybe if I got an inhaler and maybe put some Vicks on there or something.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That I can inhaler could.
DOCTOR: Uh does the pain occur while you're sleeping?
PATIENT: Sometimes it's while sleeping, sometimes I walk to the store and all of a sudden my chest will start hurting.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How long does it last for?
PATIENT: Uh maybe oh half hour, hour.
DOCTOR: Half hour and you have problems breathing while that happens?
PATIENT: Yeah I get short of breath but you know sometimes I can.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Cough and some white stuff will come out you know and then it feels better.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I thought maybe I'd inhaled too much paint or too much of the chemicals I was using to get off the.
DOCTOR: Does anything make it better, the pain?
PATIENT: Uh fresh air.
DOCTOR: Fresh air okay and then does anything uh make it worse?
PATIENT: When I get too hot, you know the apartment's too hot.
DOCTOR: Does exercising make it worse or better?
PATIENT: I haven't been able to exercise cause I go to exercise and I get, I'm getting so dizzy.
DOCTOR: So [REDACTED] pains you stop walking or do you keep walking?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah I stop.
DOCTOR: Does the pain get better if you stop walking?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: And can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It's as if somebody just took their fist and punched me in the chest and it's just real sore and it hurts you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and any nausea or sweating or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yeah I get nauseous.
DOCTOR: Did you have a stress test in the past?
PATIENT: I had a stress test I think back in June or July or something.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Was that normal?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh okay good. Just going to check.
PATIENT: Excuse me.
DOCTOR: Oh that's okay.  How long have you been working on this basement for?
PATIENT: About a month, month and a half.
DOCTOR: Does if feel like the breathing is worse when you're working on it?
PATIENT: It I mean, you know I'm finishing up now but like I say the past week, it started about a week ago and then it started getting real bad and then I started wearing masks and I turned on a fan and opened all the windows so it's not as bad as it had gotten you know.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like your chest pain is associated with your problems breathing?
PATIENT: I think so.  You know what it kind of reminds me of once years ago uh back in the '70s when I was young I bought a building and I was trying to clean it up.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I made the mistake I didn't know, I mixed some alcohol and some bleach together, I mean uh some ammonia and some bleach.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I was cleaning with it and the fumes, I inhaled them and my chest started hurting and started [REDACTED] and that's the type pain I feel you know when I have these little episodes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's why I was thinking maybe it was coming from me inhaling too many chemicals.
DOCTOR: Hold on one second.  (Doctor makes a phone call to check on the patient's stress test not in the computer).  Okay.  No thoughts of hurting yourself or hurting others?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: No thoughts of hurting yourself?
PATIENT: Oh no, no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You're taking aspirin every day?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Why not?
PATIENT: Uh because I wasn't told to take aspirin every day.
DOCTOR: You weren't?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay. (Doctor talking to person regarding echo report on phone)
Okay so good.  So the good news is your stress test was negative.  So I'm not too concerned that this is your heart.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then can I have you sit up here while I type.  I want to take a listen to your lungs and heart okay.  Take a deep breath.  Keep your feet here.  Okay great.  Okay.  And about your elbow what did you mention first about your elbow?
PATIENT: Right through here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's like the muscle or something like that when I lift.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It feels like it's coming lose.  I can't lift anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I got it real tight in that one space and I wrap it and I can't even lift a five pound bag of [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it's been like this since I guess about May or June.
DOCTOR: Squeeze my fingers for me.  Squeeze as tight as you can.  Good.  Make two fists; go like this, good stop.  Now go like this.  Okay good.  You've got really good strength in your arm.  I'm not sure why you're not able to lift things.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because I mean when I'm testing right now, you're really strong compared to other people that I know.  So it may be it's just you feel like you're a little bit weaker but you feel really strong.  I'm not sure what the problem is.
PATIENT: Yeah but when I, let’s say if I grab [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Does it lock?
PATIENT: No if I go to lift something like this, in fact this pops out like that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then I have to drop it.  It's something right through here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Cause you have really good strength when I'm pushing down on your arm, I think having stronger muscles [REDACTED] now right.  I wouldn't be too concerned about it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now should I go to the Lab when I leave here?
DOCTOR: Uh yeah probably.  I'll be right back okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  73:49  DOCTOR IN:  84:00)
DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Um tell me about this chest pain.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: What does it feel like, sharp, dull, stabbing, pressure?
PATIENT: It's uh dull.  It's kind of like I just get hit in the chest you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it goes away and I feel sore for a while.
DOCTOR: How long does it usually last you?
PATIENT: It lasts maybe half hour to an hour and then it goes away and my chest stays sore for a while but the actual pain itself, [REDACTED] but it stays sore for maybe another hour or so and then it goes away.
DOCTOR: What are you usually doing when you get the chest pain?
PATIENT: Uh when it first started I'd be painting or spraying you know removing mold, whatever I was doing [REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh the past week it's it usually occurs when I'm at the house and you know most time it happens at night when windows are closed, my apartment gets too warm the pain will hit me again or if I walk to the store, walking back sometimes the pain will hit me.  Um you know I thought that perhaps I just inhaled too many fumes and too much paint and too much boric acid.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know bleach and stuff that I was using to clean all this mold and stuff you know so you know the pain is gradually getting better, it's not hurting as much but I thought maybe I could put something in a vaporizer or something and help clean whatever it is out.  A lot of times it hurts and I'll start coughing you know and you know phlegm or something will come up.
DOCTOR: Well does the shortness of breath start first or chest pain start first?
PATIENT: The shortness of breath I get now, I assume that was from just being fat but the shortness of breath has gotten worse since this started but uh I've had the shortness of breath now for I guess six, seven months.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Uh so what I am saying is that when you walk to the store and back you get short of breath first and then get chest pain or do you get chest pain first and then get short of breath?
PATIENT: The shortness of breath came first.
DOCTOR: The shortness of breath comes first.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you're short of breath and then you get chest pain and then you rest.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: And it gets better.
PATIENT: Right uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um does the pain move anywhere?
PATIENT: No it's like basically right in the middle of my chest.
SECONE DOCTOR F109
And you feel like you can't breathe in deep or that doesn't happen?
PATIENT: If I breathe in deep and it hurts more, sometimes I'll take a big breath.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know what I'm saying, as deep as I can take and then I'll start coughing and choking and stuff will come up.
DOCTOR: Are you using cocaine?  When was the last time you used?
PATIENT: No.  The last time I used was I think back in June.
DOCTOR: Alright.  We need some blood tests today and I also want a urine sample okay.  You did not give us one back in July; you need to give us one today okay.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Um you know you had that stress test.  It was a good stress test that you had done back in August or July or whenever it was a few months ago.  It did not show you had any blockages in your heart that we can see.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Uh it's not the best test for checking to see if you have blockages but it's the next best test.  The best test is to put a you know a catheter in your groin and go up into your heart and look, you know, an angiogram.  I think that at this point in time it's kind of a little bit invasive.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Because it seems like I think this is more lung problem maybe than actually a cardiac heart problem.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So what we would like to do is we're gonna go ahead and start you on an inhaler and I want you to carry it around with you always and whenever you start getting short of breath I want you to use the inhaler.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay we're also going to get some blood tests done.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Are you a smoker too?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Tobacco smoker?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Ever?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Never?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Um have you had a chest x-ray recently here?
PATIENT: I might have had one last year or the year before.
DOCTOR: A year ago.
PATIENT: Also could you tell me how many, I know last year I had both the flu shots and this year last week I took the flu shot.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] one time, you've had the vaccine.
PATIENT: Yeah I know.  Have I had the pneumonia shot at all?
DOCTOR: Um usually we wait till you're 65 with the pneumonia shot.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Unless you're having lung problems.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: We're diagnosing now and if we find you have lung problems then we'll go ahead and give it to you.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'll just [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well I mean, have you been working in carpentry or construction for years?
PATIENT: No this is like a sideline and then you know I've never had problems until you know I've been working on this one for about a month, month and a half.  You know I've been around a lot of different chemicals.
DOCTOR: And when did your um.
PATIENT: The pain just started last week.
DOCTOR: You know you may have had this thing for a long time, that’s why we had your stress test was done.
PATIENT: Okay, the pain I was having was chest pain was kind of related to my heart now it feels like it's my lungs because it's just like the pressure isn't over here.  Like before I was having it felt like something was popped loose and it pushed in against my heart.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now this feels like it's in the middle of my chest and my lungs.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll get a chest x-ray and we'll do the lung tests.  You can actually go upstairs and get the lung test today and do the blood work [REDACTED] um.
PATIENT: Can I do it another time?
DOCTOR: Yeah you can come in whenever you want to do it [REDACTED].  Uh we'll go ahead and get blood tests, get a urine sample today.  I don't want you to use any cocaine at all.  Have you used this drug before?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Tobacco?
PATIENT: All I ever smoked was marijuana and cocaine.
DOCTOR: Crack?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How much cocaine did you used to smoke?
PATIENT: I used to smoke uh during the day I'd smoke every day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But uh in the past I'd [REDACTED] about five, six years I might of smoked maybe ten times in six years so.
DOCTOR: So before six years you were smoking every day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: For how many years?
PATIENT: Oh I almost [REDACTED].  I smoked a little every day for probably 15 years, 10 years, something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um now cocaine actually, you know just like tobacco we tell people that can actually cause lung damage, cocaine actually causes lung damage in fewer smokes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So it’s actually quite bad.  Um we'll do the lung tests and then we'll see we'll go from there but the inhaler I want you to carry around and I want you to use it whenever you get short of breath and we'll see if your symptoms get better.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We'll have you come back in about a month, two months, okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And you said you smoked cocaine for ten years or so?
PATIENT: I started smoking cocaine, I mean on a regular basis I was smoking for about ten years but I started smoking I think in about maybe 85.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: 85 probably until 2000 on a regular basis and then the last, then I started smoking like maybe once a month but the last five years has been like maybe twice a year.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then before that when you said regularly was that daily?
PATIENT: Uh for ten years it was almost every day I smoked at least ten dollars’ worth.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But uh then I went to every weekend that I smoked a couple of hundred dollars’ worth and then finally it got to kind of where I am now where I don't even think about smoking it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you're all set for your x-ray and your labs and then your lung function tests okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um go ahead and go to your labs first and then go to your x-ray and then go to the lung function tests.  I would just ask them where the Pulmonary Lab is when you get your x-ray okay.  The Lab is across the hallway.  Once you're done with the labs you can go all the way down the hallway it's on the left hand side, it's X-Ray.
PATIENT: Okay now she said since I have to be here Wednesday morning anyway.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh and I have a couple of things I'm supposed to do this evening.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She said I could take the lung thing on Wednesday.
DOCTOR: Sure that's fine too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay um and then your albuterol inhaler, I prescribed it for you, let me see maybe I should change it so you could pick it up at the window.  You can go ahead and pick that up at the window okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we'll see you back actually pretty closely from now on okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright and I'll put the thing in to the order, then you'll get a letter at home in the mail okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: So I can go do the blood tests now.
DOCTOR: Blood tests now and then an x-ray.
