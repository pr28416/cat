DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes sir.
DOCTOR: How you doing today sir?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: You can come back here.  Good to see you, how have you been doing?
PATIENT: Uh I been okay I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Good uh.
PATIENT: Can't really complain.
DOCTOR: That is good to hear.  I see your blood pressure's a little bit high today though.
PATIENT: Well I just came straight from Physical Therapy.
DOCTOR: I saw that, I saw that, yeah.
PATIENT: So that was probably it.
DOCTOR: Physical Therapy was for your back huh?
PATIENT: Yeah for the lower back.
DOCTOR: How's that been doing?
PATIENT: I don't know it's really changed that much yet it's.
DOCTOR: Has it gotten any better?
PATIENT: Maybe just a little bit but not a whole lot so.
DOCTOR: So remind me, what happened to your back?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] I don't think I remember that.
PATIENT: No you didn't, the arthritis doctor did I think.
DOCTOR: Oh gotcha.
PATIENT: Because they were saying that I got arthritis in the back and the shoulders and the knees.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  I gotcha.
PATIENT: Uh before I forget it, all of your prescriptions DOCTOR you need to renew the prescriptions.
DOCTOR: I will take care of that today.  Yep that's not a problem.  I'm just uh taking a second to catch up on what you've been doing.  There are a lot of Rehabilitation Notes in here.  You've been to the MOVE Program.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That looks good. [REDACTED] better than when I last saw you.  Following up with Anticoagulation.  How about the liver, have you seen the liver guys?
PATIENT: Yeah uh, they told me I got the hepatitis C.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Okay.
PATIENT: But they said, the way I understand it it's in the mid stages.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I don't really need any treatment at this point, just try to keep everything.
DOCTOR: Just keep following with them yeah.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And we're not drinking anymore right?
PATIENT: No I haven't had a beer in almost a year so, any kind of alcohol that I know of intentionally so.
DOCTOR: Gotcha.
PATIENT: Maybe that's why I've dropped about 27 or 28 pounds.
DOCTOR: Yeah and that'll help your blood pressure too uh.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Seen here for follow-up.  Have you been trying to lose weight?
PATIENT: Not really no, I just.  When I'm hungry I eat and when I'm not hungry I don't eat which.
DOCTOR: Gotcha.
PATIENT: It seems like I used to get a craving for something and couldn't figure out what I was craving so I'd nibble everything and never find it but I haven't been getting that craving so I guess.
DOCTOR: You may just be eating less.
PATIENT: That's all that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Okay good.  So looks like you've been doing pretty good.  How's your diabetes been doing?
PATIENT: Diabetes?
DOCTOR: How's your sugars?  Have you been eating okay?
PATIENT: I guess so, I didn't know.
DOCTOR: Well we started you on metformin I believe.  A medicine to control your sugars.
PATIENT: I don’t…
DOCTOR: Have you been taking that?
PATIENT: I.
DOCTOR: Let's run through your medicines and figure out what you're taking and what you're not, how about that?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so there's a couple of creams here, I’m not too interested in those.  The Coumadin you still take right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: It looks like that needs a refill.
PATIENT: Yeah it does.
DOCTOR: Just in the mail?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you follow at the Coumadin Clinic?
PATIENT: Yeah I follow up with that.
DOCTOR: Alright.  The stomach medicine?
PATIENT: The what?
DOCTOR: There's a stomach medicine omeprazole.
PATIENT: Oh that's that little capsule for the.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: For the.
DOCTOR: Acid reflux?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you take that right?
PATIENT: I'm still taking that yeah.
DOCTOR: Valsartan, that's a medicine for uh blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay the little white pill?
DOCTOR: I don't know the color of it.  You take the blood pressure pill Valsartan?
PATIENT: There's two or three, three I can't remember which ones.  There's three of them.
DOCTOR: Uh how about tramadol?  That was one of the pain pills.
PATIENT: Yeah that was the, the arthritis doctor gave me that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Digoxin?
PATIENT: Digoxin yeah I got that.  It's the third blood pressure pill.
DOCTOR: It helps with your atrial fibrillation.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: For rate control.  Um metoprolol?
PATIENT: Okay the metoprolol I'm taking.
DOCTOR: You're taking 100 mg; you take that twice a day right?
PATIENT: Twice a day yeah, one pill I cut it in half and one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Half in the morning and half in the.
DOCTOR: Alright let's see, looks like they gave you some prednisone for a short time, that's gone okay.  That's mostly your medicines, is that right?
PATIENT: That sounds like it.
DOCTOR: Next time I want you to bring the medicine bottles in or bring a list of what you uh for sure take.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But that's what I got on the list here.
PATIENT: Okay but I don't have anything for diabetic that I know of.
DOCTOR: The last time we talked about but we didn't give it to you.
PATIENT: Yeah something about the blood count was close or whatever so we didn't.
DOCTOR: Right.  That's why we sent you to the MOVE Clinic.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Now I remember.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Now I remember.  Um did you eat anything this morning?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: No okay.  We may draw some labs.  Your Coumadin level's been pretty good.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Let see what your sugars, this was last June.  So last June you had some labs drawn in June.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: By 9 o'clock in the morning.  Do you happen to remember if you had eaten that day?
PATIENT: I don't think I did.
DOCTOR: You don't think you did.
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause most time when I come here I don't eat.
DOCTOR: You don't eat just in case huh.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So the other thing is before your glucose was 146, so it's better um.  We're going to draw some labs today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Depending what your sugars are.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I might want to start you on a medicine for pre-diabetes.
PATIENT: Okay.  Pre-diabetes, does that mean, to intercept sort of.
DOCTOR: You're right, from getting full-blown diabetes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The way we diagnose diabetes is we take your blood.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And look to see what the sugar level is.  If the sugar is 125 or higher, two separate times after you haven't eaten for 12 hours or so then we can say you have diabetes.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You're right on the border so back in June you were 126, that's elevated.  When I saw you before you were 140, also elevated.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So those two together we basically can diagnose you with diabetes.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But because you've been doing good, you lost some weight, you went to the MOVE Clinic, they exercised you right?
PATIENT: Yeah but actually uh I didn't lose it during the whole time I was with the MOVE Clinic I didn't lose one single, yeah I lost one pound.  I've lost all this weight since I left the MOVE Clinic.
DOCTOR: Huh.
PATIENT: I don't know if it's just now starting to catch up with me or if it's because I quit drinking the beer or what it is.
DOCTOR: That could be, that could be.  Um.
PATIENT: Cause I quit drinking the beer after I found out about the hepatitis.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then I never really drank a lot of beer, that was just like maybe two beers a day was about it so.  I don't think that's that much.  Saved me a lot of money though.
DOCTOR: We just recently diagnosed you with that hepatitis right?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, within the last, about a year.  You suspected a year ago and you finally finished all the tests maybe six or seven months ago.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: To confirm it.
DOCTOR: And we think that may be from a blood transfusion back when.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You had the surgery for your stomach.
PATIENT: Right and then that's another thing, I applied for the VA benefits to be increased and they sent me a letter of rejection saying of course I can re you know.
DOCTOR: Reapply?
PATIENT: Reapply or whatever within the year but they said that they didn't think that that transfusion, it was so long ago, would have give it to me.  But it's a possibility for me to have it ever since then and not really know about it right?
DOCTOR: Right yeah.  I think we talked about that last time.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And I put it in the note here.
PATIENT: Yeah and I know they had access to the records.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And everything so.  But what I'm not quite understanding they said something about they were holding at 20%.  I think that means they raised it by 10% because I been drawing 10% so I'm not quite sure if they raised it a little bit or not.  Cause I just got the letters recently so.
DOCTOR: Let's see did they weigh you today?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They did, let's see what.
PATIENT: She did.
DOCTOR: Your weight is 244.
PATIENT: I was down another pound or two so.
DOCTOR: So you were 258 yeah so that's good, let's see where you were a year ago.  Yeah that's pretty good.
PATIENT: A year ago.
DOCTOR: That’s pretty good. [REDACTED] something we're concerned about.
PATIENT: A year ago I was up probably somewhere around 260 or 270 I'm guessing.
DOCTOR: Yeah you were 270.
PATIENT: Yeah 270.
DOCTOR: 270.5.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Today 244.
PATIENT: So that's close to.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Getting close to 30 pounds.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's about 30 pounds, just under 30 pounds.  So that's pretty good and you've been trying to do better?
PATIENT: Well actually I haven't been trying at all, it's just.
DOCTOR: You haven't been trying at all.
PATIENT: Not really.
DOCTOR: So sometimes that can be concerning.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Losing weight without trying.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That can be concerning.
PATIENT: Well, my diet has changed because I'm not, so well I eat a lot more fruit and stuff than I was before.  I love fruit.
DOCTOR: So you're eating healthier.
PATIENT: Probably yeah.
DOCTOR: Did the MOVE Clinic help with anything?  They tell you how to eat better?
PATIENT: Well that's one thing they did do because I've always liked fruit and everything and they kind of led me along the lines of stuff that I like pretty well but I wasn't really eating a whole lot that I like but so that kind of switched.  So they did have me switch my diet a little I think so that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um you still live with your wife right?
PATIENT: Correct.
DOCTOR: And before you told me you were sleeping in different rooms because your wife moves too much?
PATIENT: No she says I move too.
DOCTOR: You move.
PATIENT: Yeah.  She says I get to screaming and hollering for some reason.  I couldn't see where it would be my military experiencing causing any of that though so.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah they got me on that sleeping thing too but that doesn't seem to me that it's doing.
DOCTOR: What oh CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's good, that'll help your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Well, it takes me twice as long to go to sleep and then I wake up about every 30 minutes or so where before I used to go to sleep real quick and not wake up so.
DOCTOR: But they, I think I ordered that for you.
PATIENT: Ah somebody did, yeah, yeah you did.
DOCTOR: So they said you're having sleep apnea huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's not real bad just slight you know.
DOCTOR: You been using that sleeping machine all the time?
PATIENT: I'd say 90% of the time.
DOCTOR: Well that probably could help you lose weight too, believe it or not.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  I been probably about 90% of the time I use it.  When we went on our vacation we were camping out in the woods, there was no electrical so I didn't use it that week.
DOCTOR: Right.  No that's okay.  Where'd you camp at?
PATIENT: Uh Devil's Den in Arkansas.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like you're more awake now?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like may have more energy?  Cause sometimes when you have sleep apnea you get tired during the day.
PATIENT: Uh, I seem to stay awake a little bit better but yeah.
DOCTOR: You don't feel as fatigued huh?
PATIENT: I still feel fatigued quite a bit but not quite as much as I did I guess maybe it's just, I'm not sure if it's that or not.
DOCTOR: You know seems like everything got a little bit better.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We may have done something right.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: And I would tell you that we probably should get another colonoscopy but you just had one, just had one.
PATIENT: Yeah I just had it.
DOCTOR: Last year so.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You're good to go.
PATIENT: Well they told me I was good for another ten years.  I tell you what the pre-treatment's worse than the.
DOCTOR: That's the worst.  Did I do that to you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think I did do that to you.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah you did.
DOCTOR: Well we're getting you squared away though.  The only thing I want to see is when was the last time you had your cholesterol checked?
PATIENT: God I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: That may have been a little while.
PATIENT: I thought that was.
DOCTOR: That was last September.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: You're probably due for that.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So we can probably check your lipids.  Probably check your BMP.  We can check an A1c.
PATIENT: Well there's something else I want you to check, my left testicle for some reason.
DOCTOR: What's happened?
PATIENT: Uh it feels like, I feel uncomfortable, a little bit of pain in it, not a lot.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And feel a little bit of pressure, sometimes it comes uh and it's getting where it's more often.  The thing of it is if I don't go urinate or something.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it relieves, and the pain and pressure seem to relieve and go away.
DOCTOR: So pain in the left testicle right.
PATIENT: Right.  It's not real severe but it's you know.  It's and it feels like pressure and pain a little bit.
DOCTOR: Every day?
PATIENT: Yeah at least once a day or so.  Uh usually like I say I go urinate or something and, I have no problem with urination or anything like that.
DOCTOR: No problem.  Okay.  No burning.
PATIENT: No burning, no nothing.  It's just.
DOCTOR: So tell me more about your pain.
PATIENT: It's almost like.
DOCTOR: When did it come?
PATIENT: Well, different, sometimes at nighttime, sometimes in the middle of the day just, never any set time it just uh.  Feels like somebody kind of taking hold of it and kind of squeezing it a little bit or something.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What does it feel like, does it last a long time or is it just a few seconds?
PATIENT: No it lasts until I go urinate or something.  It starts out slightly and then it starts getting a little bit more and more pressure and a little bit more pain until I go to the washroom or something, relieve myself and then it seems to go away then for a while.  Now this has been going on probably for two or three months now but I don't know how long it's been going on.
DOCTOR: A few months?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Alright well why don't I have you sit up there and uh I'll take your blood pressure first cause I want to check and see if that's for real or.
PATIENT: Here?
DOCTOR: It's probably just because you walked.  So you had rehab today?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: What were you doing over there?
PATIENT: They just had me doing.
DOCTOR: For the back.
PATIENT: Yeah it's for the back yeah they.
DOCTOR: How's the back pain doing?
PATIENT: It seems to be there all the time.  I mean it's not as severe as it was before but it seems like it ain't going away but.  It's been that way for years it seems like, just a.
DOCTOR: A little squeeze sorry.  So it's definitely not as high as it was.  Sorry.
PATIENT: No problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, I got about 130/80.
PATIENT: That's not bad.
DOCTOR: Not terrible, not terrible.  Alright um, I'm going to examine you too.  I'll have you take some deep breaths.  Again.  Good, again, good, again.  Okay I'm just going to feel your pulse.  Okay.  You still have that irregular heartbeat.
PATIENT: Yeah, I'll probably have that the rest of my life I guess.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it seems like I'm.
DOCTOR: Do you ever get swelling in the legs?
PATIENT: Yeah from time to time.  Seems like I run out of breath a lot easier than.
DOCTOR: Than before?
PATIENT: Than before too now so.
DOCTOR: Lay back.  I'm just going to feel on your belly a little bit.  So how far can you walk now?
PATIENT: I don't know.  I really don't know.
DOCTOR: You been doing physical therapy, you getting short of breath or no?
PATIENT: No when I'm working upstairs, it's like when I go up the stairs or something.
DOCTOR: Take your drawers off and we'll take a look at that.  When you go up the stairs you get short of breath?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How far can you go?
PATIENT: I don't know I'm not really trying but just seem like I'm winded when I get to the top of the stairs where I used to.  Drop the drawers and everything all the way down?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I'll take a look here.
PATIENT: I've never really tried to see how far I could go or anything.
DOCTOR: But you notice that now you can't go as far?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you ever had a stress test?
PATIENT: Been a long time but yeah I had one.
DOCTOR: Show me where it's been bothering you the most.
PATIENT: Right in through there.
DOCTOR: Is it sore where I touch?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm just going to check you for a hernia okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Go ahead and cough.  Again.  Same on the other side, cough.  I don't see anything obvious.  I'll ask my attending and see if we need to check the urine to make sure there's no infection in there.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um I'll see if he wants to come take a look at it.  The stress test was taken a long time ago right.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Back when I first started.  The last time was when I first started coming here on a regular basis.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that's when I wanted because I already knew I had the a fib.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: But of course they wanted their own you know, so that was the last time I took it, the chemical one or whatever.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No that's okay.  I'm just going to see when you had a stress test last.  You had a treadmill.
PATIENT: I don't remember doing a treadmill.
DOCTOR: Sorry, I lied. Well this was in August 2009 they did an echocardiogram.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Did I do that?  That might have been something I ordered hmm.  But that looks pretty good.  Yeah that one's pretty good.  So the symptom of shortness of breath is only with exertion right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's when you start to get a little more winded?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just normal walking around it doesn't seem like.
DOCTOR: Oh when you.
PATIENT: Like when I ride the bike over there, it didn't seem to bother me.
DOCTOR: You have to ride a bike on a stationary place?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: When does it seem to come, going up and down the stairs?
PATIENT: Going up and down the stairs, something like that or outside when it's real hot, on a real hot day.
DOCTOR: Do you think you could walk on a treadmill if we wanted you to?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'll talk with my attending about that.  I want to get some labs for you too.
PATIENT: Okay is that going to be done today or?
DOCTOR: Hopefully yeah, the labs.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm just going to go talk with him and then we'll go from there okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright hold on one second.  So, it says 20% service-connected right?
PATIENT: That's what it says?
DOCTOR: That's what it says in the computer.
PATIENT: Yeah before it was only 10% so I guess that they must have upped it.
DOCTOR: They may have.  Alright I'll be back in one second, okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Hang tight for me.
(DOCTOR OUT:  63:55  DOCTOR IN:  73:22)
DOCTOR: Alright so, here's what we're going to do for you, couple things.  We're going to check the labs like we talked about.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh I also want to order two tests one is an ultrasound of your testicle making sure that there's no hydro-seal, there's no signs of cancer in there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: No problems that I couldn't find on examining you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It feels to me like it's pretty benign.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Depending what that shows we may send you to the urologist.  Now your symptoms don't sound too concerning and because they're mild I'm willing to watch them for a bit and see what happens with them.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Also number two, because of your increasing shortness of breath I want to do a stress test.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So all these, not today it's going to be.
DOCTOR: No, no, no.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound and the stress test are not going to be today correct.
PATIENT: Okay, but the lab.
DOCTOR: The labs will be today.
PATIENT: Well I just go down, that's blood right?
DOCTOR: You just go down or they can draw them here.
PATIENT: It doesn't matter to me if they want.
DOCTOR: If you want to just get them here I can put you in the Lab here, it might be quicker.
PATIENT: That's fine.
DOCTOR: Let me just, let me just order those labs so I can set you up there and get you in line.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um we're going to order a bit.
PATIENT: Okay you're going to redo all my prescriptions.
DOCTOR: I refilled them all already.
PATIENT: And you're going to add that one for the.
DOCTOR: What for.
PATIENT: For the pre-diabetes or whatever.
DOCTOR: Um I'm going to check a lab today called hemoglobin A1c.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That'll tell us how your sugars have been over the last three months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If that's high I'll send you a prescription for diabetes medicine okay.
PATIENT: Okay, alright.
DOCTOR: Um we're going to check your lipids.  I'm also going to check what's called alpha fetoprotein.  We checked that before.  We're going to check it again.  That's what monitors how your liver's doing.
PATIENT: Uh-huh okay.  Yeah the liver doctor said something about technically they should be checking that every time I come in anymore.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm going to check it now since you're here.
PATIENT: That again will be with the Lab right?
DOCTOR: Yeah, uh-huh.
PATIENT: So really once I leave the Lab I don't have to go anywhere today except.
DOCTOR: Home.
PATIENT: Then they'll be calling me and making.
DOCTOR: Yep they'll call you and get the ultrasound and the stress test taken care of.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So let's see I just got to figure how to order that alpha fetoprotein.
PATIENT: Beats me.
DOCTOR: Make sure that you give them urine too.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And we probably should check your prostate, so a PSA.
PATIENT: I thought you did that once before.
DOCTOR: We did.
PATIENT: And it came back clean but it still you can't be.
DOCTOR: This is something you check about once a year.
PATIENT: Okay.  Just as long as it ain't nothing like that colon thing.
DOCTOR: No this is a blood test.
PATIENT: Whew.
DOCTOR: Yeah that was bad huh?
PATIENT: Man drinking that stuff, I couldn't even get off the pot; I just sit there and drain.
DOCTOR: Sorry about that.
PATIENT: When they said it'd be ten years before I have to take it again maybe by then they'll have something better.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Ten years before you have to do it again and at that time you may consider not even doing it you know.
PATIENT: If I live to be another ten years old.
DOCTOR: Right exactly.  Alright so let's see here, the ultrasound, scrotum.  I'll order it today and I'll tell them in the front.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: They'll take my urine sample here too?
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I'm going to order a stress test and we're all set to go.  Stress test. What we're going to do is instead of the treadmill; well you could probably walk on a treadmill right?
PATIENT: Yeah I don't.
DOCTOR: What we'll do is you'll walk on the treadmill and then they'll give you.
PATIENT: The chemical.
DOCTOR: They'll give you an echo.
PATIENT: Oh that's a.
DOCTOR: And they may give you a chemical.  If you can't get your heart rate fast enough.
PATIENT: Will they give me the, I had that chemical done to me twice, once by you guys and once by.
DOCTOR: Oh you had a stress test before?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I don't see it in here.
PATIENT: You guys gave me one once, when I first.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: When I first started coming here on a regular basis, that's before you guys would give me the medication and everything for the a fib.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then I had one done at McNeal which was chemical.
DOCTOR: Alright so let me make sure I got your medicines renewed.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yep I got everything renewed that you need.  Um I'm not going to make any changes cause I think your blood pressure is okay for now.  Um that's it.  What I'm going to do is have you.
PATIENT: Wait up there for the.
DOCTOR: Have a seat out here.
PATIENT: And they'll call me for those other.
DOCTOR: I'm going to have you, nobody's here for the Lab. You can wait a few minutes and see.
PATIENT: Alrighty.
DOCTOR: If someone comes back if not then you can always go downstairs.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright.  I want to see you back in three months.
PATIENT: Three months.
DOCTOR: By then we'll have the ultrasound, we'll see what the labs show and we'll get a stress test.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Alrighty.
DOCTOR: Take care sir.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: You can just uh sit out there.
PATIENT: Back in [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: If they don't come back soon you can always go downstairs.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: And they can draw the blood downstairs but sometimes it's quicker here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
PATIENT: 79:17
Time is 10:35.
