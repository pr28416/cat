DOCTOR: How may I help you?
PATIENT: I'm I'm here because my right knee is very painful. It looks kind of swollen and it's it's also a little bit warm so I'm just worried, I'm worried about it and I was wondering if you could look at it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, certainly, um. So where are you feeling the the pain exactly?
PATIENT: So it's where, so right in the middle of my knee. So just below the bone that, the big knee bone.
DOCTOR: OK, so like underneath the kneecap, like below that?
PATIENT: Yeah just just a little bit below.
DOCTOR: OK, so slightly below the Patella. Sounds like somewhere in the region of the tibial through tuberosity.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: OK, and when did this pain start?
PATIENT: It started about two weeks ago.
DOCTOR: OK, two weeks ago when the pain started, was there any trauma or could you remember any movement that that caused the pain?
PATIENT: Nothing like that, but I recently found out that I had some osteoarthritis on my left knee, so I was trying to put more pressure on my right knee one whenever I was doing like gardening work um and I think something something may have happened when I was doing that, something maybe, maybe I put too much strain on it.
DOCTOR: OK, I see an. Alright, like are you doing a lot of kneeling on on or during the gardening work?

DOCTOR: OK, have you tried anything to make the pain better?
PATIENT: I tried some topical like what are those like ice and fire gels. Those seem to help temporarily, but the pain comes back.
DOCTOR: OK. And. Have you tried, has anything made the pain worse?
PATIENT: I guess like when I kneel down on it, it gets painful or If I touch it or palpate it, I guess painful if I'm I'm flexing my knee too much that hurts as well. Kind of keeping it straight and not touching it makes it feel better.
DOCTOR: OK, and. What would you say the severity of the pain is with 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt and one being the least pain?

DOCTOR: OK. So next I just wanted to do the physical exam portion and ask you to have a look at the knee first and let me know if the if you're having any swelling, redness or warmth to the knee compared to the other side.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Sorry so you are having, having swelling, warmth and redness to the right knee?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: OK and are you having pain to like palpation is there a specific spot you can press on that causes a sharp pain?
PATIENT: Um so just below that kneecap area there is some swelling there and when I press down on that swollen area, it causes a bit of pain.
DOCTOR: OK. And are you able to fully bend, bend and straighten the knee?
PATIENT: I can do that, but when I bend my knee it really hurts.
DOCTOR: OK. And are you able to walk normally or do you have a limp?
PATIENT: Um I can walk normally, it just hurts.
DOCTOR: OK. So that was a everything that I wanted to ask today on the history and and physical. Was there anything? That you maybe I forgot about you wanted to add?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: OK, so right now it's sounding like this could possibly be a knee Bursitis. Or Prepatellar, or sorry, infra patellar bursitis or a prepatellar bursistis which are the kind of the more common types. One thing to make sure that we rule out would be a septic Bursitis. Although you're not having any fevers or chills so that makes it a little bit less likely.
PATIENT: Mmmm
DOCTOR: But if your symptoms are getting worse and you're developing a fever, it's becoming even more painful then certainly will have to rule out infection. And as well if things are not improving, potentially a structural disease and any, such as a meniscal injury, or like a ligamental injury from all of the like kneeling and and repetitive movements. But right now I think it's mostly sounding like a knee bursitis.
PATIENT: OK.
DOCTOR: OK, and treatment for that will be activity modification as well as using things like as um NSAIDS and icing to help with um the inflammation.
PATIENT: OK, that sounds good, thank you.
