DOCTOR: Alright so I think that's all I wanted to cover on the history today. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me I maybe didn't ask?
PATIENT: Um no, I was just curious if you think I had COVID?
DOCTOR: Certainly one of the top things that I'm considering after hearing about your symptoms of having this cough and fever and being tired these last few days, especially with your husband being sick with nausea, vomiting, and not feeling well. That being said, it could be another type of viral illness, or possibly a bacterial infection. But certainly we will order some investigations, some blood work, a PCR nasal swab that will actually test for COVID as well as a chest X Ray to start with. Um and we will wait for some of those results to come back.
PATIENT: OK, yeah, that sounds good.
DOCTOR: Alright, so we'll get that started.
PATIENT: OK, thank you.
