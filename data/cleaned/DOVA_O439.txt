DOCTOR: PATIENT.

DOCTOR: Good.  Nice to meet you.
PATIENT: We got lost.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Is that it?
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, so how's things been?
PATIENT: Well I feel much better than I've felt in a long time.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Very good.
PATIENT: I felt bad all summer you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, right.
PATIENT: You know so.
DOCTOR: You're doing better now.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm feeling better.  I mean I still you know get lightheaded after I walk for about a mile and a half.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: I mean, I don't know if it's lightheaded or wobbly or whatever but and uh I still have that left eye feels like something is pushing out of it but you know I don't know that is swelling or getting dry or something.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I've had all that checked and they can't find anything at all.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know he looked in my ears.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: A couple of weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And there was an irritation in there but they didn't.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: They didn't, I mean when they touched it, it was uh, there was a little spot that was real sore but they didn't make anything of it or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright, you're gonna go back and see the neurology doctors it looks like.
PATIENT: I cancelled that because it's like I mean, they just, I mean it's just the same thing over and over so I'm just so I cancelled that and I cancelled my, I had a rheumatology because my arms and everything was shaking but.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh since I've started doing yoga it feels better.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And there are certain things I have been doing to exercise with my arms so I just think that maybe that was part of it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh my, the quick burst of headaches that I was having.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They are gone away, for the most part.  Every now and then I might have a quick burst but.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's gone you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The only thing that's really bothering me now is for some reason I get pain down in my lower abdomen.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'd say my bladder but I don't know what it is like to my right side and then down to my abdomen so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Sometimes and that doesn't happen all the time but when it does it's just kind of quick and intense.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And one time it did stop me from moving for a while after I used the washroom I couldn't move.
DOCTOR: I see.
PATIENT: So but that's, you know that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So it's uh, okay when was the last time you had it?
PATIENT: Uh actually it feels sore now.  It happens a few times a week.  I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But the first time that it happened was about a month ago I think and I'd used the washroom, I was out and I used the washroom and I went to, I walked out of the washroom and a pain hit me and I could not move.  I had to stand there for a while so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then it you know it just uh comes and it goes.  It's nothing, I've noticed no blood.  There's no discoloration of my urine, it's a light yellow and.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know, so I don't know if maybe I'm holding my urine too long or.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um is there any burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No there's no burning.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Are you urinating more frequently than normal?
PATIENT: No.  I mean if I drink more water I will.
DOCTOR: Right, right, yeah.
PATIENT: But you know, but no.
DOCTOR: Um okay, um so this belly pain, it's on the, starts up on the right side and then.
PATIENT: It's right here, it's almost like, it's right, it's right here on my left side and I've had problems with this on and off, this side here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then look and this is where it really hurts.
DOCTOR: It hurts down there.
PATIENT: Down underneath my bladder like.
DOCTOR: When did that start?
PATIENT: Um the first episode I had was about, see I don't know if I had been having slight pains before when I had that bladder infection or whatever infection I had but I don't recall it so it must not have been that significant.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But when I, about a month ago, when I used the washroom and then I went out and I went to walk and it's, after I washed my hands I stepped out the washroom and wow that pain hit me, so I said wow.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It was sharp and intense.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So and.
DOCTOR: Okay, just when you were using the restroom?
PATIENT: Yeah, but that time but it comes like if I'm sitting down.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Or something and I get up, I might feel it or something so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause actually I feel it right now in my left side but it's, it's not like intense, it's just you know.
DOCTOR: Okay and is it just at the time when you're urinating or is it just like when you're like sitting down or?
PATIENT: Well sometimes I'm, it seems to like it's more like when I'm sitting down and I get up or something.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know but, you know it's, you know but it's, it doesn't come that.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: You know it comes but it's not like regular or all the time or constant I should say.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But uh and the only other thing I wanted to mention is I got these little white moles coming in my face now, in the last couple of months.
DOCTOR: Moles you're saying?
PATIENT: Yeah there's one, it's real hard too.
DOCTOR: Yeah I see it.
PATIENT: And then I was looking, I thought this was a crumb or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I see.
PATIENT: And I kept wiping it.
DOCTOR: And it doesn't wipe off.
PATIENT: Right and then I tried to you know burst it but it won't.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: It's really hard.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I say what the heck is that now?
DOCTOR: Like what's going on yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah and those just appeared, this one just appeared, the one by my mouth just appeared about a month ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And the other one was maybe two or three months ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.
PATIENT: So I know you get old all kinds of things start popping out so.
DOCTOR: Sounds good right.  Let me see, if you brought [REDACTED] the last time.  [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Yeah that's, that's getting better.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: That's getting better I had uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah but, thank God that part is over.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it seems like my face is getting better on this side so it may have had something to do with my root canal.  Every now and then I get a little numbness.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh and I do have another tooth over there that they got to work on but.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I'm trying to put that off as long as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I got it.
PATIENT: You know I broke my bridge so that's number one now, I gotta get that fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm getting an implant and uh.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: It's probably before, I had a bridge here and the front tooth is gone.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I'm gonna get an implant there.  Let me stop talking so you can look up whatever.
DOCTOR: Oh no, I'm just taking a look see if it's uh, cause I know you back in August you saw the GI doctors.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Other than that, it looks really good.  Okay you still taking the omeprazole?  The acid blocker?
PATIENT: No I don't take any of that anymore.
DOCTOR: You aren't.
PATIENT: I stopped taking that man.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: A long time ago, I quit you know.  I don't want to get caught up in it, you know I just try to not eat late and not go to bed.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: On a full stomach and stuff that I can do to kind of help it you know.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And so for the most part that's okay.  Every now and then I might eat something that makes me a little bit nauseated but.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Other than that you know but.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Now when's the last time you've seen the Women's Health?  Do you go see them?
PATIENT: I haven't been up there ever since last year but it is coming up.
DOCTOR: About that time yeah.
PATIENT: Time for me to order uh, for them to order a mammogram.
DOCTOR: Yes exactly.  I can put that in.
PATIENT: Probably takes a long time to get that appointment maybe like two months or something.
DOCTOR: Right.  Correct.
PATIENT: I mean to get the mammogram set-up; it takes a long time cause I go to the University of Illinois.  They don't do them here.
DOCTOR: Oh okay you go over there to U of I.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, do you see Women's Health here or do you go?
PATIENT: Yes but I have to see Women's Health here.
DOCTOR: Got it.
PATIENT: And then they refer me to the U of I.
DOCTOR: Got it, okay.
PATIENT: Cause they just started doing the mammograms.
DOCTOR: Alright, okay uh alright, [REDACTED] files here.  Your blood testing looks great.  You started yoga which is awesome.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, yeah, I do that pretty often.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know doctor uh my blood pressure, I know that its, people always tell me the blood pressure's great but it's kind of sporadic to me and I don't know what that's about.  Like I, when I went to get my implant.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They examine for that, do you want me to take this off?
DOCTOR: Yes please.
PATIENT: Okay, when I went to get that examined uh he, my blood pressure was like 106/88, which is a weird number.
DOCTOR: Right, um.
PATIENT: 88 that 88 being so high like that.
DOCTOR: So that's, okay.  You know the thing is there's a pretty wide variation in blood pressure cuffs and blood pressures so honestly like.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We do it.
PATIENT: Maybe something was wrong with their cuff, cause that's weird.
DOCTOR: The only time we get excited about blood pressure being too high is when you're consistently elevated for like multiple readings over like the course of a month.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, so I mean if you had an isolated reading that's high, it could just be the cuff.
PATIENT: You said cuff?
DOCTOR: Sorry a blood pressure cuff.
PATIENT: Oh I'm sorry.  Don’t I'm think I'm not happy I'm not taking blood pressure medicine.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: Cause cholesterol is bad enough.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths in and out.  And again.  And again.  And again.  Go ahead and lie back for me.  So belly pain comes off and on, usually when you're in the washroom sitting down.
PATIENT: Well not necessarily in the washroom sitting down but when I'm sitting, like if I'm in the living room sitting and I get up.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I can feel it down here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it's on the right side, it's not, the left side somewhat but it's on the right and right here, just a little bit.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But I said man there must be a line or something going from here to here.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Causing that cause now it's more to the right.  I didn't say I didn't mean the left; it's more to the right than it is to the left.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Can you go ahead and just pull your shirt up a little bit just so I can see your skin.  Any relationship to food whatsoever?  Meals.
PATIENT: No I haven't noticed any of that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's a little tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, got it, okay.  [REDACTED] down there?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: A little painful there now?
PATIENT: It's a little.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any tenderness over here?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Just a little bit in there [REDACTED].  This one here at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any problems with diarrhea?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Blood in you - so are you just ticklish or painful?
PATIENT: Painful.
DOCTOR: Over here.
PATIENT: When you press on it right here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Sometimes I feel like a pressure like at my naval, under my naval.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  No problems with bowel movements?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting or anything like that?
PATIENT: No I'm just hot and cold all the time, that's.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: That's hormones things.
DOCTOR: Right, got it.
PATIENT: And I'm doing my exercises and even if I get tired I keep going.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I'm trying to mix it up, you know I'm trying real hard to lose weight but [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But I'm trying to eat [REDACTED].  I'm you know making fruit smoothies and stuff.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had your gallbladder out?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Have you ever had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Um no, no.
DOCTOR: When you had that uh the aneurysm in your aorta.
PATIENT: I still do.
DOCTOR: Okay, you had uh a mesh placed or a repair?
PATIENT: No, it's not [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: None of the above, we just were watching it.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: The last time they it was three months ago in April.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think they said they want to do another one in six months.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: After that but I, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Pardon.
DOCTOR: Are you having any back pain?
PATIENT: Uh just lower back but I attribute that to uh right along in here, I attribute that to my yoga poses.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause what I do is I do uh twists.
DOCTOR: Lean forward [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No I do twists; you know I do twists where I'm twisting by contorting my body.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And they said it was okay to keep doing all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I'm twisting my upper torso one way and the lower part of my body the other way trying to exercise my spine.
DOCTOR: Right.  Right.
PATIENT: And so then after I do that and then some of the uh the standing yoga poses where you, forget the name of the one, it's a common one where you stand with your legs opened and your knees slightly bent and you [REDACTED] backwards, slightly backward stance.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, I'm not sure the name of it either.
PATIENT: I forget the name of it, God I can't believe I forget the name of it.
DOCTOR: I don't know.
PATIENT: Um you know it hurts a little bit and I have to uh do something to loosen it up.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay.  I'm just trying to figure out if we should get that CAT scan.  They wanted to do that repeat CAT scan uh to keep an eye on that aorta uh but I don't think that we.  You know now that you're having pain, you might want to get that, get it repeated a little sooner because we'll see uh.
PATIENT: No I just assumed that if I had a problem with the aorta that my back would be, I would have sharp intense pains in the upper part of my back.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  That’s normally how it presents [REDACTED] back [REDACTED], you're absolutely right.  It's kind of atypical.  Um do you think you strained a muscle or something doing the yoga?  Is that possible?
PATIENT: No I can tell when I strain a muscle.
DOCTOR: It's not like that?
PATIENT: No it's not, it's not a muscle strain and I wondered I said man am I passing uh, the calcium that comes in there, cause I was taking so much calcium but I decided to ease up off of that calcium and actually I've been lax with taking my vitamins.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But I eased off the calcium cause I said man I'm taking all this stuff and uh there was a study that was on the news where they say calcium really doesn't do that much good and I'm saying, you know the calcium pills.
DOCTOR: Right [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm saying oh my goodness.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: For 40 years I been taking calcium and it's not doing any good.
DOCTOR: Right.  Well let me take a look see here.  So it looks like you have good kidney function.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So that's a good thing.  Uh.
PATIENT: Probably another thing something I want to make sure that my uh, I'm having problems getting my cholesterol medication because the last time it was just, the prescription was renewed for just 30 days.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  So you need a longer prescription on it.
PATIENT: Yeah cause at the Women's Clinic they initially renewed it every 90 days but then I would go in and get my blood checked every six months.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So they just would give me a 90 day supply.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And it was uh where you can get three or four refills.
DOCTOR: Right okay, yeah I can put that in for that for you.  You do not feel like it's a urinary tract infection correct?  But you had one of those before?
PATIENT: Yeah they said I had one this summer.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They said that was probably one of the reasons I was feeling bad.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause I felt bad all summer.
DOCTOR: Let's uh go ahead and get another urine sample from you today.  Um.
PATIENT: Do you know if Lipitor is better than the statin?  Is Lipitor a statin?
DOCTOR: Yeah, it sure is.
PATIENT: Somebody told me that uh the Lipitor doesn't cause the muscle problems.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: Or something that the side effects is not as bad with Lipitor as with uh Zocor.
DOCTOR: Oh, [REDACTED] yeah.
PATIENT: Have you had that or anything?
DOCTOR: Uh you're talking about the muscle problems?
PATIENT: Yeah uh the side effects.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I actually don't know.  I'm gonna have to talk my attending about it.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I been taking that a long time.  I can't seem to get my cholesterol down and I eat healthy but I do go overboard.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.
PATIENT: With all the exercise I do, I mean I do two or three hours of exercises a day for about three or four days a week, sometimes five, sometimes six.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I say man, I try to mix it up, I go walking, I ride my bike, stationary, I do yoga, I do cardio swim now, I do another exercise tape.  I do all kinds of stretches.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let's do this, let me go DOCTOR know about you okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we'll go from there.  I'll be right back in just a minute.
PATIENT: Okay, okay, thank you.
(DOCTOR OUT:  102:3  DOCTOR IN:  107:20)
DOCTOR: Alright now, so a couple of things.  We just want you to give a urine sample.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: To make sure there's nothing going on with your bladder that um also cause you're kind of having some tenderness in your belly kind of in funny places so we'd like to check some labs on you um and go from there.  Um this is happening kind of intermittently in the last several weeks is that right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But the first time was about a month ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So if this worsens at all, don't hesitate to come back here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If they can’t get you in here, you can come to the ER.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um and if the labs are normal, we might just have to pursue some imaging okay but uh like a CAT scan or something.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I don't think we need to go that far, I think just like I think the urine is kind of where the money is.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um especially cause you had the you know some infection this summer so um I think we'll start there um and go from there.  Then we'll have you follow up in the Women's Health Clinic as well, just to kind of set you up with your routine screenings.
PATIENT: Okay.  And what do you think about switching things [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay let me take a look see.
PATIENT: It's hard.
DOCTOR: That's right.
PATIENT: It's right here.
DOCTOR: Now did you say is it painful?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: It doesn't hurt.
PATIENT: No it's just hard.
DOCTOR: Got it, okay.
PATIENT: That came about four months ago and this one bout a month ago here.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had this problem before [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: No and I got a ring worm too.  I put some uh.
DOCTOR: Some cream on there?
PATIENT: Yeah I put some hydrochloride or something.
DOCTOR: Okay got it.
PATIENT: I got it from a hotel I'm sure.
DOCTOR: You did okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah, alright.  Do you want some terbinafine cream?  Is that.
PATIENT: I got some.
DOCTOR: Is the cream working?
PATIENT: Yeah it's working.
DOCTOR: It's working okay good.
PATIENT: Yeah I did make up some soda and Vaseline but then I went and bought some.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Cause it could be the beginnings of, they call it the Morgan Freeman spots.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It could be that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um if you have, I think there's a fancy name for it but everybody knows it as the Morgan Freeman [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay well it you don't think that is anything to worry about.
DOCTOR: No, I absolutely, nothing like [REDACTED] not cancer.
PATIENT: Yeah it's just; yeah it just looked like a bread crumb.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And I [REDACTED] you know when someone tells me to wipe my mouth.
DOCTOR: If they get worse or like if there's new ones that are popping up or if they become painful.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just let us know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay and we'll get you back in and we can send you to Dermatology.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Great, alright, thank you.
DOCTOR: Very good.  Alright, this is what we're gonna do.
PATIENT: So what am I gonna, so don't forget the cholesterol stuff.
DOCTOR: Yeah so look okay, I'll put in all the refills for everything and yeah we'll extend it out so that you can get like.
PATIENT: Yeah all I have to do is call it in and get it.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: On the phone.
DOCTOR: Uh what I could do too is I'll put in all the lab work for you to make sure you're not having any problems, so just stop by the Lab.
PATIENT: Oh you know what I might be able to do that now, I mean.   What do you want me to do now?
DOCTOR: Oh just some blood and then urine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's the only thing and then you're done.
PATIENT: Okay.  What's your blood for?
DOCTOR: Uh blood is for your belly.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We want to make sure there's nothing going on.
PATIENT: So you don't think while you're at it that my cholesterol should be checked again or don't you?
DOCTOR: So here's the deal, you had.  Let me take a look here I wrote it down.
PATIENT: I think, I don't know when the last time I had it.  I think it was, may have been in June.
DOCTOR: Yeah we can do you in every year so you're not due for another like six months.
PATIENT: Oh okay, they were doing it every six months.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I'm happy with how things look with your cholesterol.
PATIENT: Okay, great, okay.
