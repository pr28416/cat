We don't even sleep in the same bedroom.  I sleep in the bedroom downstairs.
DOCTOR: Alright.  I'll be back in a second.  You have everything squared away.  This is the one thing I'm concerned about.  I'm gonna do one of two things.  Either I'm gonna have you come back in four weeks and have it checked and if it's still high start you on another medication for this okay or it'll be better and I won't.  But I'm seriously doubting that it's gonna get better.

PATIENT: Okay.  Okay, you okay?
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let me make a few changes.  This you get x-rays and the ultrasound and we'll try to get it done sometimes next week.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: All this is gonna get better.  I got a, I got a task master in this new girlfriend and if I'm gonna leave the house, that's where I'm going, she gonna want to know all of this.  She said I'm not gonna die on her.  My wife now, she don't care.  Uh I got to go where I'm loved doc.  I do.  But the thing is doc.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I be leaving, I'm not working, I'm going to go leave there where I've been 19 years and go someplace else and I'm still not working but I'm going to take up with a new lady.  I was trying to climb my way out of it through the Bible but the Bible say I can't do it.  It's a sin for me to lust after this girl because she's not my wife and the only way I can do away with my wife is to give her a divorce and I can only give her a divorce if she's unfaithful.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know if she's unfaithful or not.  I can, I can give false witness and just say she is but then that wouldn't be good for me.  I could be just lying.  I'd have to actually know if she's you know unfaithful in order to give her a certificate of divorce, that what the Bible said.  That's the only way I can get away from her is through adultery.  But that should be on both sides shouldn't it?
DOCTOR: It should.  I don't begin to understand Christianity but.
PATIENT: And you are?
DOCTOR: I’m Hindu.
PATIENT: Hindu?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: But religion is religion right?
PATIENT: Yeah, right.  We all believe that there's a supreme being.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: Hindu, isn't that an [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: No.  That's [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh voodoo.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Hindu [REDACTED]  I have to investigate, you know go more into it, [REDACTED].  But we all believe in a supreme being and that this world will end.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And we are all be judged in the end.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: So we're together on that.  Oh.  [REDACTED]  I can give her a certificate of divorce is she's unfaithful so I'm feeling like if I sin; if she's unfaithful then I can get a divorce.  If I'm unfaithful she can get a divorce.  Like I said, it’s [REDACTED]@ doc.  You know what I found out though in looking, I've always been um uh a late starter.  I started kindergarten a whole year.
DOCTOR: Late.
PATIENT: Late right so I've always been -  things, things have always been late to me so this just might be what this is.  I look at horoscopes and I don't really go along with it, but I will read it and it says that the universe is trying to tell me something.  And I look because I hadn't seen her in 30 years and I find, she find me, her daughter find me on Facebook.  Her daughter was 7 years old when we were together and she's 36 now. She says she's in love with me and please come over.  Cause you know when we were going together at that time, she got raped.
DOCTOR: Really.  Who got raped?
PATIENT: The girl that I'm talking about.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: Three guys raped her.  She was out at a disco one night and three guys raped her but she showed up over my house the next day and I think I'd did what any man should do, I gave her my bedroom, my bed and I took care of her until she was up and well and she was mental enough to get up and get around I took her shopping and spent about $500 on her for new clothes and took all those old clothes she had and burned them and her and her daughter lived with me for a while until she got on her feet and I felt that any righteous man was supposed to do that.
DOCTOR: Good for you.
PATIENT: It was a mother and a daughter that needed help.
DOCTOR: Alright buddy.
PATIENT: Alright doc.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah until I get downstairs.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh I got to get the labs today?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: 4 o'clock?
DOCTOR: You can get all the labs while you're here but [REDACTED].  Okay.  Now get the labs, then go pick up the meds, they should be ready for you.
PATIENT: I'll check in on the meds then go to the other things.
DOCTOR: You want them to do them right here?
PATIENT: Here, [REDACTED] vampire.  yeah I do that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  We need urine from you.  You gonna do all that up here?
PATIENT: Uh it depends.  What type of urine.
DOCTOR: It might be better if you go downstairs.  You see I ordered a bunch of stuff downstairs.
PATIENT: Oh okay, let me go downstairs.
DOCTOR: Go downstairs.
PATIENT: Cause I got to make a stop and travel.  Oh the last time I went to travel uh they did have, they ran out of money.  Alright doc.
DOCTOR: See you later PATIENT.
PATIENT: Yes sir.
PATIENT: 52:14.
