DOCTOR: You don't think so?
PATIENT: No yeah [REDACTED] to it.  Uh uh, it's supposed to make you dizzy?
DOCTOR: Is it supposed to?  No.  I'm just worried, I'm just wondering if it ever drops your blood pressure too low.
PATIENT: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
DOCTOR: And it might not.  This might be a perfect regimen for you to be on these three pills.  Cause it looks like your blood pressure is a lot better.
PATIENT: Yeah but sometimes I'd have to say no.  I've been [REDACTED] for the last, every [REDACTED] exercise more [REDACTED].  I haven't been stressed out.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: I just try to take one of those.
DOCTOR: You can take it, so that medicine hydralazine only lasts for a few hours.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: To lower your blood pressure.  It's one of those that if you're not controlled on these two medicines then sometimes we add, we just take twice a day each pill like I'd say lasts for about 6-7 hours okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But if you take one in the morning you know and you take one in the afternoon.  Do you ever check your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: And what does it usually run?
PATIENT: Uh 140 over sometimes 79, 82.
DOCTOR: Like 140?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so you can take this probably in the afternoon okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So take it twice a day so once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  You probably have a lot of it, the hydralazine.
PATIENT: Okay what was the date 1/15?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  That's if you took this in the morning probably.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I had.
DOCTOR: So it lasts for about 6-7 hours.
PATIENT: I see, but yeah that's as long as I get no pain.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's good.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Because this is blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yeah I just get, if I lose some weight I don't need all those pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I need some uh.
DOCTOR: So if you lose a lot of weight then maybe we can get rid of the hydralazine okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I need acetaminophen.
DOCTOR: Acetaminophen?  Let's see you've got three refills on that so we'll just refill it today.
PATIENT: Okay that's good.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright.  I think that does it for the meds.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I'm kind of ticked out with my tests [REDACTED].  Like I said I went to the gym, last Thursday I weighed 278 and then I weighed myself again on Friday 277 so I see myself going down again.  You know I don't want to be too pissed off with myself so.
DOCTOR: Well you're doing good, okay.  Keep it up.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I was 293.
DOCTOR: So it's kind of like yeah.  That's good that you've lost yeah.  Your labs look good so your blood counts look good they look normal.  Your prostate test that we checked last time was normal okay.
PATIENT: Okay that's good.
DOCTOR: Um and then we'll check these other blood tests because we want to make sure you don't have another reason to have high blood pressure and it was normal too.

DOCTOR: Do you know roughly how long ago you were on that medicine?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I don't even know.
DOCTOR: Okay so a number of years ago.
PATIENT: Yeah it's been a couple of years ago.  That's a blood thinner right?
DOCTOR: No metoprolol is actually a medicine, when did you have your heart attack?  In 2000?  Around there?
PATIENT: Yeah something like that yeah that's it.  And I think I was on, they put me on metoprolol then I think.  What's the blood thinner they had me on?
DOCTOR: You might have been, were you on Warfarin or anything like that?  Heparin?
PATIENT: Uh uh, I was on metoprolol.
DOCTOR: I'm looking back so let's see you were on metoprolol in July of 2000.  So we'll see what was going on then.  Okay.  Okay so you were also on Plavix.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what I was trying to think of, Plavix.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  How long, you were probably on Plavix for a year or so.
PATIENT: Yeah that one, I think I was on metoprolol at the same time.
DOCTOR: Yeah you were on them together, so let's see when they took you off.  It looks like you're still on metoprolol in 2001, in 2002; you were still on metoprolol in 2003 so.
PATIENT: And I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Let's see in 2004 you were still on it and let's see 2005 you were still on it.  You were on it for a long time.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Looks like so the Plavix you were still on in 2005 too.  Even in 2008 you were on the metoprolol but you weren't on the Plavix then.  Let's see what it says.
PATIENT: Now why did they take me off the metoprolol?  Seems like the metoprolol gave me [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So you were on the metoprolol for a long time.
PATIENT: About 8 years?
DOCTOR: At least so up to 2009 I think you were still on it.
PATIENT: Well [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: In 2011 you were still on it.  So why did this get discontinued in 2011?  January [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It was DOCTOR
DOCTOR: Yeah DOCTOR.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Maybe I couldn't get along with it.
DOCTOR: So it looks like you got a stress test done, 2011, do you remember that?
PATIENT: Uh yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: We're cracking open the vault here.  Uh let's see.  I think DOCTOR took you off of it.  Do remember him?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Skinny guy.  Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I took his place.
PATIENT: Oh yeah I think, well it seemed like I was getting a doctor every six months.
DOCTOR: Yeah we switched, me and DOCTOR.  He went to Houston.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: That's where I'm from.
PATIENT: Oh.  I don't know if he's been [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What were doing [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Uh I seemed to have a family reunion down there.  I was in Houston in a place called Sugarland.
DOCTOR: Oh that's where my family lives.
PATIENT: Oh they do?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I was just.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's where [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: On the bay.
PATIENT: The [REDACTED].  It's hot down there, pretty hot.
DOCTOR: Oh was it really hot?
PATIENT: Hot, hot, hot.  It was so hot I was in the hotel and when I go outside my glasses would get fogged up boom.  Just like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You were glad to come back to Chicago?
PATIENT: It was hot here too though.  Yeah it was still [REDACTED], Sugarland, Texas, thatâ€™s the first time I heard of Sugarland.
DOCTOR: Yeah people think I'm making it up when I say I'm from Sugarland.
PATIENT: No it's a real city, it's real.
DOCTOR: It's a real city.
PATIENT: It's real.  There was a nice little place, [REDACTED] little stores and malls.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Little slot machines, within walking distance of everything.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's a nice little suburb.
PATIENT: Yeah sort of [REDACTED] with Houston.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They had good food.
DOCTOR: Okay so I think I cracked the mystery.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So do you think around the time that you had your heart attack did you use any kind of drug whatsoever back then?  It was a long time ago so you may not remember.
PATIENT: Uh 2011.
DOCTOR: It was 2000.
PATIENT: 2000 oh yes I was kind of back on drugs then.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] cocaine?
PATIENT: 2011 you say?
DOCTOR: In 2000.
PATIENT: Oh 2000.
DOCTOR: A long time ago.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You might have been using cocaine or something like that?
PATIENT: I could've yeah.
DOCTOR: Could be right so I think why they took you off of that is because I think when they did your stress test.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: They didn't see anything with your heart that would predispose you like this just showed that you had a heart attack that caused a lot of damage.
PATIENT: Alright cause I stopped doing some of the things I was doing.
DOCTOR: Yeah so it got better though.
PATIENT: Yeah it did.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: I stopped a whole lot of things.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I think that maybe what could've caused is maybe some cocaine.  Sometimes this causes what they call a spasm in the heart.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: It's called a spasm and it looks exactly like a heart attack and it feels exactly like a heart attack and it is.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: So people get a lot of recovery time.
PATIENT: Yeah but what's, I've been, okay I been still having an [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I was in the hospital and uh they said I had a heart attack, I had a walking heart attack and wondered if I'd used cocaine but I couldn't use no cocaine cause I was in the hospital.  I had been in the hospital about 2-3 weeks.
DOCTOR: Oh [REDACTED] time.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Oh come on get in the wheelchair. Wheelchair for what? [REDACTED] heart attack.  [REDACTED] that's what I'm saying.  So [REDACTED].  I had to stay in Intensive Care for a long week.  I think my high blood pressure had a lot to do with [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay good.
PATIENT: I think the high blood pressure got something to do with [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  What [REDACTED] Viet Nam?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Oh you were right.
PATIENT: So I guess got PTSD cause I got PTSD.
DOCTOR: Yeah.

DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I stayed there from December 68 till March 1970.  I know something once you [REDACTED] wound up being there [REDACTED] now they tell me.

DOCTOR: So do you have the other one covering your nose and mouth?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Just your nose?
PATIENT: My nose and mouth.
DOCTOR: Do you want to try the one with just your nose?  Cause what we could do is they could send you to the Sleep Clinic and they can try one that might be a little bit more comfortable.
PATIENT: I would, I ain't got time to go to the clinic.
DOCTOR: Sleep Clinic.
PATIENT: I don't have time in my schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The sleep study you got to stay all night and everything, no, no, no.
DOCTOR: Okay I'm sure you've heard this before but the CPAP will help you lose weight.  I know it sounds crazy but it'll help you lose weight.
PATIENT: How will it do that?  You explain that and I may just consider it, how does it do that?
DOCTOR: Okay I'll give you a whole handout on the benefits of the CPAP okay.  Let me talk to DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Yeah I don't believe that.  I only lose weight with exercise.
DOCTOR: Okay.
DOCTOR: 45:15   DOCTOR IN:  51:53
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you met DOCTOR?  He took DOCTOR's place.  You met DOCTOR right?
PATIENT: I can't tell.  Okay now you were talking about the CPAP now I'll be honest.
DOCTOR: Let's look at those.
PATIENT: I mean do I have to do a whole new CPAP right?
DOCTOR: Oh you would?
PATIENT: Yeah cause I have the dinosaur CPAP.  I got it in the 90s when I first got that CPAP.  I said I'd use it [REDACTED].  And it's old really.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Cardiovascular [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh what?
DOCTOR: Those are the [REDACTED] the sleep apnea does.  I'll go over with you.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  You stop breathing sometimes.  It can increase your blood pressure but you're already on medicine.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But youâ€™re already on medicine [REDACTED], hypertension.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh good.  It's even supposed to give you more energy during the day.
PATIENT: Use it at night and energy in the day huh?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Yeah.  [REDACTED].  You have to sleep with it over your head all strapped and that's not comfortable.
DOCTOR: So maintain average use of the CPAP is four hours [REDACTED] pretty rested [REDACTED].  These are benefits.  So anytime you feel like maybe you want to exchange your dinosaur CPAP machine and try a new one and see if maybe the new ones like, I don't know I've never used a CPAP but I imagine it's really uncomfortable.  Maybe the new ones are a little bit better I don't know.
PATIENT: I've used it; if I only lose the weight then I don't have no sleep apnea.
DOCTOR: Yeah so, the good thing is to lose the weight.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah so I'll work on that.
DOCTOR: It'll help with your blood pressure; it'll help with your cardiovascular disease okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I want to lose the weight so then they'll take me off.
DOCTOR: Motivate yourself.
PATIENT: Yeah, like I say if I lose weight with motivation I can get a whole lot of [REDACTED] especially with a trainer he's got me doing something different and everything for my body gonna get used to that.  When he changes I say okay, like trying new food you know when I want a side of fries, trying to [REDACTED] food and everything.  Do you know what a [REDACTED] is?  [REDACTED].
