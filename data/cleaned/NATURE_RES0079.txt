Is there anything that I'm missing?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers all the symptoms.
DOCTOR: And you might have potentially had, some exposure through your girlfriend potentially, so it's possible that, well, it's possible that you just have a cold, but it's also,  we'll still have to rule out covid as a cause, and so we'll have to do a covid swab and go from there and we'll check your temperature here as well. Just, uh, I think something that I forgot to ask, have you taken any medications that has helped you with your symptoms?
PATIENT: Uh no, I haven't taken anything.
DOCTOR: OK, alright, well, thank you, I'll go talk to my attending and we'll come back and discuss this further with you.
PATIENT: That sounds great. Thank you.
