DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Stuff like that I can't and I been having trouble breathing lately.
DOCTOR: When?
PATIENT: When it got real hot man, that stuff.  The air was on, it just felt like it didn't work or these pumps that I'd been taking felt like it didn't work and I'd catch myself not breathing.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I could be watching TV.
DOCTOR: And right now you're taking the Advair?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You take it twice a day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then you have the albuterol that you just take as needed.
PATIENT: That's stuff [REDACTED] and that pump, I think that pump needs to be upgraded.
DOCTOR: The albuterol?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It only comes in one strength uh when are you, like when are you noticing the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Well I notice it about 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay you get short of breath.
PATIENT: I have to get up, it's like I stop breathing and I got to get up and grab that pump.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Do you feel very anxious when this is going on?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright um and you get, have you ever been on any other medications for your asthma?  Um.

DOCTOR: Alright.  Have you noticed it feels like you're moving more slowly?
PATIENT: Uh in the arms.
DOCTOR: In the arms?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How so?
PATIENT: Maybe I couldn't even move this one up the other day.  I could just move it up like this and it will start hurting.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Then I have to grab it and the muscle pushes back down.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Same thing with this arm and this rash, I don't know what, it just happened.  I don't know what that is.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: This came out of nowhere man.
DOCTOR: What are you talking about?
PATIENT: What is that?
DOCTOR: Oh this right here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It looks like just dry skin to me.  Does it itch?
PATIENT: No.  I've never itched it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um this to me um seems like the summertime okay.
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: I would just put some lotion on it.  Let me see your other elbow.
PATIENT: This is not like that.
DOCTOR: This one's not as bad um.  I would start with some lotion or like uh, do you use Vaseline or anything?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah start with that and if it gets worse um I want to see it but right now it looks okay.
PATIENT: You know I have never been tested for diabetes or cancer here.
DOCTOR: Or cancer so uh.
PATIENT: I've never been tested.
DOCTOR: Right so we'll get to that.  Um do you have any feelings of hurting yourself?
PATIENT: Uh not hurting myself but hurting other people sometimes.
DOCTOR: When is that?
PATIENT: Oh that's been happening this week, I mean this year.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Period. I get frustrated man, I get frustrated.  I'm not listening good to other people.  They're like [REDACTED].  My feelings is very short.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Um so a couple of things going on here.  First off uh you sound depressed to me okay.  You sound very depressed.  You have, we have uh kind of an eight point screening test for depression um and usually you're positive on 2-3 of them um that's when we consider someone to be likely depressed um.  You're currently positive on six of them so you know it sounds like you're dealing with some depression right now.  Can you think of any reason you would be depressed?
PATIENT: Well my mother and father, they was in the hospital not too long ago and I been dealing with that, I don't know.  I know and so were all my other brothers.  They have families and I was dealing with this by myself.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Do either of your parents live with you?
PATIENT: They, both of them does.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah both of them are sick.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: One has Parkinson's and cancer and my mother's sick.  She has depression.  She gets bouts of depression.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She's taking Xanax, Zoloft and all this stuff and it's making me that way too man.  I know I can't deal with it all, I don't know what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I can definitely understand your frustration with that situation.  It sounds like you've got quite a bit on your plate right now.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Uh the other thing that you mentioned, the black stools.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um so when people have black stools the thing we would be concerned about is that you're possibly bleeding somewhere in your GI tract.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Now if uh, if it resolved then you're probably not bleeding anymore.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Uh and it doesn't, just because they were black doesn't mean that you were bleeding um.  The other thing that can sometimes make your stool black is Pepto Bismol if you take the medication.  If you're taking Pepto Bismol it'll also be black or iron supplements but I don't think you're taking that.
PATIENT: The only thing I did, I took some of my mother's omeprazole.
DOCTOR: Omeprazole?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I thought you were already on omeprazole?
PATIENT: Iâ€™m out of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay so first off we can refill that for sure um but no, omeprazole shouldn't make your stool black.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: That was for the pain I was having all day, around the chest heart area, through the stomach area, a pain, just pain that come out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh if you're having pain in your chest, you know you may want to consider going to the Emergency Room.
PATIENT: That's what the lady told me already.
DOCTOR: Right but you didn't go to the Emergency Room?
PATIENT: I have two elderly people to uh.
DOCTOR: Right, alright.
PATIENT: Take care of.
DOCTOR: I can understand that um.  The main concern though is if you have a heart attack you know it doesn't matter who you have to take care of cause you're not gonna be there anymore.  Well the other that you bring up is uh screening tests for cancer and diabetes um.  You are correct; uh you know I don't think we've ever screened you for diabetes um. Previously there really wasn't any indication for you to be screened for diabetes.  You know you weren't that heavy and you seemed like you were doing well um.  In light of your recent weight gain um you know sometimes that can be related.  I would like to screen you for diabetes um.  The other thing we need to check is your lipids, your cholesterol needs to be rechecked um because we haven't checked them in a while.  Um and then as far as cancer screening uh there's only really two cancers that we screen for, um, because when you screen for cancer it has to be common to pick anything up and it has to be deadly.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So things that we're concerned about are prostate cancer and colon cancer.
PATIENT: Okay colon cancer.
DOCTOR: Colon cancer, you had the colonoscopy so you'll be and you did um some polyps on there, um.  It was done in 2009 so you'll need a repeat in 2014.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You might need one five years after that because of the polyps.
PATIENT: So what happens with the repeat?
DOCTOR: When you have polyps?
PATIENT: I had two of them that were pre-cancer they told me.
DOCTOR: Right.  So the uh your polyps, there's a bunch of different kinds of polyps um.  Your polyps were the less scary kind so they very infrequently turn into cancer.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So we want you to, normally people get screened every ten years.  You had polyps so they want to screen you every five.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh polyps take a while to turn into cancer.  It's not like you're gonna get one today and a month from now it's gonna be cancer.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So if there were only two then, screening you again in five years there may be more polyps but it's unlikely that there would be an actual cancer.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um the other thing, prostate cancer um.  Prostate cancer is very common but it's usually not very deadly.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um do you have difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: No, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Now can you sleep through the night without getting up to go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Uh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So in someone who doesn't have any symptoms and do you have a family history of prostate cancer?
PATIENT: Uh my father had testicular cancer.
DOCTOR: Testicular cancer?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh when did your dad develop testicular cancer?
PATIENT: Oo uh two years ago.  Uh he's cancer free as they say right now.
DOCTOR: Excellent, excellent.  Do you know how to check yourself for testicular cancer?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay all you need to do is feel your testicles and if you feel any hard bumps that's what we'd be concerned about.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So a bump like a pea, if it felt like a pea and it'll be hard.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's when you would want to see someone.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Uh if you're not having any symptoms and you're not, there's no family history of prostate cancer um the screening test that we have sometimes causes as much problems as they do good because if the screening test is positive then we're gonna want to do a biopsy.  Um biopsies can cause erectile dysfunction.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Incontinence, so my recommendation would be that you don't get screened.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  If you want to be screened that's fine but uh I don't think it's a good idea.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright.  We have a lot of things to address today.  Um I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR.  Do you have more questions?
PATIENT: No just the medicines.  The omeprazole.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You have all the stuff you need refilled.
PATIENT: So I can pick it up, thatâ€™s why I brought the bag.
DOCTOR: Sure.  Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Let me go talk to DOCTOR, I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  41:36  DOCTOR IN:  48:20)
DOCTOR: Alright.  So let's go one by one and get these things taken care of.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So first off um based on the symptoms that you're having um you meet the criteria for what's called a major depressive episode.  Um there's a reason, you have an inciting incident that would explain why you're depressed.  You know you have a lot going on with your parents right now um but it's affecting you quite a bit from what you're telling me.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I would recommend treating you um with a medication.  Um it's one of the medications in the class called uh selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and what that means is it increases the amount of serotonin in your brain and serotonin is a chemical that makes us feel better.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so along the studies have shown that um compared to just giving medication or just having people talk to a therapist the best method is to do both.  You get the best results when you take medication and you talk to someone.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Is that something you would be open to?
PATIENT: Yes, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay so then you know I think the best thing would be to start a medication and to have you see um a therapist.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um the other thing is in the few weeks right after you start one of these medications, sometimes you're gonna take them 3-4 weeks before you get the full effect of the medication.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: In the first few weeks sometimes people have increased feelings of suicide so if that's something that you notice to be happening to you then you would want to uh probably talk, go find some help, go to the ER or something because you know that's obviously very serious okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Um second, I can refill all of your medications.  Do you know which ones you need refills on?
PATIENT: Omeprazole.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh hydrochlorothiazide.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh wow, all that's run it on the screen.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause basically all of them.
DOCTOR: Do you pick them up here or do you get them?
PATIENT: I can pick them up here today.
DOCTOR: Okay so I'll make sure that you have refills on everything and you can pick them up at the window.
PATIENT: Thatâ€™s a lot of them.
DOCTOR: Yeah I got them all in my note from the last time I saw you.  So you take the Docusate to help, it's a stool softener.
PATIENT: I don't need those.
DOCTOR: You don't need that okay um but the Advair, it's the inhaler.
PATIENT: Yeah I think I ordered it already. I think itâ€™s the 10 or 12, see that's the problem.  Some of those are about to expire anyway.
DOCTOR: So the ones that are about to expire I can add refills onto them.
PATIENT: Okay, alright.
DOCTOR: Would you rather have those delivered to your house or pick them up here?
PATIENT: I can pick some up today.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and then the hydrochlorothiazide you said you need.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Are you taking any of the stool softeners like the Lactulose or the hemorrhoid suppository?
PATIENT: I'm taking the poly um.
DOCTOR: The polyethylene glycol?
PATIENT: The big white bottle.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah I'm taking that.  That helps, man that lactose stuff, is that?
DOCTOR: Lactulose okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That big white one I take that one and that makes me use the washroom.
DOCTOR: The metoprolol, that's the other blood pressure one.
PATIENT: Metoprolol yeah I take that.
DOCTOR: Okay, do you need more of that?
PATIENT: Yeah I'm running out of that too.
DOCTOR: Alright and then simvastatin, the one for your cholesterol.
PATIENT: Oh yeah I take that.
DOCTOR: Okay and then you said you need more of the omeprazole.
PATIENT: Asmanex I've run out completely, omeprazole I've run out completely.
DOCTOR: Alright so we'll get those all refilled for you.
PATIENT: What else, omeprazole, Asmanex, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol.  That's about it yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'll get them all refilled uh.
PATIENT: So which ones can I pick up over there?
DOCTOR: Which ones did you need to pick, I mean I can make it so you can pick them all up over there.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'll pick them all up today.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.
PATIENT: I don't have nothing to do.
DOCTOR: We can do that.  Um and then uh I want to add another medication for your asthma.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Itâ€™s called tiotropium or Spiriva.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Uh you know if you're still having a lot of symptoms.
PATIENT: That's when I have the wheezing, I take them here to here.
DOCTOR: Okay and this will be uh you know you have the asthma medications that you take every day; this will be one of those.  The albuterol is the only asthma medication that you take when you actually have symptoms.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: All the other ones are controller medications that you'll take every day no matter what.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: And that's what this one will be too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh and when is the last time you've eaten?
PATIENT: Oh this morning.

DOCTOR: 10 o'clock okay so about five hours ago.
