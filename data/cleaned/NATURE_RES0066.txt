PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: OK. Yeah, so is there anything else? Any other questions that you have for me today?
PATIENT: No, what do you think I have?
DOCTOR: Yeah, so there's definitely multiple things that can be going on. Since you were just recently admitted, maybe you might have another bacterial r espiratory infection, like a pneumonia or it could be viral as well. So the first thing we want to do is for sure get COVID swab done and then we will also get, since you were admitted, as well recently, we want to get an X Ray on you just to see if there's any pneumonia. OK, and so we'll be keeping you here for a bit until everything comes back. We'll get some blood work done for you as well to see if there's any infection in your body. And then yeah, so just sit tight, we'll get all those things done. Is that OK with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's great. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, yeah. So well will be updating you shortly.
PATIENT: OK, great, thank you.
