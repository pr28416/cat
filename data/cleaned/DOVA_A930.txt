PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
I'm his life partner.  Nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: Hi, alright so I was pretty sure you’re new but I think it's always a good idea when people bring other people with them to appointments.
SECOND PERSON A930
I just don't let him go anywhere by himself.
DOCTOR: That way she can tattle on you.
SECOND PERSON A930
(Laughter).
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON A930
No this way he can't lie to me.

DOCTOR: Nothing?  Alright.
SECOND PERSON A930
They've been working on his lungs now.  I guess they're thoracic or whatever was talking about um.
PATIENT: They found a new spot on my lungs.

DOCTOR: Remember both taps right?  And you have bilateral pulmonary nodules correct?
PATIENT: In my lungs yeah.
SECOND PERSON A930

SECOND PERSON A930

DOCTOR: And what are they planning on doing?
PATIENT: Well they want to go in on the new module.
SECOND PERSON A930
Nodule.
PATIENT: That they found, they want to go in and take a biopsy of it I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So that’s a little nerve-wracking, huh?
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yes I may lose [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
One, two day procedure could be a five to seven day depending on what gets found out and stuff.
DOCTOR: Oh you mean how long he's going to be in the hospital and what not.
SECOND PERSON A930
Right.  I have a question so when he was in, about two weeks ago he came in for a um Urology consult.
DOCTOR: Yes.
SECOND PERSON A930
And they were going to take; well they did take a sample of the urine and everything.  Did anything come back with that, I mean anything abnormal or?
PATIENT: Well they were supposed to send it off because it came through the [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Right I know that's why I'm wondering if they found anything.
DOCTOR: Well I don't see any urine in here.  I don't see it.  Let me read their notes.  Cause you just saw them on the 10th.
SECOND PERSON A930
Correct.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Don't do that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: This is not good for me.  Um oh okay, so they did a cystoscopy it looks like.  That's how [REDACTED] Cytology so I'll check that.  There we go.  So it says um there are some cell abnormalities um and rare atypical cells and some regular just plain cells suggestive of a type of virus.  It doesn't say anything specifically about any sort of cancer.
SECOND PERSON A930
Hmm.
DOCTOR: I don't think it's a completely normal result.
SECOND PERSON A930
Right.
DOCTOR: But I'm not a urologist, I don't know exactly.
SECOND PERSON A930
Well I know they've got a follow-up, I think it's March 5th or something for him to go back again so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
I was just wondering you know what they'd found or.
DOCTOR: Yeah definitely they did not see any positive for malignancy there so.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
What other questions?
PATIENT: Huh question.
DOCTOR: You can put that on the table if you want to if that makes it easier.  So uh you have Cardiology to get clearance today.
SECOND PERSON A930
Hmm.
DOCTOR: When are your test going to be?
PATIENT: I have no idea.
DOCTOR: You haven't had it scheduled yet?
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON A930
They're waiting until all the [REDACTED] on this.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just out of curiosity um I had a form and somebody sent a form in for diabetic shoes but somebody said that I haven't been in here for two years and I have to come in you know before they can sign it.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And I was seen every three months ago.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Somebody said that I haven't been here in two years and I just kind of wonder where they got that information now.
DOCTOR: You know what I think it is is that you haven't been to see a primary care doctor in quite some time.
SECOND PERSON A930
Right.
PATIENT: I don't think I've ever seen a primary care doctor that I know of.
DOCTOR: Well.
SECOND PERSON A930
[REDACTED] DOCTOR either moved on or.
PATIENT: Oh I'm not sure they were primary doctors.
DOCTOR: The last time I saw you was in June.  You were supposed to be patient of [REDACTED] DOCTOR but I believe that I had seen you once before because you were, yeah cause I covered her clinics when she was on maternity leave.  Since I have, at this point, seen you twice and she had never seen you, I just kind of put you in my clinic cause there really was no point in you establishing with her again.  Especially since her residents [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Right.
DOCTOR: So that's what it comes down to.  Um so they said that you had to come in and be seen for that paperwork right?
PATIENT: Yeah um.
DOCTOR: Alright, [REDACTED] I’ll tell them I’m seeing  you.  [REDACTED] for some reason did not have you fully established.
SECOND PERSON A930
Right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Nobody has seen me huh?
DOCTOR: No they didn't.
SECOND PERSON A930
I want you, dear.
PATIENT: You have to.
DOCTOR: You’ve been following up with Onc. [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Cause it's just never been one particular.
DOCTOR: Right, no that's fine.
SECOND PERSON A930
Like you know if we had a question or something there's never been anybody who we could really call because they say well who's your doctor and it's like okay we don't know.
PATIENT: What time of a day is yeah.
DOCTOR: So I’m trying to find where they had this message is from. They sent me a message. [REDACTED] hidden behind things.  Do you have that paperwork with you on the shoes with you?
PATIENT: What paperwork do you need?
DOCTOR: For the diabetic shoes.
SECOND PERSON A930
No.
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON A930
That's one piece of paper I didn't bring with.
PATIENT: Well that's got nothing to do with the VA though that's medicaid.
DOCTOR: Let me see if at home I have it in my files because when you had the first visit and then you haven't seen somebody in a while they probably wanted him checked.
SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah for the neuropathy and all that.
DOCTOR: Sure now what do you need, do you need to get a prescription?
PATIENT: Uh, I guess we need permission to get the shoes uh.
SECOND PERSON A930
But what do you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I got some medical supplier [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Oh for your medical supplier?
DOCTOR: Okay so you need [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's got nothing to do with you know the VA.
DOCTOR: The VA okay.
PATIENT: But they asked who the primary doctor I saw and that's where they got the VA.
DOCTOR: And they asked where your primary doctor was okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So let me look through there um and I can reach you at PHONE NUMBER?
PATIENT: Most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay even if you just have a number for the supplier, I could maybe just call them and have them fax it to me.
SECOND PERSON A930
I think we've got it at home, that I do know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON A930
The regular number.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I think I told you [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um okay so we want in because you were having this weight loss and I think we need to kind of get him then followed um.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You’ve actually gained some weight it looks like [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Yeah I go by weight at home without you know clothes or anything like that, that adds about 15 pounds.
DOCTOR: So this is your weight trend over the last two years.  So you were about 158 in February 2009 then it went down and then it came back up and then it’s been relatively steady and he is actually up to about 150 now.  That's you know with our scale.
PATIENT: Well I [REDACTED] weighed me fully clothed.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you should be in theory fully-clothed every time you take your weight here so.
PATIENT: Okay but that's you know.
DOCTOR: We're going to follow your trends here.  I'm not saying that that's not concerning.  I think if you think you’re losing weight and um and with the lung nodules we should follow up on this [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well we saw the nutritionist [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
And anyhow she gave us all sorts of ideas for.
DOCTOR: Good.
SECOND PERSON A930
You know shakes and smoothies and things that you know.
DOCTOR: To gain weight.
SECOND PERSON A930
And things that you know.  His biggest thing is, you know you can have anything in front of you but if you are not hungry, you can't force yourself to eat, I don't care you know, I wish that was my problem but it's not.
DOCTOR: Me too.
SECOND PERSON A930
But um you know and I mean she gave us some really good ideas and you know peanut butter and graham crackers and you know on the one hand the things could definitely put the weight on him but then on the other hand.
PATIENT: Being diabetic it's kind of hard.
SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah you know so it's, it is hard to balance it out.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
Kind of like I said its one thing if you are hungry, but he just has I mean no appetite.
PATIENT: I don't think there's a magic pill to cure that.
SECOND PERSON A930
And maybe there's not, I have to tell people that.  Because when I say he has no appetite they look at me like.
DOCTOR: Are you serious?
SECOND PERSON A930
Yes I am.
PATIENT: Try McDonald’s, yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  I don't expect him to be the [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Thank you.
DOCTOR: So um.
SECOND PERSON A930
We have a 7 pound Yorkshire terrier, Yorkie at home that I swear eats more than he does.  Right?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Yes he does.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I have a little yippy dog, I have a 7 pound um Maltese.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay I know what they look like.
DOCTOR: Pretty little [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah but you know you can't live with them but you can't live without them either.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know.
PATIENT: Well we’re going to try, if he doesn’t change.
DOCTOR: I know, I’m obsessed with him.  Alright so um are you having any chest pain with walking around?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: About how far do you think you can walk?
PATIENT: Oh eight or nine steps most of the time uh I have no qualms about.  I haven't taking 20 mile hikes or anything you know but I'm.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
He gets lightheaded and dizzy if he gets up real fast um.  The pain when it was up here where, which I guess is where the nodule is or whatever.  It's still there, I can tell just by you know him putting his hand up there or whatever the case may be but um, to walk for any great length or anything like that uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
So [REDACTED] stuff like that.
DOCTOR: How long has that been going on?
PATIENT: The pain?
SECOND PERSON A930
[REDACTED] depends.
DOCTOR: Not being able to walk, seven steps is not very far.
PATIENT: No I was joking.
DOCTOR: You can walk here from the parking lot is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh you know I think the combination also is part of the diabetes because of the numbness.
DOCTOR: And tingling in the feet?
SECOND PERSON A930
And tingling in the feet and legs yeah.
DOCTOR: When did you last see podiatry.
PATIENT: Oh I had, they cut the toenail off at that time.
SECOND PERSON A930
That was last year.
PATIENT: I dropped something two years.
SECOND PERSON A930
Two years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we need to get you back in the Podiatry Clinic. These are the things that can wait until after the whole lung nodule thing, but I don't want you to [REDACTED] your diabetes um just because of that.  Um so I think a good thing to do would be to do - because your hemoglobin A1c was 8.8 [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Is that good, bad or indifferent?
DOCTOR: In June. It's not good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No it needs to be higher than that, I mean lower.
PATIENT: Lower, thank you.
DOCTOR: Um but your blood sugars look okay, they're not terrible.
SECOND PERSON A930
No but I have a question for you on that one.
DOCTOR: Sure.
SECOND PERSON A930
You know I [REDACTED] on the one hand with the eating and so on and forth okay and like the nutritionist was saying that you know yes we know diabetes is the concern but you know you also need to you know eat to keep your energy up and so on and so forth but his blood sugar lately cause he takes it every day okay.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON A930
He takes it in the morning and everything, it can range anywhere from let's say one day well you know 135-140 and it can go up to closes to 300.
DOCTOR: What's it in the morning?
SECOND PERSON A930
He only takes it once a day and it's in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay and it varies that much huh?
SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh it depends you know if I have a late night snack you know before I go to bed it's going to be higher the next morning.
DOCTOR: What's your dose of Glargine at night?
PATIENT: 30, 30 units.  So I think I got 28 but one doctor told me to go up to 30.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's what I've been taking.
DOCTOR: When did you go up to 30?
PATIENT: Oh about uh three months ago maybe.
DOCTOR: Do you take it with meals or just take it that one time a day?
PATIENT: Just one time a day.
DOCTOR: So I think we need to get you in to see the Pharm D to help manage your blood sugars because managing your blood sugars before you get the surgery is going to be important okay.
PATIENT: Uh I am wondering if I should go back to the, I'm on the slow-acting once a day insulin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So you can't really change it during the day.
DOCTOR: You can add to it, Lispro.
SECOND PERSON A930
Lispro?
DOCTOR: Lispro it's a short-acting insulin and that's usually what we do is recommend a long-acting as kind of a baseline.
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then the short-acting to be used with meals.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
PATIENT: Well I was led to believe that you couldn't mix the two.
DOCTOR: No you can.  Yeah there are two different types.
SECOND PERSON A930
I like that becuase I know sometimes it does depend on if he ate late you know the evening before or if he gets up in the morning and has a cookie or something.
DOCTOR: Do you ever feel a little shaky at night or shaky with low blood sugar?
PATIENT: I have once or twice, twice but I try to alleviate that by I guess cause one time I passed out.
DOCTOR: Were you having any chest pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: We probably should repeat your hemoglobin A1c today just to see what it is um the rest of your labs are really quite normal and then the only other thing is that I want to check um.
SECOND PERSON A930
Do they have lab draws for brain function?
DOCTOR: We don't.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: B-12.
SECOND PERSON A930
I had to throw that in there sorry.
PATIENT: After that behave.
DOCTOR: Now have you eaten this morning?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON A930
Cup of coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright then.
PATIENT: At 6:30 in the morning I'm not hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then how has your blood pressure been?
PATIENT: Uh not bad.
DOCTOR: Okay so you're taking the aspirin, the gabapentin, the insulin and everything we said.
PATIENT: Uh I just started taking aspirin again.
DOCTOR: Well they may tell you to stop that relatively soon for the surgery.  Lisinopril 40 daily right?
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Simvastatin okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
My voice is going out on me.  Simvastatin is that a derivative of Lipitor or?
DOCTOR: Yeah it's the same.
SECOND PERSON A930
Is it?  Okay.
DOCTOR: Same kind.  Alright so I think we need some labs today just to check your lipids.
PATIENT: As long it don't involve needles with that.
DOCTOR: There's no way to give blood without a needle.
PATIENT: Bite my lip.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] that might take longer and be more painful.  Um I know and then I wonder if we need to have you do some more diabetes education.  Do you know that you should be checking your blood sugars more often?
PATIENT: Well I was lead to believe that [REDACTED] that I've been using for about a year now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But there's not, again I was under the impression you couldn't take any supplemental.
DOCTOR: Right but you can check it different times and you can add [REDACTED] to your meal.  It sounds like you probably could go up on the Glargine even more.  So let's see what your hemoglobin A1c shows since it's been a while since you've had that.
PATIENT: Yeah, it's supposed to be what around 4 or 5.
DOCTOR: Your hemoglobin A1c?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Between 6 and 7.
PATIENT: Oh I thought it was.
DOCTOR: Your hemoglobin A1c it's not terrible but it's not good.  So that could be better and the reason why I'm so concerned about it now is because I want it to be as good as possible prior to your surgery.
SECOND PERSON A930
Right.
DOCTOR: Because how well your diabetes is controlled with [REDACTED] on how long you heal.  And diabetics already have a hard time healing from surgery.
SECOND PERSON A930
Right.
PATIENT: So yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And they know that I'm allergic to needles.
DOCTOR: Um [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Well we only [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I think you missed that.
SECOND PERSON A930
[REDACTED].  I'm going to give that to you but that's not [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: We're not going back there now.
SECOND PERSON A930
Oh I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in and out.  Breathe normal.  Where is your pain?
PATIENT: Uh if I have it's right underneath the ribs.
DOCTOR: Is it reproducible when you push there?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No it's inside.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: No you feel that it's inside, it doesn't hurt when I push or anything?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  Well it sounds like everything that needs to be  managed right now is, I would probably recommend that we get a Pharm D to help manage and titrate your meds.
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Because once we are able to get the under control then we can kind of continue you know care.  But they are very good at kind of adding things on.
PATIENT: She used to call about once a month and I haven't heard from her.
DOCTOR: You used to talk to the Pharm D?
SECOND PERSON A930
Yes they'd call him.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON A930
Once every two months, [REDACTED].  And that was more kind of how you doing um.
PATIENT: Yeah I got [REDACTED] up in the [REDACTED] but I haven't heard from her [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
No it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Now I don't see you for the visits, not even phone.
PATIENT: Yeah she used to call um I would say every six weeks or so.
SECOND PERSON A930
[REDACTED] three, four times [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Quite a while since she's called.  I had forgotten all about that.
SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah once she said [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay, a consult was put in in 2008.  Why don't you [REDACTED] cause I don't know if you need a new consult.  Do you know their phone number?
SECOND PERSON A930
The [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Yeah the pharmacist?
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Why don't you go ahead and give them a call.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: And get re-established with them.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: 8.8 really isn't good enough.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: You know.
SECOND PERSON A930
And that's something you don't [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um the, it's called the hemoglobin A1c is what we follow and it's basically like a report card of your blood sugar control for the last three months.
SECOND PERSON A930
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Sure.
SECOND PERSON A930
And that's what we want to tell her when we call.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I mean we're going to repeat it today and I'll titrate it up but I think it's going to be especially important because he's going to have surgery.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: Just have her.
SECOND PERSON A930
Hemoglobin A, what is it.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] A1-C?
DOCTOR: I'm sorry what?
SECOND PERSON A930
Hemoglobin A.
DOCTOR: A1c.
SECOND PERSON A930
I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: No that's okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay no that's okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah I wish I could, that would be nice.
SECOND PERSON A930
[REDACTED] nice.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: You know let me look at their last note cause I don't know.  I don't want to get so caught up in not being your health maintenance doctor because of the more active issues.  Yeah we're going to do um, uh let's see.  You had a colonoscopy in 2009 which was fine.
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh yes.
DOCTOR: You had the pneumo vaccination in 2003, tetanus done in 2002  and then um and have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh 12 or 13 years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you had a CT scan and that would have told us [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay so no aneurysms, so pretty much your screening is up-to-date alright.
PATIENT: You don't [REDACTED] that do you?
DOCTOR: No.  You're in the hospital system, there's nothing we can do about it.
SECOND PERSON A930
You can run but you can't hide.
DOCTOR: Sorry.
SECOND PERSON A930
No I'm glad you [REDACTED].
(DOCTOR OUT:  92:45  DOCTOR IN:  102:20)
DOCTOR: Where'd your wife go?  She leave you?
PATIENT: No, somebody [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: She [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um okay, so I'm going to put in for another Pharm D consult just to see, just in case you need a new one.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um [REDACTED].  When was the last time you saw an eye doctor?
PATIENT: Uh yeah I see him again February 3rd I think.
DOCTOR: Okay so you need to see Ophtho um, Podiatry you need to make a call to them okay and then you should probably call and make another appointment with the Hemoc Clinic too.
PATIENT: And what's that about?
DOCTOR: The Cancer Clinic, just because of the lung nodules, I think you have.
PATIENT: Yeah that was the whole reason.  There was one before when I had the original cancer 12 years ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But now another one's developed and that's the one they wanted to test to see if it is cancer.
DOCTOR: Yeah I just think that you probably should you know.
PATIENT: Well I just can't see being in the hospital for five days for that but.
DOCTOR: Oh no seen in the clinic.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Just make an appointment.  You get your meds mailed to you right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I'm going to change your Glargine to 32 units okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um let's see what else do we need to refill for you?
PATIENT: Um I don't know.  Unfortunately I've gotten lazy and the wife takes care of that.
DOCTOR: I'll just look.  I just don't want things to expire on you, you know.  Are you still taking the terazosin?  Come in.
SECOND PERSON A930
It's just me.
DOCTOR: Are you still taking your terazosin?
PATIENT: Am I taking whatever she said?
DOCTOR: Um you know what I'll just get a refill for you.  Simvastatin, [REDACTED]. I think everything else you have [REDACTED] So I won't worry about that.  Do you take a docusate every day the stool softener?
PATIENT: Yeah, no.
DOCTOR: Then I won’t worry about it.
PATIENT: I don't think I need [REDACTED] just the opposite.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um [REDACTED] get labs done, if you have time to get them done before your appointment.
SECOND PERSON A930
When does it open the Lab?
PATIENT: The Lab?
DOCTOR: Um you could go down on the first floor or see if they're still around up here.  I think they head out a little bit earlier because it's uh.
PATIENT: Lunchtime.
DOCTOR: Yeah and then yeah how's your peripheral neuropathy?
SECOND PERSON A930
Lousy.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: He can go up on the gabapentin, you're not on the max dose, so do you want to try that?
SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah.
DOCTOR: You can answer for him, that's fine.
SECOND PERSON A930
He looks at me, like neuropathy, what is that?
DOCTOR: No yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don't mind it in the feet and legs, [REDACTED] headache.
DOCTOR: You know how you're taking the 300 tablets?
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I changed it to three every eight hours instead of two every eight hours.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: So it should come to you in the mail but the stuff you have at home you can do that.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay so three instead of two okay.
DOCTOR: Three yes.  So the maximum dose is actually four.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: Every three hours or every eight hours now sometimes when you go up it can make you feel a little bit more like I don't know tired.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: Things like that.
PATIENT: That's what I need.
SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah.
DOCTOR: So just watch it um.  That's why I'm not going up to 1200 three times a day, just going up by one.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: And if this isn't helping we'll try going up by more.  Your kidney function is normal.
SECOND PERSON A930
Right.
DOCTOR: So there's no reason why you can't.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: Go to four.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So Glargine up to 32 units.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: Gabapentin up to three pills three times a day.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: And I put in the Pharm D consult again.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: Just in case um.  You should follow up with Oncology at some point just you know.  I know you already know them through DOCTOR.
SECOND PERSON A930

DOCTOR: The lung cancer doctors.
SECOND PERSON A930

SECOND PERSON A930
Sure.
DOCTOR: But you she'll want you to still get something with them.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: And then follow up with Podiatry okay?
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause you mentioned a supplemental insulin that I could take.
DOCTOR: I think we can start with the Glargine first.
PATIENT: Go up to 32?
DOCTOR: You know since your morning sugars are good and then if we need to then we can add on the other one.  So.
SECOND PERSON A930
So go up to 32 on the insulin.
DOCTOR: Let's assume the control there and then if you start having, but that means to start checking your blood sugars more times during the day, at least one other time, to kind of get an idea of where your sugars are going during the day to see if you need that extra insulin okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Cause I don't know if you need it.
SECOND PERSON A930
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So I think we could just get it under control with the Glargine.
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But if we can't then we can always add it on.
PATIENT: If she'd take all the cakes and pies out of the house I wouldn't need it.
DOCTOR: But it doesn't sound like a very fun house okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
No none.
DOCTOR: Um and is there a reason why you're not on a beta blocker that you know of?  By that I mean anything like metoprolol, carvedilol.
PATIENT: I was.
SECOND PERSON A930
He was on the metoprolol, yeah that one.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON A930
He was on it once and then they didn't refill it or took him off, I don't remember what it was.
DOCTOR: They may want to restart that but I'll let Cardiology discuss that with you because it can be cardio protective to the heart.
SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It's um prior to surgery post and prior.
SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.
DOCTOR: So they may decide to give you that and your heart rate will tolerate it so I don't see any reason not to.  Otherwise you're on everything else that you should be on okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON A930
Any questions?
PATIENT: We want to get out of here, yeah no.
DOCTOR: Antsy, antsy, antsy.  Let me look across [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON A930

PATIENT: Now now.
DOCTOR: I asked [REDACTED] it's not my lucky day [REDACTED].
