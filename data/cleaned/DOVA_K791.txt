DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Have you okay, so it doesn't look like you have sort of inflammation changes, inflammatory arthritis so you probably have an osteoarthritis at this point, [REDACTED] generations.  Um have you tried Tylenol or anything for the pain?
PATIENT: I tried [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay well, it's the anti-inflammatory medicines called ibuprofen, Aleve, Motrin those are the medicines they don't want you to take, those are bad for your stomach.  Tylenol is okay with the stomach but it's bad for the liver.  They don't want you to take large amounts of Tylenol but if you need to take an occasional Tylenol or a Tylenol once a day that's okay.  Tylenol Arthritis, if you did take one or two Tylenol that's not gonna be a big deal.  It's not going to affect your liver.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You don't have liver disease so.
PATIENT: That would help [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It'll help with the pain uh-huh and it may help to some degree with the stiffness.  The anti-inflammatories will help more of the stiffness but I don't want you to take those cause those are bad for your stomach and bad for the kidneys so Tylenol [REDACTED] if you need it okay.  Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds good.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.
PATIENT: I thought maybe you had a magic pill or something.
DOCTOR: No, unfortunately I don't.
