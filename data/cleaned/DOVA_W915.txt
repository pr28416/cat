PATIENT: Right, right.  Okay now to ask you the second question.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Did I take them this morning?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: That would be one reason.

PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: And I was down in Florida.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: See so and there was no refills on the order.

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't remember the date.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So, [REDACTED] here [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's all you're really taking and um that would be why your blood pressure’s a little up.  Even though it's good in the morning it fluctuates throughout the day.
PATIENT: Yeah well it's milder you know after eating and other things and like that why it's bound to go up yeah.
DOCTOR: Right.  Um.
PATIENT: But not as much as what it did.
DOCTOR: Right.  How's the osteoarthritis?  How are your joints feeling?
PATIENT: Bad.
DOCTOR: Bad.  Do you take anything for them?
PATIENT: Um down in Florida why I had, well now it's sore and like that, this ankle and of course arthritis as you know, arthritis goes from one to the other.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Years ago when I was in my 20s I broke both ankles.  I think it was this one that just had, just had the crack and the other one had a spiral fracture into it so arthritis goes back and forth.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Both knees why I've blown those out years and years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I have problems with my knees also and that's why every once in a while I walk with a stick.
DOCTOR: I see, I see.

PATIENT: What kind of a check?
DOCTOR: Labs, just the labs.
PATIENT: Oh the blood you mean.
DOCTOR: Yeah, do you have time for the lab tests?
PATIENT: Yeah sure.
DOCTOR: And for the medication do you want to pick all this up?  Do you normally pick this up from the Pharmacy or have them mailed?
PATIENT: No that takes too long and by the time I would get there why I have my car in the valet.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: And if you don't get there before the valet leaves then you have to walk all the way up to what is it the sixth floor or something like that.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And I can't do that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So no just have it sent, all of them sent.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh the address uh, do you have.
DOCTOR: They should have it in the Pharmacy.
PATIENT: Well yeah but I just changed the address this morning and like that.
DOCTOR: Okay so you have to go, cause I can't change it in the computer.
PATIENT: Now the woman there she said it would change to all of them.
DOCTOR: Okay yep, then it'll change and that's where they'll mail it to you.
PATIENT: Yeah I asked her particular if it would change in the Pharmacy and she said yes.
DOCTOR: Yep, yep.
PATIENT: So I hope they send it to the right place.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: If they don't it goes to Florida, then comes back.
DOCTOR: Let's see oh yeah, that wouldn't be good.
PATIENT: I wouldn't trust the post office too.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm with you.  Um and you needed the [REDACTED].  So the wafer one +40, So how many of those 4 inch by 4 inch wafers do you use each day?
PATIENT: Uh okay you're regularly supposed to use one a day.  I take and cut the center out, that's one time and then there's the edges that I use that's another time so two of them uh, one lasts for a week.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And there are five into a box.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay, so you need six boxes, I see okay, got it.
PATIENT: Now that's to take me to six months I hope.  If that doesn't why I'll be here and I can order it but when I'm down in Florida why uh, I can send the order back and like that if I get an order but if there wasn't any refills or like that well then I'm sort of stuck.
