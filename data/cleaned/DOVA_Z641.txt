When I came back out of service I moved to Maywood with my wife cause I married her while I was in service and uh we looked around, we lived with my mother-in-law and father-in-law for 3 1/2 years.  We were looking for a place to buy.  So we finally found a place and then we took the two of them with em, they went with us.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: There was a couple of rooms finished off in the basement in the house we bought.  They were with me for over 20 some years.
DOCTOR: Wow.  Was that here in Forest Park?
PATIENT: No Melrose Park.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They were living in Maywood and we lived with them for 3 1/2 years.

PATIENT: And uh sometimes when I sing it irritates my throat.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I was just wondering if I ought to see a throat specialist.
DOCTOR: Are you getting pain when you swallow?
PATIENT: Sometimes without any, without any reason it kind of irritates a little bit.
DOCTOR: Um, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh just recently.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So it's been going on for several days in a row or does it come and go kind of?
PATIENT: Oh, well sometimes, no it's longer than a few days uh.  Occasionally I get hoarse and even when I'm talking to my daughter on the phone, she dad, what's the matter with your voice and she notices the irregularity.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Right now it's, not, it's not quite the pitch that it usually is.
DOCTOR: Um has this been like for, I guess what I'm trying to ask you is this just something kind of coming over or like has it been there for a while now?
PATIENT: No it comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not like uh.
PATIENT: Not like a constant.
DOCTOR: I gotcha.  Um any, so no real pain, you're able to swallow food okay for the most part?
PATIENT: Oh no, no, no, uh.  I still have my tonsils I don't know if that's any indication.

PATIENT: Occasionally but not too much.
DOCTOR: Uh day or night that you're coughing?

PATIENT: Uh, well they treated me for allergies down here but I think it was, I think it was a dust allergy that I got when I was working up cleaning out my attic.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, okay um.  Yeah you had medication for that at this point.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Have you been around anyone who's been sick?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Anybody around has been sick?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Okay, well let's take a look and kind of see [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: Okay how long ago?
PATIENT: Oh two months.

DOCTOR: That's a little bit higher than before right?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: That's a bit higher than prior.
PATIENT: Yeah a little bit higher.  I'm getting ready to send in for a refill on my hydrochlorothiazide.  I've got about 30 days left.  Lisinopril you sent me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Uh you also have protein in your urine as well and we had both of those, I know lisinopril is one and there's another medicine that's kind of diabetes management.  Um okay.  You want to have a seat up here for me?
PATIENT: Oh sure.
DOCTOR: Uh, [REDACTED], got it.  Can I get you to take your shoes and socks off?
PATIENT: Oh sure.  This helps.  I'm not as limber as I used to be.
DOCTOR: You're the most nimble 90-year-old person I've seen.
PATIENT: Huh.
DOCTOR: You're the most nimble 90-year-old guy I've seen.
PATIENT: (Laughs).  Oh I come in every couple of months and they clip my toenails for me cause I can't reach them down there.

PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED] this looks pretty good.  Where do you have the numbness?  Do you feel [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  I can feel it in there.  It's.

PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How far up does it go?
PATIENT: Oh about, about where you've got your thumb.
DOCTOR: Right here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.
PATIENT: I was, I went down to uh Texas in August.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My granddaughter graduated from basic training for the Air National Guard.
DOCTOR: Oh wow.
PATIENT: And uh I had to fly down to Albuquerque and then we drove down to San Antonio.
DOCTOR: Holy cow, that's a long drive.
PATIENT: Oh year it is, 12 hours.
DOCTOR: Yeah, Texas is a big state you know.
PATIENT: And uh.
DOCTOR: Was it the summer or what?
PATIENT: You noticed.
DOCTOR: Isn't it hot down there in August?
PATIENT: Not bad.
DOCTOR: San Antonio?
PATIENT: It wasn't bad.  Well I'm used to it.  I was down there for two years during the war.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah?
PATIENT: I was in Galveston, between.
DOCTOR: Galveston is hot yeah.
PATIENT: I was between Galveston and Houston at Camp Wallace for two years.
DOCTOR: Did you like it down there?
PATIENT: Well it was nice.  I had my wife with me for a year.
DOCTOR: Deep breath in and out.  Breathe normal.
PATIENT: You want the shirt off?
DOCTOR: That's fine.  Almost done.  Alright.
PATIENT: Well that sounds alright.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Let's take a look at your throat, can you say ah?
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Mmm, not too bad okay.  Did you take your blood pressure medicine today?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is high.
PATIENT: No, oh yeah it is every time I come in.  I got the white coat syndrome.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: My had it too.
DOCTOR: Do you check it at home?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: What is it at home?
PATIENT: Today I think it was 132/51 if I'm not mistaken.
DOCTOR: Do you check it every day?
PATIENT: Every day, every morning at 7 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Wow.  Okay.  Do you mind if I check it?
PATIENT: No, no, be my guest.  Do you the sleeve off?
DOCTOR: No just higher, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Whatever you need, you just tell me that's all.  We'll get along fine.
DOCTOR: (Laughs).  Just relax your arm.
PATIENT: I should of brought my book along, cause I check my blood sugar every morning too.  I think this morning it was 132.  The only thing on that machine that they gave me to test your blood pressure, the pulse always shows up low.
DOCTOR: Does it?
PATIENT: Today it was 41.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is lower.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I know that.
PATIENT: It's usually lower than average.
DOCTOR: Average yeah.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Well if you want to check it, you just get a stop watch or look at a clock and you can compare the two you know.
PATIENT: Well I did, they did that here for me uh.  One of the previous doctors I had was wondering whether I needed a pacemaker or not so they had, uh EKGs, a couple of those and uh then they said well we're gonna send you to the doctor, well they sent me to the head man.  I was fortunate to get the best and uh he looked at the EKGs and he checked me over like you're doing and he said what the hell did they send you in here for?
DOCTOR: (Laughs)
PATIENT: He says go home and enjoy your life.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  But.
PATIENT: They took the pulse and it was low.  He took it and it was at normal.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So it could have been uh yeah.  User error right?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, so let's go with your feet.  I think this is probably diabetic.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um, you know it's not unexpected having diabetes as long as you have.
PATIENT: Well, I see this [REDACTED] advertising medicine on TV, PAD.
DOCTOR: That's different.
PATIENT: Is it?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh, oh okay.
DOCTOR: I don't think you have that.
PATIENT: No I.
DOCTOR: That's different.
PATIENT: I was just wondering, I didn't know.
DOCTOR: That's poor blood flow down to your legs and I don't think you got that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You may have some; you know maybe not the best blood flow.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Just given that we know you have heart problems.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You've been walking the earth for @@ [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You've expect that from that but it's not the episode you're describing.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You're describing sounds like the very beginnings of diabetic neuropathy.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Which is a complication of diabetes.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Other complications that we see is kidneys and the eyes.
PATIENT: Uh question, I have a stationary bicycle in the basement.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I get down there whenever I think of it, I get down there and I get on for about 15 minutes, does that help?
DOCTOR: Shouldn't have much affect.
PATIENT: Won't have much?
DOCTOR: It's not the blood circulation.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: I mean it's good for your diabetes in general to be active.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: But this is after time just the sugar uh damages the nerves.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: After a period of time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So uh, it's a chronic condition.  It's not reversible really.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um you just kind of try to treat it symptomatically if you can so, there's a couple ways we can go with it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We try medication, there's a couple medications for this, I don't think it works very well.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And now you know whenever you add another medication there's the risks of side effects and those type of things or two we just go on without medication.  Um, the best way to treat it is just to keep good control of your blood sugar and do those types of things.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Blood sugar, blood pressure.
PATIENT: I hear that.  I have trouble there because I gotta a nice neighbor, an Italian widow and she and my wife were like this.  Now that my wife's gone, she feels that she has to take care of me.
DOCTOR: (Laughs).
PATIENT: So I get bowls of pasta and Italian, what do they call those sticks that they make Italian.
DOCTOR: The sausages or what?
PATIENT: No, no, no, like cookies.
DOCTOR: Oh, I know what you're talking about.
PATIENT: You know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yeah those are like those round ones, yeah.
PATIENT: I got a, biscotti yeah.  I got a whole dish of (laughs).
DOCTOR: You can't eat this stuff okay?
PATIENT: I do, I take one.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: One is as much as I take.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh, the throat.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It doesn't look very terrible to me.  I don't feel anything.  I don't think it's infected or anything like that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What it could be is one of two things, allergies or it could just the season you get dry air and that type of thing.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: For some reason it comes and goes.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So um, we could one of two things, we could try to treat the allergies and see how that works um and we could give you, the way you do that is you take a pill for allergies, there's a nasal spray for allergies.  There are also nasal sprays of sterile water that just helps keep everything moist back there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And that might help.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: More.  That's what I would suggest to you.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah, I had uh what difference that I hear in this; oh I remember I was in the drug store.  I went in to get something for a stuffy head.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh I talked to the pharmacist and he didn't notice but there was an elderly gentleman standing to his right and uh after the pharmacist walked away the doctor told him, he says look I'm a doctor, take and use a salt solution, put it in your tent and inhale it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: He said that's as simple as you can get.
DOCTOR: It said living diabetes, right.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's why you're doing the salt water.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's exactly right, you just keep them moist.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We could try something like that.  That you can even buy over-the-counter or I could try to get you some here from the VA but then there's a nasal spray, it's a steroid spray, it helps reduce inflammation.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And uh there's a pill that you take for allergies.  I think this may be allergic or it just may be seasonal but I think we could try to do both of them and see if that kind of makes things better and then we could kind of stop doing them for a time.
PATIENT: Yeah.  No that's alright.  I don't have to sing that much in church because most of the time I'm out in the vestibule cause I'm an usher now.
DOCTOR: You don't want to try these things?
PATIENT: Oh I'll try something sure.
DOCTOR: Okay and then for the feet.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Did you want to try the medication or not?  You know I would propose that we don't, just because they don't work real good.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh and it's a pill that you take three times a day and you have to start out at low doses and you build up and even then it doesn't work very well.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately these are the only things that we don't normally like to treat.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's a complication from diabetes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I mean if you want the medicine, it's basically just to help relieve the symptoms.  You're not having any pain in your feet, just.
PATIENT: Well let's go without it for just now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I kind of like that idea too.
PATIENT: Yeah alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um let me get you set up.  We'll get your labs; I'll refill your medications um.  Why don't you go ahead and get dressed and I'll be back in a couple of minutes okay?
PATIENT: Okie doke.
DOCTOR: Needs some help, got it?
PATIENT: I was just wondering with my instability whether I should be walking with a cane or not.
DOCTOR: Uh do you think you need one?
PATIENT: I'd rather not if I don't need it.
DOCTOR: I'm not gonna tell you, but it's got to be your decision.  I mean you know if you need help.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And uh.
PATIENT: No I uh.
DOCTOR: I can't tell you just by looking at you.
PATIENT: No I can walk pretty good.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm not gonna make you get a cane if you.
PATIENT: Uh I was questioned about that trip to Washington [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: Those things?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: The VFW.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And on the questionnaire if you can walk the length of a football field that'll be one thing but if you need a cane or if you need a wheelchair we will provide it so uh I'm kind of banking on that.
DOCTOR: (Laughs)
PATIENT: I hope to go there spring.
DOCTOR: Well that'd be great.  Alright, give me a minute to get this stuff set-up alright.
PATIENT: Yeah, fine.
DOCTOR: 60:37  DOCTOR IN:  67:31
DOCTOR: Alrighty.  So let's uh.  His blood pressure yeah so.  There's another one that was high too before, uh if you take it at home that's fine.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So let's do this, I'll give you a nasal saline spray.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You get any drops that relieve, it's cheaper than if I gave it to you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Or what I can give you is um the pills for allergies if you want.  I think we should try both and just and if that works then we know that we're kind of hitting the right thing.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: How's that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah that sounds about right.
DOCTOR: So you should probably go pick it up today in the Pharmacy uh, and hopefully it will help you out.  They have them over-the-counter too um but we can get it from here pretty cheap I think.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's just like Claritin or any of those that you can buy.  I'm sure you've seen those and then uh I will see you again, uh what do you think, three months okay?
PATIENT: You tell me.
DOCTOR: Yeah, let's try three months and we could take some labs you at that time.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And you should be fasting because we want to check the cholesterol and that type of thing okay.
PATIENT: I think, I think my wife was using a spray called Afrin.
DOCTOR: Afrin you're not gonna use.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Yeah, let's avoid that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's for uh runny nose mostly and stuffy nose sometimes.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And uh, I don't like it.  It can increase your blood pressure, it can speed your heart up uh.  You kind of become addicted to it so if you don't use it you could have a stuffy nose all the time.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's just a kind of medicine, except for a very specific situation.
PATIENT: Good to know, that's enough.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: I'll take your word for it.
DOCTOR: Uh okay.
PATIENT: Now I should stop downstairs at the Pharmacy.
DOCTOR: You got a couple stops.  First is at the nurses right here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know where that is?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And on your way out, you go to the front desk.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They'll make an appointment in three months.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then you stop at the Pharmacy and they should be getting your medicine ready right now.
PATIENT: Oh, okay.
DOCTOR: So I think by the time you get down there it'll be ready.
PATIENT: Fine, thank you.
DOCTOR: In theory no I mean, it may not be, you know.
PATIENT: No they're pretty good down there.
DOCTOR: Okay so then.
PATIENT: When they say waiting time is a half hour, it usually is about a half hour.
DOCTOR: Um so next time we see you, we'll schedule those labs.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um we'll just do blood draws to make sure your fasting lipids, check your urine too.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And after that and I hope you have a Merry Christmas.
PATIENT: Thank you, same to you.  Good luck.
DOCTOR: Yes thanks.  Stay warm out there huh.
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Try to stay warm out there.
PATIENT: Oh I'm always warm.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I bet I've got more clothes than you could possibly wear in your lifetime.  My wife believed in having everything in the closet.
DOCTOR: Yeah just in case right.
PATIENT: Oh hell.  Up in the attic, when I was cleaning that out, I'm still working on it incidentally.  I see some of her wigs up there yet and stuff like that and uh at one side of the attic; to the stop of the steps she had eight garment bags.  I started at this end and worked through one at a time, her clothes, my clothes.  I came to the last one.  I opened the zipper and I almost fell over.  Ten of my older suits were in there.  When I worked in the office down at Brinks, so I needed clothes but then I went downstairs in the closets, I got 11 outfits down there (laughs).
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] yeah.  It's to have back-ups to your back-ups.
PATIENT: No so every morning I was at home, or every Sunday morning I wear a suit to church, different one all the time you know.  People say what did you do get another suit (laughs).
DOCTOR: Now you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright sir, so the first stop will be the Nurses Station and uh, go right down here to this door and it's on your left side then okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, thank you doctor.
DOCTOR: Take care.  Have a great holiday.
PATIENT: Merry Christmas and have a safe New Year.
DOCTOR: Alright then I'll see you again in uh.
PATIENT: In three months.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it'll be early winter.
PATIENT: Okie doke.
PATIENT: 72:41
Time is 2:55.
