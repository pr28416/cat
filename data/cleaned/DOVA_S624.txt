DOCTOR: How are you sir?
PATIENT: Finally got back, they had me all over the place.
DOCTOR: I know I saw you saw DOCTOR the last time you were here.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] you or something.  They put me there.  No I didn't called [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] so have a seat.  Oh so how you doing?
PATIENT: Uh, like usual, you know.  Once you lose the [REDACTED] you get the magnifying glass [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright so, how is the diabetes?
PATIENT: I don't have to worry about it, [REDACTED] it's under control.
DOCTOR: Right.  How often do you test your sugars?
PATIENT: Well usually about once every three days.  Sometimes I'll go two weeks and if it's in danger or something's a little higher than I think it ought to be.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh during different times, I've done it so much I know just what it should be at different times of the day.  I used to test it three times.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'll go ahead and do it each day one time.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What have you been getting recently?
PATIENT: It's usually between; it's higher now than it has been before but not much.  Uh it used to be between 80 something.  When I go on the starvation and get up in the morning, it used to be about 78, now over 87 but now it's usually between 87 and 100 and it kind of varies a little more.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Your uh, your hemoglobin A1c, the last one, was 5.8 that's perfect um.
PATIENT: I know that uh.
DOCTOR: Great number.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: You do have a little bit of protein in your urine.
PATIENT: Uh my deterioration, I had that before.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But very little.  They're on the outside a bit?
DOCTOR: No, it's still very little um and we have you on the ACE inhibitor, the lisinopril so that's gonna slow that down as much as possible um.  Your creatinine, the measure of your kidney function is stable.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you know I think we're.
PATIENT: High or low or in the normal?
DOCTOR: Its 0.8, normal range.
PATIENT: It's.
DOCTOR: I'm good with that.  They told you about your prostate biopsy as well?
PATIENT: Yeah but I had a mother die and I was gone but uh you now I check it when I get on the website, I know about that.
DOCTOR: They put you on.
PATIENT: All 12 of them were negative.  I don't know if that means anything.  Just the minute they take the test you walk out the door and things change but uh.
DOCTOR: Right and uh so you know when they go in there and do that biopsy they essentially just stab it 12 times.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: To see if they can get something so you know they could have missed something but it's unlikely that they missed any significant prostate cancer.  Prostate cancer is usually a very slow growing thing so even if you had prostate cancer um you know it would be very unlikely that you have a highly malignant tumor.  So I would say following with the GU Clinic is probably the best thing.
PATIENT: We want to find out what's made the PSA go up.
DOCTOR: Right and there are a lot of things that can make the PSA go up.  How many times do you pee at night?
PATIENT: When sleeping?  Never.
DOCTOR: Never.  You can sleep through the whole night?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When you go to the bathroom can you start right away or do you have to wait?
PATIENT: No I'm fine now.
DOCTOR: Fine.
PATIENT: But I had, so I told the other doctor about it, she got me on, I requested the uh.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh what the heck is that clinic?
DOCTOR: The Urology Clinic.
PATIENT: Yeah the Urology Clinic.
DOCTOR: Right, right, right.
PATIENT: And they put me on the and that's the last [REDACTED] thing, peak and flow.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: It's much better now.
DOCTOR: It could have, the elevation in your PSA could have all just been from prostate enlargement.  That could explain every bit of it.  The PSA.
PATIENT: But it's not that enlarged.
DOCTOR: Right, but the PSA is not um a perfect test.  It is not specific for prostate malignancy in any way so if your prostate is enlarged it can cause an elevation in your PSA and it could be totally normal so I think we should just 100% follow this and I don't think.  The only curative therapy would be to have your prostate removed and I don't think that's probably something we were looking for at this point.  Um August is when your next colonoscopy is right.
PATIENT: That's right I need a consult.
DOCTOR: Right.  You don't need a consult you just[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Whey they called me.
DOCTOR: They said you need a consult?
PATIENT: I have to probably get a consult.
DOCTOR: I'll put it in, I'll put it in there and I'll write it on here.
PATIENT: Yeah want the order so but I mean.
DOCTOR: Right, right.  You need your.
PATIENT: Get that one [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: 12 months.
PATIENT: Should I go up to the [REDACTED] Clinic in the hospital?
DOCTOR: Right, right, right.  Um and how's the knee?
PATIENT: Oh it's been fine.
DOCTOR: Everything fine, no problems?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Both of them doing well?
PATIENT: They're all fine.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
PATIENT: Unless they want to fuse this, like they wanted to do my wrist, how's that.
DOCTOR: Your ankle?  I mean it looks good to me.  Are you still doing the martial arts?
PATIENT: Oh hell yes.  I was worn out [REDACTED] six days a week now.
DOCTOR: Yeah your heart rate I remember your heart rate from last time.
PATIENT: Still is [REDACTED] fall.
DOCTOR: Probably a sign of good health as opposed to a sign of anything bad.
PATIENT: Well when we're old all things are going bad you know.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] alternative. I want to do, I wish she'd stop calling, they actually wanted to the colectomy [REDACTED] and I says no, no, no, it's on the right hemisphere, so I said we'll do a right [REDACTED].  Well I had no idea of the potential for the genetics.
DOCTOR: Did you see them at UIC?
PATIENT: Uh yeah and they kind of, “You have to do” and I was “whoa, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'll think about it.”
DOCTOR: Did you get your genetic testing done?
PATIENT: No I never did it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not cause I [REDACTED] but but, nobody sits there and tells me what I'm gonna do.  It's not an exact science.
DOCTOR: Right, right.  And that's, I mean that's fair enough that obviously your decision.  That's not a small surgery so.
PATIENT: I know, [REDACTED] alternative to the normal and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Fine we'll have you see the gastroenterologist again and I guess they'll take another look and you know we can go from there.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right uh do you need refills of any medications?
PATIENT: Just be sure to check the uh, the uh, the uh oh man let me get the thought, yeah the new stuff they're giving me uh the ACE inhibitor.
DOCTOR: You have two refills left.
PATIENT: Oh I do have refills on the bottles?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I never looked.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I [REDACTED].  It seems to be working.  The only thing that's kind of embarrassing that I'm dealing with is I'm still getting blood though when I have sex, you know from the.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: When did that start?
PATIENT: Beg pardon?
DOCTOR: When did it start?
PATIENT: Oh man it didn't start till about three days or something like that after I got home.
DOCTOR: After the biopsy?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: And has it improved?
PATIENT: Hmm I don't know uh.  My partner wouldn't be too happy.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But I mean is the amount of blood getting more or less?
PATIENT: Yeah it's getting less [REDACTED] it's starting to clot you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Something like that but I thought it was about two or three weeks sometimes a lot so.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I wanted to let you know about it.
DOCTOR: Yeah and that's, no that's good and have you seen the urologist since then?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No okay.  You may, I mean obviously you know it happened after the biopsy, it's.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's due to the biopsy.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And your biopsy was how long ago?
PATIENT: Oh man I can't remember.
DOCTOR: It was in April on the 27th.
PATIENT: Yeah I knew it wasn't too long.
DOCTOR: So we're looking at about 30 days ago, no 20 days ago.  I would give it some time.  If it doesn't clear up, you need to be seen by the urologist.
PATIENT: If it gets worse I'll holler.
DOCTOR: If it gets worse you need to come in.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If it doesn't clear up in a week or two you need to be seen by the urologist okay.
PATIENT: Guess what I got.  I winked at him and I said hey how about you do something for me, I love these new procedures I haven't seen them.  When I was in school I didn't have what they got now.  Give me uh a sonar picture of me.
DOCTOR: Oh your prostate.
PATIENT: It was cool man [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Could you see anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Sometimes those ultrasounds are hard to read.
PATIENT: No, they're very easy, very distinct and clear.  I was cleaned out [REDACTED] so I could see all that.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: There is something else I need to ask you.  I think everything's alright um.  Sometimes the alpha blocker works good, other times it hesitates and then with the flow.  I normally [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I'll always have the bladder completely empty anyway.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: After I urinate, except it took longer and I wanted to jump on that, before it got worse.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Uh sometimes it'll cut down sometimes it'll be alright.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The majority is better you know but I don't think there's anything else.
DOCTOR: Sounds good.  Let me take a listen to you real quick.  Deep breath.  Cough for me.  How much are you smoking?
PATIENT: No more than [REDACTED].  I had one in November and then one in December.  Normally a pack will last me a month or more.  Probably about three a week, when I was down there but I just got back on Monday.
DOCTOR: So right now a pack will last you a month?
PATIENT: Oh yeah for a long time.  I've been smoking about three weeks.  You know when I was down there, my mom died in November and my brother and I had been smoking about three cigarettes a week.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But more, I mean you can't do that with martial arts obviously.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Hard truth on the right, no wheezing or rales would be good in the lung right?
DOCTOR: Heart sounded great.  I think the most important thing is the fact that you live with a heart rate of 47.
PATIENT: So I'll live longer.
DOCTOR: Exactly.  That's a sign of good heart health in someone your age.
PATIENT: How about breathing control, its natural now, I feel normal.
DOCTOR: Pardon me?
PATIENT: Breathing control.
DOCTOR: Breathing control.
PATIENT: Through martial arts.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: It just normally drops everything.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I don't know.
DOCTOR: It's working for you.
PATIENT: I don't know if that's cheating my health or not you know.
DOCTOR: I think it's probably helping more than anything alright.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let me go talk to uh DOCTOR and we'll get you moving alright.  Good to see you again.
PATIENT: DOCTOR’S not here today.
DOCTOR: Well he wasn't here earlier.  I don't know if he's going to be in later today or not.  He's a busy guy.  He has a lot of meetings.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: He does, he uh is one of the deans at the medical college so he's involved in a lot.
PATIENT: He took that over?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] right.
PATIENT: He always had it.
DOCTOR: Um he used to be really high up cause he's a dual board certified in medicine and pediatrics.  He used to be one of the big guys in the Pediatric Department but now he's kind of transitioned to one of the deans of the whole medical school so.  He's always moving onward and upward.
PATIENT: Sort of DOCTOR.  Looks like [REDACTED] about COPD [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Pardon me?
PATIENT: You heard the COPD a little more didn't you.
DOCTOR: So you can't really hear it more um.  You are wheezing a little and you can kind of hear when you cough that it's hard for you to get stuff up and that's from your COPD.  That'll probably never get better.  There's only two things that make people with COPD live longer.  One is oxygen if they need it, home oxygen when it gets bad and the other is quitting smoking so.  We can treat your symptoms with all of our medications but the only things that really work.
PATIENT: It's been a long time since I had a pulmonary test but uh you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah um I don't think we need to retest it and here's why.  All of the martial arts and stuff that you do, if you aren't complaining of shortness of breath then your COPD is controlled alright.
PATIENT: Okay so I have no problem.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I think the best thing would be for you to quit smoking so.  The most you can do for that.  Have you seen the Smoking Cessation Clinic here?
PATIENT: I used to do that stuff.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I initiated it.  Even with hypnosis I'm good at it.  I don't want to do that anymore, I'm retired you know.
DOCTOR: Right.  It's just an option.
PATIENT: Most of the time when I smoke three or four cigarettes is because I'm on the computer and sits there and burns then and I look over and say I ain't got a cigarettes so I light another one and burn it rather than smoke it.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yep.
(DOCTOR OUT: 17:31  DOCTOR IN: 30:20)
PATIENT: You still have a year left right?
DOCTOR: I have just over two years left.
PATIENT: Good so.
DOCTOR: Yeah hopefully you should be able to see me every time you come in.
PATIENT: And what I was going to ask you was if you uh see any changes in my uh lab work, let me know up or down.
DOCTOR: I certainly will.
PATIENT: And if you know anything I can do to improve what I'm doing uh let me know and I'll jump right on it.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: The um, the things to be concerned about right now are the diabetes and your kidneys.  So your glucose control is great, probably some of the best I have of any of my patients and the most important thing with the progression of diabetic kidney disease is blood pressure control.  Your blood pressure is very well controlled so I'm not concerned at all right now.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Your diabetic kidney disease will progress.  There's nothing we can do to stop it from progressing but you are, 64.
PATIENT: 64 last June.
DOCTOR: In June.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: This will likely progress slowly enough that you will die of something else before you know we need to do dialysis or something.
PATIENT: Well when I first found out, I had nobody in the family with diabetes so that's Agent Orange crap.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it come up on a normal blood test and when I got home the Emergency Room called me and said you got a blood sugar level of 900 get in here, I don't know how you're even walking and I found out about it.  Well uh after I found that out I was able to you know I eat, whatever most people [REDACTED] to what they eat, I just want it somewhere in the range, [REDACTED].  Uh you know most people don't know that that's how they tell the deterioration of the kidneys is that flow change.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Alright so you can come back and see me in four months.  We'll get your scope done in August and I don't think either of these appointments need to be scheduled today.  They'll send you the letters for both of them.
PATIENT: Later on.
DOCTOR: You should be getting a letter before too long for the optometrist.
PATIENT: Good, good, good.
DOCTOR: End of June is when you I think was when your last one was so you need to see them once a year so that'll be when your next one is.
PATIENT: Now let me, they do this system now and it sucks [REDACTED] from now.
DOCTOR: Right. I agree.
PATIENT: If the appointment is in for a year I have no idea when you're gonna have it.  I mean we got to change that.  Thank you so much.
DOCTOR: You're welcome.
PATIENT: You I'm really happy to be your patient.
DOCTOR: Thank you.  You're one of my favorite patients.  You're doing well under the circumstances.
PATIENT: Of course when I walk out this door, anything can happen you know.
DOCTOR: Let's hope it doesn't.
PATIENT: The ringing is only just for the minute they [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Take care sir.
PATIENT: This goes to the desk.
DOCTOR: Actually you don't have to take it to anyone because they'll mail you both of those.  You can only schedule appointments that are within the next 30 days at the desk so both of those will be scheduled and they'll mail you a letter.
PATIENT: They'll reschedule and send them to me.  Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, thank you.
PATIENT: Glad you gave me a copy of this, it's real precious.
DOCTOR: You're welcome.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yep, take care.
PATIENT: 33:54
