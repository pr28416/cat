DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] over here. All right.  Dr. DOCTOR usually is the person who takes care of you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well he.
DOCTOR: What can I do for ya?
PATIENT: Well, the reason uh we called today is they called me to uh, uh talk to my doctor about the brace I had on my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The reason I didn't uh wear it today is because uh uh the weather was bad and I couldn't get transportation, anybody drive me, so I took it off and drove it myself.  But for the past four or five days now I've been taking it off after supper which is 4 o'clock till about 6 and I'm walkin around the room and going downstairs and stuff like that, not doing any steps and things and it hasn't been bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I got the new walker so it helps.
DOCTOR: Before that it was bothering you?
PATIENT: Yeah, I my balance and stuff like that and uh, uh, the swelling and everything went down and they finally took more x-rays and it so they said it wasn’t an infection or anything it was arthritic, arthritic condition.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And they can't give me nothing for it until after the operation I'm having Thursday.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you have some left knee pain?
PATIENT: Not now, no.
DOCTOR: That's what it was like before.
PATIENT: Yeah, this whole thing, I couldn't sit, and turn it, I couldn't bend it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know like now I can, I always have to keep it straight, but for the past couple of months I've been wearing that brace and just taking it off at night.
DOCTOR: And now you're taking it off after dinner?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Like uh about three days now I've been taking it off and walking around and . . .
DOCTOR: You've been able to walk okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, now yeah, yeah, real good now.  Before I couldn't, without without that brace I couldn't walk uh, I couldn't walk five feet.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You're not wearing any right now though?
PATIENT: No, no.  And the antibiotics they gave me and painkillers they gave me have actually been killing, killing the stuff and the swelling.
DOCTOR: Now, so who gave you that uh, those medications that you're talking about?
PATIENT: Uh, I got the paper here, in the Emergency Room.
DOCTOR: Okay, that was when you were here at the ER.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: All right.
PATIENT: She didn't do nothing with me, I haven't seen her since you know, I think, I didn't know you're supposed to talk to her, I thought I was supposed to go back to the Emergency and they would take it off or something, that's the reason uh I couldn't see her until way up till next year.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  All right.  I'm gonna read, just looking at the X-ray report.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: All right, looks like things are doing a lot better.  The x-ray looks fine and it sounds like your symptoms are better now?
PATIENT: I'm smiling.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Let's take a look here.  All right.  So where was the pain mainly?
PATIENT: Right in this, in this area here.  I couldn't do this and if I did, I'd be crying.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's terrific pain.
DOCTOR: And now you're able to move it better?
PATIENT: Yes if I don't, if I don't like in bed, if I don't push too fast, too far, uh I'm alright.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: If I do I feel it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But otherwise if I just take my time getting up and walking and turning and that stuff, hey I can do without the brace, I even drove a car first time in two months.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent.  And the other knee how's that one doing?
PATIENT: Well that's uh, it ain't bad but you know, yeah.  They figured it's gonna go the same way.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And that's tough, I don't know why.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well since its, since it’s doing so much better I don't think that we have a whole lot of work to do today.  I'm glad to hear that.
PATIENT: Yeah, you, oh God.  I talked it over with the head nurse at the retirement place and I said off the record, I said what'd happen to me if I, if I took it off and I sit for a couple of hours instead of taking it off at 9 or 10 o'clock at night and going to bed, what if I take it off at 6 and walk around with a walker and she said try it, so she was with me three nights in a row.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And she says how ya doing, how's your balance, you tell me how my balance is and she say you're good alright.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Try it.
DOCTOR: I would say just follow that same pattern, take it off a little bit earlier.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And make sure that you've got some stability.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright good.
PATIENT: With this is the new walker that they gave me downstairs it helps a lot.  I borrowed a buddy of mines [REDACTED].  I used to walk with a cane but that was not stable enough and I couldn't drive my car but uh no, as far as my sugar and blood pressure, I I brought my books with me if you want.
DOCTOR: No that's alright I'm going to have Dr. DOCTOR take care of most of that.
PATIENT: Alright, okay, alright.
DOCTOR: I think though looking at your numbers everything looks very good.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You're uh diabetes looks good.
PATIENT: Uh, I need some test strips for my sugar, uh, do I call the . . .
DOCTOR: No I can get it for ya.
PATIENT: Yeah, oh okay.  I got about ten strips left, Monday, Wednesday and Friday and that's three, six, nine, I've got about the end of the month to go with.  I always like to get ahead of time.  No that's good to hear.  No all I got to do is sweat out Thursday.
DOCTOR: Thursday what's that?
PATIENT: That's the operation of the colon or the bladder.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah that's right.
PATIENT: And that's what I'm afraid of.
DOCTOR: You're going to be okay.
PATIENT: Um.  In the 1970s, late 1970s, I had prostate cancer and that was uh partially malignant and stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So, and I couldn't do nothing for, I went there the day after, the Monday after Labor Day and I didn't go back to work until the week of Thanksgiving so, all that time off, I figured oh God this things gonna be the same way, I'm kind of jumpy.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I don't know if this one's gonna be quite like that.
PATIENT: No?
DOCTOR: I don't think it is.
PATIENT: And every time I hear the word malignancy that, that uh, that's what my wife died of.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it makes you think about that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Well.
PATIENT: And me, I as a Polish guy that's a joke.
DOCTOR: Come on up here.
PATIENT: That's a joke, I I you talk about being Polish and that's got two strikes on ya.
DOCTOR: Ha, ha.
PATIENT: But uh, the first strike was in the 1970s with malignant cancer of the prostate, [REDACTED] was malignant so that's what I'm kind of scared of.
DOCTOR: Yeah well, you'll just have to see what happens.
PATIENT: You want me to take it off?
DOCTOR: That's okay I'll put it on over the top. They already checked it once, I'm gonna check it again.
PATIENT: Yeah, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I like your hat.
PATIENT: That's yeah, uh, uh, I was buying some tools at a tool place right by the house there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh, and she says my sister works there as an assistant or something, to help vets and she gave me this.
DOCTOR: It’s very nice. [REDACTED].  Alright you can lay back down, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go talk with my boss about what's going on but I think I like the way your knee is healing.
PATIENT: Hey I would be, I wouldn't be smiling if it uh wasn't, look.  Oh God this thing's been bothering me for a long time.
DOCTOR: The knee finally, the knee is finally getting better huh?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Well I wouldn't give up on the brace all together.
PATIENT: No, no, no.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Alright.  Yeah, I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
(DOCTOR OUT: 84:04 DOCTOR IN:  88:46)
DOCTOR: Okay.  I think uh, about the knee, what I want you to do is wear the brace when you're not gonna be too active um, during the day.  Take it off after dinner.  You can try taking it off a little earlier each day if you want to, make sure that the knee is feeling good and not feeling off balance or anything and then as you gradually take it away you won't need it at all but I'd keep it around.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, that uh, I got it right by the bed there.
DOCTOR: Yeah because I think it's gonna be helpful for you to have around.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: If it feels unstable or starts to hurt again.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay?
PATIENT: I feel uh, I could never do this, this or this, oh God.
DOCTOR: That's terrific.  No, I'm I'm so happy for you as well.
PATIENT: (Crying) This was . . . I’m living at this place for three years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh, I thought I'd found a place, then the damn stroke two years ago and this thing here, oh shit this uh.
DOCTOR: And you said they wouldn't let you stay there?
PATIENT: Uh no, just the idea of ya see, uh, the years of contentment and stuff like that you know, they kind of you know, and I figured that's what I wanted you know and I lost my wife 13 years ago and I'm living by myself and no cooking, no nothing and you know and then finding a place you got meals and once a week they, they come in and clean your apartment and stuff, they have good meals.
DOCTOR: I'm grateful for how good you're feeling as well.
PATIENT: A lot of activities up there everything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So, they're real helpful, their real courteous.
DOCTOR: Sounds like a perfect fit for you.
PATIENT: Not only the tenants up there, the neighbors, the management oh they uh, when I came here one time with the leg and that stuff and when I was passing blood and uh I caught hell because I didn't say nothing to them, oh when I come back they really raised holy hell with me.
DOCTOR: Yeah I bet they did.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh, you've got an appointment with Dr. DOCTOR coming up.
PATIENT: Okie doke.
DOCTOR: In about three months so.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Uh about those, about those test strips.

DOCTOR: No, don't worry about it.  This is one of the best experiences I had today on rounds.
PATIENT: Yeah.  People bitch and moan about hospitals and stuff like that but I'm so damn proud to come in here.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
PATIENT: I finally changed my mind.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I used to come here in 1949.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And gifts to the Yanks and stuff like that to deliver packages to all the guys in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh, all the reservists from five different armories in Chicago would wrap gifts and then we'd pick them up with the tractor trailers and bring em up here to Hines, Great Lakes, Fort Sheridan, West Side, [REDACTED] Hospital and here.  We all used to pay tribute to the [REDACTED] Hines as we come up the old building.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: They used to have that big portrait that used to hang from ceiling on down to the floor, standing and they’d always film us saluting when we'd come in.  His father was real good about building the place, donating property here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The whole mile, mile square you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Alright sir, good luck with your surgery.
PATIENT: I hope that, I hope it comes off, ha ha.
DOCTOR: I think it's gonna go well.  I really think it's gonna go well for you.

DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: 103.
DOCTOR: Oh my goodness.
PATIENT: My father was 95.
DOCTOR: That's a long life.
PATIENT: And uh, I hope I can continue with that but the way I'm going now, I feel like I'm lucky if I reach 85.  I just passed 84 so I don't know.
DOCTOR: I think, I think what's important is how well you live, not how long.
PATIENT: Well this place here, that's what I'm teed off about, being sick like that and because with all the activities they got up there.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you got some friends that live in there too?
