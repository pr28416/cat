DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: How you doing?
DOCTOR: Doing fine.  How are you?
PATIENT: Good morning.
DOCTOR: Good morning sir.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Good to see you.
PATIENT: Good to be seen.
DOCTOR: Come on back.
PATIENT: Uh.  So you're not way in back anymore?
DOCTOR: Yeah there's, you know, moving and shaking it.
PATIENT: Okay, where do you want me?
DOCTOR: Right here is fine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: How are you?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: How you been doing?
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So let's see, what's new?
PATIENT: Not too much.  No problems, no pain, no aches.
DOCTOR: Good.  So um, let's see I wanted to get some labs um this morning to check the.
PATIENT: I know I've been down there.
DOCTOR: I saw that.  So, yeah I know where it is, okay it's a little lower than before, 2.05, the last one was 2.48.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh so it's still therapeutic.  Um did you eat this morning?
PATIENT: Yeah, well I've had some small rolls.
DOCTOR: Some rolls.
PATIENT: Uh with cinnamon and nut you know.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: But uh.
DOCTOR: Your sugar today was 226 which is not very good.  But you ate this morning.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you got send a fasting specimen.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I’d like to see it less.  The problem is the number that I really wanted was this glycosylated hemoglobin, that's the hemoglobin A1c number.  The drew it, but it's still running in lab because that's the number that tells us how you've been doing with your sugars over a three months span.
PATIENT: Hmm.  Oh.
DOCTOR: So it's our best way to see you know where you're at.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Your last one, cause when did I see you last?
PATIENT: Couple months ago.
DOCTOR: Was it in February?
PATIENT: I think.
DOCTOR: It was 9.9, which is high and you want to be below 7.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And your last one was 8.7 so depending on how you've been doing; we may have to change up some of your medications uh today, because you weren't taking the metformin right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So we switched you to the longer acting, just the one dose but 1000 mg right?
PATIENT: I guess.
DOCTOR: Have you been taking it?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  Why?
PATIENT: Uh I don't know.  I was still getting the diarrhea.
DOCTOR: Even this one?
PATIENT: No I haven't taken this one yet.
DOCTOR: So I thought we talked about this last time that the reason we switched this one.
PATIENT: I didn't know we switched, I thought I was still doing the regular metformin.
DOCTOR: No this one, remember we said we were gonna give you the one that was one pill 1000 mg because it has been shown to have less GI side effects, less diarrhea than the other one.
PATIENT: Oh okay.  Alright.
DOCTOR: So did they send those to you?
PATIENT: Yeah I got them.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you just didn't take them.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we definitely want to try that.
PATIENT: Okay.  Oh I got confused.  I guess I wasn't aware of that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That you changed the pill.
DOCTOR: Right.  So uh you know I.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You definitely want to try that.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Because I'm guessing since you are not taking it, your hemoglobin level, the sugar levels going to be real high.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you're still taking the glyburide right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: 10 twice a day and what else, that's it right?
PATIENT: No.  Carvedilol or whatever.
DOCTOR: Well no for diabetes, just the.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: The carvedilol.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: The aspirin, the albuterol when you need it, the inhaler.
PATIENT: Uh yeah.
DOCTOR: The Combivent medicine or Combivent inhaler.  The metformin, the lisinopril, you take the simvastatin and the Coumadin.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And the Coumadin.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Otherwise how you been doing?
PATIENT: Fine, no problems.
DOCTOR: Another thing that we had to do was the Sleep Clinic.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Just because we had talked about that, but you cancelled your appointment and said you didn't want to be seen.
PATIENT: Yeah I, I don't.
DOCTOR: So what happened?
PATIENT: Uh well I wasn't sure you know.  Like I say um I can't see where that's gonna be any benefit to me.  I mean I'm you know, I sleep fine.
DOCTOR: Well yeah, you do sleep fine but uh the problem is that the last sleep study that you had showed concern for a type of sleep apnea that we call central sleep apnea which could be a result of the previous strokes, cause you've had strokes in the past right?
PATIENT: In 2002 I had two strokes, that's the only strokes I've had.
DOCTOR: So you know that's what is very important for your future health.  We want to make sure that you in fact need it and that's why I wanted to do the sleep study test.  You know what I'm saying?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Well like I said I know a lot of people that have CPAPs and that uh, they don't use them anymore.  They put it aside.
DOCTOR: But that's that could be fine for them.
PATIENT: And uh.
DOCTOR: But you have different reasons why you need it.
PATIENT: Well also too uh one reason was the guy said it costs me $1000 and I ate got that kind of money.
DOCTOR: That's what he told you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well I'm sure there are ways that we could subsidize that through the VA or something.  I'll have to look into that.
PATIENT: Right, well that's what the guy told me and that's why I said.
DOCTOR: I still think it, I still think it'd be worthwhile for you to be seen in that clinic but you're not interested at all?
PATIENT: No I'm not.  I'm not really interested in it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um because you know just so you know the danger of sleep apnea is you know increased blood pressure and um it can have effects on your lungs and your heart that can be, you know and given your diabetes and you're already uh history of heart failure and things like that, those are.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know what I mean it's uh; it will worsen those things if not treated.  So I just want you to be aware of that.
PATIENT: Yeah right, I know.
DOCTOR: And it's, you know, it's ultimately your decision what you do.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But I just want you to know.
PATIENT: I just as soon forget it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and I saw that you saw the uh, you were seen in the Podiatry Clinic.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Did they fix up your toes a little bit better?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  I go to go back to them.
DOCTOR: Three months.
PATIENT: Oh three months from then.
DOCTOR: Oh from when they saw you.
PATIENT: From when they saw me.
DOCTOR: So um the only other thing is a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And uh they wanted me to let you know that you are at a little bit higher risk for that procedure um because of the sleep apnea, because of your COPD.  When they sedate you, uh sometimes it's just a little bit more dangerous um in those people because of your previous heart condition and your previous lung [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh, yeah.
DOCTOR: But they monitor all those things.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: They just want you to be aware of that.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: They wanted me to document that I talked to you about that.
PATIENT: Right.  Well when you say um a risk or whatever uh, I've never heard that before on a colonoscopy about being uh.
DOCTOR: Well because, it's because of the medicines that they give you to sedate you.  Um you know because you have the previous stroke and the atrial fibrillation and the COPD and the heart failure and the sleep apnea, you know it sometimes, the sedation is dangerous, it can depress your drive to breathe and sometimes will require people to be intubated you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's the danger with that and so um, you know I wanted to make you aware of that and uh.
PATIENT: Well when you think about the risk.
DOCTOR: Right it's definitely increased because of your uh, you know underlying conditions.  I'm going to talk with my attending about it today and see.
PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: What he thinks but I.
PATIENT: Yeah well if I don't have a colonoscopy I mean there's a risk too.
DOCTOR: There's a risk of that too obviously.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I mean unfortunately you're a little bit between a rock and a hard place.  I think that, I think you'd probably be fine.  They like to be sure uh that we're comfortable with that.  So that's the only problem.
PATIENT: Well you'd be a better judge of that than I am.
DOCTOR: No absolutely.  Um and that's the only problem with the sleep apnea too is the fact that you're not using the CPAP at all so it puts you at a higher risk than someone.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Someone that you know what I mean so, so.
PATIENT: I'll take a shot what the hell.  If I die, I die.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well I don't.
PATIENT: I'm a Catholic, I that's just the beginning.
DOCTOR: Fair enough but uh I think we would obviously want to prevent that.
PATIENT: I know I would like to prevent it too.
DOCTOR: And I don't think that it will, I don't think it would come to that but uh.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'll ask my attending to make sure he's comfortable with it, but I think.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It should be okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Otherwise you're good on your meds?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You have all your refills and things?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Any recent weight changes, headaches, vision changes, fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, things like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Doing okay otherwise?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um cause the last time you said that your energy level had been down over the past six months to a year, do you still feel that way?
PATIENT: Yeah I'm 63.  I mean that's the problem with getting older.  You don't know, something happens and you don't know, is this something to be concerned about or is this just part of the aging process?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean there's no book on aging.
DOCTOR: Right.  I definitely think that some of your uh fatigue is probably caused from the sleep apnea.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: And so you know you can expect to be a little tired because you know, understand again what happens is that your throat closes when you're sleeping.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Because of the tissue in your neck.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You stop breathing.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But your body wakes you up enough that it allows you to take a deep breath but it doesn't actually wake you up so you don't know this is happening.  So um, so you never get into the dream state of sleep and so you wake up real tired.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: The only way, unfortunately, to correct that is to use the CPAP machine.
PATIENT: Yeah well.
DOCTOR: And you're not interested in that.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So then there will be a component of fatigue.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And uh but um no shortness of breath, no sore throats, no weakness in your legs, you know urinating, moving your bowels okay, no problems?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Your vision's okay?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good.  Well have a seat up here I'm just going to take a quick listen to you and then have a seat.  What else is new, anything?
PATIENT: Nothing really.
DOCTOR: What'd you give up for Lent?
PATIENT: Nothing (laughter).  I didn't tell you I was a devout Catholic.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Deep breaths.  Again, again, one more.  Okay.  Are you losing any weight at all?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: No, are you trying?
PATIENT: No.  I'm was back when I had my stroke [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How much do you weigh now?
PATIENT: 250.  I tell you, I don't eat a lot uh you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Alright uh yeah, so the glycosylated hemoglobin number is 10, up from 9.9 so you're headed in the wrong direction.  But if you haven't been taking the metformin.
PATIENT: I'll start taking it.
DOCTOR: Cause the problem is that if you don't take the metformin, the next thing to do is insulin shots.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And uh do you want me to just switch to that now?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Cause that's where we're heading.  The problem is that if we don't get your sugars under control, um we're going to put you on insulin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know what I mean so.  We really need to get the metformin going but.
PATIENT: Uh no like I said I'll do a better job of my sugar intakes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But you're also; I think your body is just to the point where it needs medicine anyway.  It's not, I mean you still need to monitor your sugar intake, you know low carbs, no; you know less bread, less pastas all that stuff.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Um but um your body needs help now because your pancreas is kind of shot at this point and so uh we need to give you these medicines to help.  So it's really important that you do take that metformin.
PATIENT: Okay, I'll take it when I get home.
DOCTOR: And let me know, if it's still not working.  You know and you're still getting the diarrhea.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And things like that then we may have to switch you to the insulin.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Let me chat with them real quick and I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  58:16  DOCTOR IN:  67:24)
DOCTOR: Okay, well you know I spoke to my attending and looking back at you know.  The reason we were doing colonoscopy is because you've never had it before.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: The truth is that the stool cards you've had uh in the past were negative.  You do have a lot of risks.  I don't want to mess with it so let's do the stool cards like you did before.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: You know how to do these and everything?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then uh I would like you to follow up in 3-4 weeks with one of our pharmacists here, just to make sure that the medications working okay, that metformin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um uh because I don't want you to go and not be taking…
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Just because of the side effects.
PATIENT: Alright.  Okie doke.
DOCTOR: And then um you know uh that's about it and I'll see you in three months.
PATIENT: Okay.  Take it easy doc.
DOCTOR: Alrighty.  This is for you.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: It's something for when you check out.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah take it easy.
DOCTOR: Thanks.
PATIENT: 68:52
Time is 9:25.
