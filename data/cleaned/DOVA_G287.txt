PATIENT: You guys have done that before and I think that's pretty cool.
DOCTOR: Yeah we're gonna do metformin 1000 mg b.i.d.
PATIENT: Now should I, cause you know I was talking to a friend of mine who also takes metformin and he told me that because I hadn't taken it sometimes for diabetes that you always have to be sure to take it after you eat something.
DOCTOR: Yeah you should, on a full stomach cause then you'll feel, you'll get like gassy and all that.

PATIENT: But I really only try to eat meat like one [REDACTED] every day.
DOCTOR: Why don't we put you back on the hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I'll leave it at that okay and then Naproxen.  The Naproxen you have to take omeprazole with it because it's something for your, it'll upset your stomach.  Okay.
PATIENT: Oh you said you could handle the referral so that I could just call and make an appointment with Physical Therapy?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: About $130 but to me that seemed like a lot.
DOCTOR: That is a lot yeah.  That's a lot for me too.
PATIENT: So if I call in six different medicines plus the strips and things like that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh yeah.
PATIENT: Did you order me more strips by the way as well?  Like along with all the other stuff?
DOCTOR: No I didn't, let me put that in.
PATIENT: Just so I could have the records, I couldn't tell you what kind of machine I have.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll need to know so I can order the strips correctly.  Um what I would do is I would call.  I would look at the machine and call the pharmacist here and ask what type of machine it is so then they can send me little like reminder to order it.
PATIENT: Okay that's fine.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're welcome.
