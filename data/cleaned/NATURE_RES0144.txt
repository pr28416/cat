PATIENT: Pregnancy was uh, OK, no complications, but he was premature by two weeks, so I think he was born at 35 and four days.
DOCTOR: OK, and were there any complications at that time, including complications related to the lung, something like respiratory distress syndrome?
PATIENT: Yeah, so when he was born there was they needed to do, I forgot what it was, but they told me that initially he wasn't breathing, but then right afterwards after like within 5 minutes, he was fine.
DOCTOR: Hmm, uhm, OK, uhm, was he kept in the hospital in the NICU after being born?
PATIENT: Yeah, just because of that scare, they kept him for three more days, but like he was growing while there were no more episodes of the breathing issue, so they let him go after.
DOCTOR: OK. Uhm, has, how has he been since then over the past six months?
PATIENT: Since then, he's been fine. No, we didn't have to go to the hospital or anything, and during our routine visits he's been growing well, no normal issues.
DOCTOR: Any issues because development?

DOCTOR: OK. Alright, well we'll examine the child and look at his vitals, listen to his lungs, look, look inside his mouth and that's this sounds serious, so we'll keep you, we'll keep you updated and we'll let you know what needs to be done. He might need, potentially need antibiotics. He might need potentially, to be intubated, but we will have all these discussions after the baby's been seen and we'll draw some labs and go from there.
