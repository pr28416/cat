DOCTOR: Hello PATIENT.
PATIENT: Hello.
DOCTOR: How are things going?
PATIENT: Fine.
DOCTOR: Fine okay.  Well my name is DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Hi.
DOCTOR: Uh I'm going to be your primary care physician and I was just, I think I was expecting you in July but you didn't come.
PATIENT: Yeah I totally forgot the appointment.
DOCTOR: Yeah and then uh, it looks like you had [REDACTED] scheduled [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh, I have, an unpredictable schedule.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, alright so all I have here for PATIENT uh, it looks like the main issue right now is high cholesterol and you had a surgery of uh your ankle.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Left ankle and then I think that's about it of what we have in the chart so far.  You don't have much issues going on?  Okay and then you come here for yearly check-ups.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How's your ankle doing?
PATIENT: It always hurts.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Uh there's nothing.
DOCTOR: Why did you get a surgery for it, do you know?
PATIENT: Yeah um I basically broke my ankle back in '88.
DOCTOR: Oh in 1988 and you had surgery for how many different times?
PATIENT: Seven.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] when was the last time?
PATIENT: January @@st in [REDACTED]@.
DOCTOR: Okay and uh and your feeling is it's not getting any better?
PATIENT: It’s always there.
DOCTOR: Uh do you take any pain medication for that?
PATIENT: Oh I was on Vicodin and I had, but it was only if I need it and I ran out.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I just never came back for it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um but you're doing fine without that or do you want more?
PATIENT: There's some days I'd like to have.
DOCTOR: Like to have.  Vicodin is a little stronger, have you tried Norco?
PATIENT: That's all they gave me was.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Two 60 prescriptions of 30.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Oh lets try Norco then because you weren’t taking too much Vicodin alright?
PATIENT: Well just when I really.
DOCTOR: Just when you really need it.
PATIENT: When I really need it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I just take one or two for a day or so, because with me driving a truck I can't, you know I can't take one now and then go drive.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Cause you know it puts you to sleep.
DOCTOR: Yeah have you tried Norco or no?
PATIENT: Oh I don’t even know what it is.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Maybe we can try that.  Uh and the Naproxen you take that pain medication too?
PATIENT: I'm out of that.
DOCTOR: Oh okay and then you take this two times a day?
PATIENT: Um pretty much.
DOCTOR: Or only when you need this?
PATIENT: I didn't even realize it was expired.
DOCTOR: Oh so you don't even use it then?
PATIENT: Well I use it but it's just as I need it.
DOCTOR: As you need it okay.  That's a good way to use, so you don't have to schedule this um, it's just use it like you're using right now because there's always risks in these medications and you know it makes you dizzy, the Vicodin makes you dizzy and Norco can hurt your kidneys so it's better if you don’t need it, don't take it okay um.
PATIENT: So what's the cholesterol at?
DOCTOR: Let's see cholesterol, you had it today right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I haven't looked at it yet.  I was going to see before I see you.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] so let's see 136.
PATIENT: Is that high?
DOCTOR: So let's see, so what you have your age is, how old are you?
PATIENT: 48.
DOCTOR: 48 so you're young and um 136 for you.  You don't have hypertension right?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So 136 is good for, not too bad actually.  Um I think for your goal it should be um so you're 48 and uh, do you smoke?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Ever?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So since you never smoked, your goal would be 160 for the LDL.
PATIENT: So I'm under.
DOCTOR: You're under yep so this will be fine for that.
PATIENT: So I just cut the breads out and starches and I’ll be alright.
DOCTOR: What?
PATIENT: So I just cut the potatoes out.
DOCTOR: Wait a minute, so it's your diet you're watching now right?
PATIENT: I'm trying.
DOCTOR: It's not the breads actually.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: It's the um like uh red meat, uh cholesterol, what else do eat, hamburgers?
PATIENT: Yeah.  We eat red meat.
DOCTOR: If you eat meat, there's a lot of cholesterol um, what else, what else, cheese, butter that kind of stuff.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Those are high in cholesterol I'd say.  Um otherwise if you basically if you eat like a healthy diet and you take out the fats -  okay, fish, vegetables, fruits, that's kind of stuff.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Lower cholesterol so I want you to eat those kinds of stuff.  Um so you're watching your diet?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: That's good and uh you're a exercising?
PATIENT: Not as much as I should but.
DOCTOR: Not as much as you should okay.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So you know it's hard when you have a job and all.  I can't exercise either so.
PATIENT: Well my job is just terrible you never know when you're gonna work so it's just like now.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They could call me and I'd have to be at work in two hours.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: I don't have a set schedule.
DOCTOR: You're like on call all the time?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's tough.
PATIENT: It sucks.
DOCTOR: And do they call you at night too?
PATIENT: Yeah.  They call me any time of the day every half hour, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How long do you have to work after that?
PATIENT: 14.
DOCTOR: When you don't get a call do you work 14 hours?
PATIENT: Up to 14 hours and then we'll get 10 hours off and then they call you again.
DOCTOR: Oh so you don't, you can't predict when you're working the next time?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Wow, that's a tough job.
PATIENT: Then after we do six days we get 2 1/2 days off.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So that's on that cycle where you get six days and 2 1/2 days off.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Cause like right now, this week here, is where we got messed up because I got robbed on Sunday, I tried to replace all my cards, I went to work for one day and then I didn't want to miss this so I took a sick day so it'll be next weekend before I get off again.
DOCTOR: Oh so you took a sick day for this one?
PATIENT: Yeah just so I could make, so I could make it.
DOCTOR: Oh thank you so much for coming.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: I see.  So you're, so you don't have like a protected weekend, it depends on the schedule?
PATIENT: It just depends on my schedule.  I try to get the weekend but a lot of times it's Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Thursday, Friday.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Okay and then you have, recently you had a sleep study done here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then you have the CPAP and you're using that right now?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you sleep better with that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.  Um so for today, so I didn't see any shots given to you uh in the computer.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So I was thinking you want to have like a flu shot today?
PATIENT: No I'm okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Why?
PATIENT: I don't get the flu.
DOCTOR: You never get the flu?
PATIENT: I never get the flu.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm the lucky one.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any uh, you don't know, I mean nobody's diagnosed with flu, usually it's a cold and [REDACTED] you'll be fine.
PATIENT: I don't know I just don't.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You don't think that it's worth it?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: It's free.
PATIENT: I know I just you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I come from other country and in my country you have to pay $100 for.
PATIENT: Where?
DOCTOR: I come from Japan.
PATIENT: I lived in Okinawa and Hokkaido.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: I got lost in Tokyo for a day.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah then we have the American base there [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh we did the walk up Fuji.
DOCTOR: Oh you did that, oh that's good, I want to go do that.
PATIENT: Did you do that?
DOCTOR: Oh no, no, no I can't do that.
PATIENT: I got my walking stick at home so.
DOCTOR: Did you go up into the [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah we were in the Marines, so they got a little base there.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So it's a part of your job?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: What part of Japan are you from?
DOCTOR: Uh I'm from uh a small place, Kyoto, do you know where Kyoto is?
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] parking garage where the cars go like this.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, that's all the time, that's all the time.
PATIENT: Well it's the first you know.
DOCTOR: Because you know you have land here and we have very limited land so we have to yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then the way we park, even if you don't have [REDACTED] we have the cars like, our car you have to park like this you know so you have to, cause space is very limited so you can't park like this if the wall is here, you have to park like this all the time.
PATIENT: Oh I mean yeah, Okinawa when I was there, other than they didn't have no room to park.
DOCTOR: Right, right, so that's how it is okay.  So and the other uh shot I can give you is something called Tdap, this is something to prevent tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria.
PATIENT: I just had a tetanus shot.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know you had that in 2006.
PATIENT: No I had it in 2008, I stepped on a nail.
DOCTOR: You stepped on a nail okay.
PATIENT: Cause I couldn't remember if I had one.
DOCTOR: Uh so in 2008 I think you got a tetanus shot um because you stepped on a nail.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um this one has tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, which is whooping cough.  Um sometimes you know uh it's not so popular right now but once you get it it's you have to cough a lot, you're uncomfortable, so if you can prevent it with a shot, I think you can just get a shot, so everybody below 65 we kind of have to recommend that to you so if you're interested we can give it to you.
PATIENT: Oh I'll get it next time.
DOCTOR: Next time okay.
PATIENT: Yeah. So what's up with the [REDACTED]?  Because my friend's got kind of like a cough like all the time, he just coughs.
DOCTOR: Uh I mean that's very common so I can't really tell.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: A small cough, I would say it's probably just like asthma or it probably came from a.
PATIENT: She smokes too so.
DOCTOR: Yeah smoking obviously can cause that.
PATIENT: We watched the movie Secret Agent.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Have you seen that yet?
DOCTOR: Invasion?
PATIENT: About the spread of a virus.
DOCTOR: Oh I haven't seen that yet.
PATIENT: Oh we watched it last night and then everybody in the movie who started to get sick had that little (cough, cough) and she's like oh my God I got a cold.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's a bad influence.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: It's kind of just like, did you ever seen the movie Outbreak?
DOCTOR: Uh actually no, so yeah.
PATIENT: It's about the Ebola.
DOCTOR: Ebola oh I see.
PATIENT: You know how that spreads and everything and.
DOCTOR: Wow.  Okay I need to discuss about an Advanced Directive.
PATIENT: Who?
DOCTOR: Advanced Directives like um something like Power of Attorney.
PATIENT: I have that.
DOCTOR: You do have that?
PATIENT: Yeah at home yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well I have a no resuscitate.
DOCTOR: Oh you have no resuscitate, you want to do a Do Not Resuscitate?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And why is that?
PATIENT: Uh I watched my mom and dad die and they kept trying and trying and trying and was nothing and.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Okay so if you can read this um and then you can call the number.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And give the physical papers here so that everybody would know, they'll put it in your chart and uh.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Then everyone will know that.  So the last time uh you had a fall before?
PATIENT: Yeah it was from my left ankle.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Did you just get [REDACTED] in there?
PATIENT: Well, just when I step on it the ankle comes up towards me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it gives out for a second and I just fall over.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Do you take any medication other than from the VA?
PATIENT: Aspirin.
DOCTOR: Aspirin, baby aspirin 81 mg or is it for the pain?
PATIENT: It's just uh.
DOCTOR: Do you know why you take aspirin?
PATIENT: Yeah it's just for the pain; I took it when I ran out of.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Either Advil or Tylenol.
DOCTOR: Advil, Tylenol, okay.  And you don't want [REDACTED] right?
PATIENT: [REDACTED], sleep last night.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So and your blood pressure looks okay.  Any symptoms going on?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED] cold.  How's your weight?
PATIENT: I'm heavy.
DOCTOR: You're heavy.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh but you were losing weight the time before, last year it was 330 and now it's 310.  So that's good.
PATIENT: It could be better.
DOCTOR: It could be better.  So losing weight is always better with other things.  Because it can prevent a lot of things um, maybe you've heard about diabetes, um hypertension.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And those things, once you start having it, progresses and uh it lasts [REDACTED] taken to the hospital but those [REDACTED] going to be miserable and the hypertension and diabetes progress so you know it's better to steer people away from that from the first step so that you know you don't have to worry about that later on your life.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So now you're fairly young so you're not worrying too much about that but it's always good to keep your lifestyle in good shape as far as weight, diet, exercise, those things so I would recommend that.  Um and then uh so finally can I see your feet and listen to your heart?
PATIENT: Sure.  You want the shoes off or?
DOCTOR: Yeah can you take your shoes off?
PATIENT: Both or just one?
DOCTOR: Um just your shoes and socks would be fine [REDACTED].  Do you want to pick up your medications today or?
PATIENT: No they can mail them.
DOCTOR: Can mail it okay.  So I'll give you something called Norco if you don't mind and uh every four hour tab with it [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And we [REDACTED] do that one and 90 day supply of those.  Probably if you had 120 pills, it will last for 90 days right?
PATIENT: Yeah we should go longer probably.
DOCTOR: Longer yeah and [REDACTED] here.
PATIENT: What it is like, is it like Vicodin or what?
DOCTOR: It's generally the same.  The same thing is in it um something called um, has a narcotic, low does of a narcotic and a combination of acetaminophen [REDACTED].  It's a painkiller you usually take when you have pain or something.  It can help improve pain, so Vicodin is also a combination but the narcotics they're using is slightly different so Vicodin is a little stronger than the Norco.  But I was thinking it you've never tried Norco before right?
PATIENT: No, so it's a little less Vicodin but a little more aspirin kind of?
DOCTOR: Oh let's see so it's a little bit less Vicodin and aspirin [REDACTED] pain okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright so I'll give you that.
PATIENT: It's always good when you have less.
DOCTOR: Okay, yeah.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: And uh we'll give you the Naproxen, how much are you taking?
PATIENT: Oh I don't remember.
DOCTOR: Uh 500 mg two times a day so I'll renew for one year as well.  So you take this only when you need it right?
PATIENT: That's all I take it yeah.
DOCTOR: So I think 120 pills will be okay and uh if you need a refill then let me know.  Okay so I'll examine you.  [REDACTED] back?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Where's the pain?
PATIENT: Right in the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Here?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Where it comes up, that's where it is.
DOCTOR: You  have pain here?
PATIENT: And up through there.
DOCTOR: You have a little bit of swelling here too.  Is it always like that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh like you have some fluid there?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED] okay you still want [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let me take a listen to your heart sir?  Deep breath for me please.  Take a deep breath, breathe out, once more, breathe out, once more.  Breathe out, once more, breathe out.  Good.  Open your eyes.  [REDACTED].  Stick out your tongue ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Move your tongue, good.  Okay.  So I think that's about it.  So you're doing well generally.  The only recommendation from me is that you can lose a little more weight um and I know that you have very irregular hours.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So those stressful things can cause your blood pressure to go high or get it to go high so sleep as much as possible and increase that and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that you'll feel refreshed.  I think it was good that you got the CPAP cause that will help you sleep better.
PATIENT: Oh yeah I notice a big difference using it.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  So you're not interested in prostate now.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And other things you don't need cause you're still young so and I think that's it for this trip and that's all I have.
PATIENT: So how's the iron?
DOCTOR: How is the [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: No how was the INR cause a couple years ago I had a little high iron.
DOCTOR: High iron?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh I haven't checked the iron.
PATIENT: Well [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The VA they had me have an ultrasound and said I might have a fatty liver but.
DOCTOR: You had an iron study, you had fatty liver on the ultrasound?
PATIENT: Well that's what they said but that's been years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay so I don't see an iron study here.  We haven't done iron studies here okay.  So I can recheck that, I'll call the Lab and see if they can add on to the labs we did for you this morning uh and see if we can, if we can't add it maybe you want to check it again.
PATIENT: Yeah I'll come back and take it.
DOCTOR: Yeah whenever you come back we'll check it then. (Doctor called Lab)  Well they will have iron studies with the lab this morning so I'll check the results and let you know if there's anything going on.  I think they were worried about something called hemochromatosis [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Why is that?
DOCTOR: I'm not sure, I'm not sure, I'm not sure so I think they checked an ultrasound and they were finding your iron might be a little high.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And that is something called hemochromatosis which is a disease that causes the iron to get stored excessively, not good with getting it out so you have a high level of iron so the iron was [REDACTED] usually goes into the liver, to the pancreas and it can change the color of the skin and people get diabetes.  It's called bronze diabetes.  So your skin gets a bronze color and then [REDACTED] completely so you don't have that as much and uh if they didn't say anything further then I'm not too worried about it.
PATIENT: Yeah they never said.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I just wanted to check it to see if anything has progressed with that and uh if there is any abnormal results I'll let you know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um so I need to talk to my supervisor and then I'll come back very soon okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  66:28  DOCTOR IN:  71:21)
DOCTOR: Okay sir.  So the plan remains the same.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um I'll let you know as soon as I have the lab results.  Uh so when would you like to see me next time?
PATIENT: How long should I go I mean?
DOCTOR: Uh I think for you, everything is pretty stable, so a year should fine.  But if you wanted to see me earlier you an always schedule so it's up to you.
PATIENT: Oh yeah a year is fine.
DOCTOR: A year is fine okay.
PATIENT: So my cholesterol is 138?
DOCTOR: Uh yeah it's 136.
PATIENT: And the high side is?
DOCTOR: Your goal is 160.
PATIENT: Oh so I want to stay below 160?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Below 160.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh so this is not the total cholesterol, this is the bad cholesterol.
PATIENT: It's the bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So in total cholesterol, good cholesterol and bad cholesterol are totally included so we did look at the bad cholesterol which is called LDL and that level is for you the goal is less than 160.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So this goal is different in each person.
PATIENT: You go by age?
DOCTOR: Um we go by age and we go by other things that you have.  If you have like diabetes, you need more tighter control.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: If you've ever had a heart attack, uh that takes more tighter control.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So things like that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So if you develop some medical problems then your goal is becoming lower but for now your only risk factor right now is just age.  You're older than 45 and this is counted as more risk factor.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And that's it.  You don't have hypertension and you don't have other factors.
PATIENT: Alright what is hypertension?
DOCTOR: Oh high blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: It's hypertension.
PATIENT: Oh I didn't know what it was.
DOCTOR: You know so.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I don't have it, it was all normal.
DOCTOR: Yeah, a good thing.  Okay sir, so I have nothing to offer you today.
PATIENT: Yeah that's fine.
DOCTOR: You're in good and I will just order the medication for you and they can mail it to you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay have a good time sir.  Take care.
PATIENT: Okay.  Maybe it'll be warmer next time.
DOCTOR: Yes hopefully.
PATIENT: Well this is warm for us.
DOCTOR: Next time will be one year later so it will be about the same season.
PATIENT: Oh this is hot.  Uh last year at this time we had it was the fifth worst snowstorm ever.
DOCTOR: I heard that, I heard that.
PATIENT: That was like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: Of course we had like 48 inches last year.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: We had a whole bunch.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: Have you been on Lakeshore Drive?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That was all closed.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: There were like 1600 cars stuck.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].

PATIENT: Get out, go to the subway or go some other place.
DOCTOR: They just have to leave their car there?
PATIENT: Yes, the city towed them then they found out where their car went.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: Yeah.  They [REDACTED] just you know.
DOCTOR: The city just kind of move their car?
PATIENT: They put them in a lot you know.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: I don't know how they did it, I mean they call you in a month, probably put it in a computer and show them where their car was so.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED], not me, not me.
PATIENT: Now next year's going to be a whole different story.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: Could be colder.
DOCTOR: Do you how to check out sir?  You have to check out right here sir.
