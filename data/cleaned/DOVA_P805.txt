PATIENT: [REDACTED].  What about the uh Podiatry appointment?
DOCTOR: Now I'm going to put it in but you haven't proven too successful at this point.
PATIENT: I know, you know.  I was thinking about do they have a clinic on Halsted?
DOCTOR: Well I don't know why they're not getting a hold of you.  Do you have any ideas?
PATIENT: No because uh, usually it's either on my voice mail or my son is there, one of the two and they know to give me a call.  But I have a cell phone.
DOCTOR: Did you give them that number?
PATIENT: No I didn't.
DOCTOR: Well I highly recommend it.  When you go to check out in the front you need to give them that number.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Are you having the chest pain still?
PATIENT: Yeah I haven't had any more since.  I got this again and [REDACTED] to get an appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You got to do me a favor my friend though.

DOCTOR: Yeah I'll move it, all of your stuff will be assigned to [REDACTED] also.
PATIENT: Okay.  But what happened was, I do recall missing was the eye appointment.  Now the stress test I don't know but what I be thinking is that usually, the way I know about that appointment is you just send through the mail.  You know sometimes they'll call [REDACTED] appointment, they even confirmed the eye appointment but I just got tied up for that appointment but I [REDACTED].  But the stress test I don't remember that. Maybe I should give them the other number to get in contact with.
DOCTOR: I think so.
PATIENT: But my son he be on the computer and he be playing with the video games, sometimes he don't answer the phone and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright and the liver doctors can’t do anything for you until we get all this stuff figured out.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well what am I supposed to do about my foot, [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Well you get to Podiatry.  I can't help you.  I mean there's nothing I can do for your feet okay.  Lotion is the best thing, that's all I know.  They probably need to biopsy the skin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay and give you special shoes.
PATIENT: But what I think [REDACTED] I think there's a piece of glass in my foot.
DOCTOR: That doesn't cause blisters, but I'll take a look at it.
PATIENT: Yeah because I had uh, it’s been there [REDACTED] stepped in a lot of glass [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: They're not painful right?
PATIENT: What the blisters?  Yes they are.
DOCTOR: They are.  Take them off and let me see.  I'm going to take care of your feet.  I'm more worried about your heart and your liver working so you need to survive.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: We got to get you that stress test.  Your blood pressure's too high still.
PATIENT: That's because I'm in a lot of pain with my foot.  [REDACTED] right in the middle.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh and I'll check your vitals and we'll check it in a second.
PATIENT: The blisters had on my feet [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Are you taking your blood pressure medicine?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Every single one of them?  Do you know which ones you're taking?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Which ones?
PATIENT: Name them?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh metoprolol or whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Metoprolol good.
PATIENT: And the uh lisinopril.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And uh a water pill.
DOCTOR: Hydrochlorothiazide good.
PATIENT: Yeah I tell you I wasn't taking that other one because it [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] okay that's fine.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  See I take those three.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you ever tried the Telebuddy System?
PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: Where they actually call you about your blood pressure every day and you submit it electronically?
PATIENT: No, I got a blood pressure gauge.
DOCTOR: Would you like that?
PATIENT: What for that.
DOCTOR: You take your blood pressure at home with a certain machine that submits it electronically so we get the information.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because your blood pressure has been too high for over a year and a half now.
PATIENT: It goes low once I get home.  The last time I took it at home it was about 120.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: Okay what is it running at home though?
PATIENT: Uh for the last uh month or so it's been running like about 129/80, in the lower 80s something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay well then I think it'd be good to have you have blood pressures at home then.  Look at ours, every single one that we have here.
PATIENT: I think I be, it's a little more stressful for me to come up here.
DOCTOR: I'm sure it is.  I'm a stressful person.
PATIENT: (Laughter).
DOCTOR: Well see we've only got these here.  That’s why I think it'd good for you to have one of those Telebuddy Systems then we'd know what your blood pressure is at home.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause you're right, your blood pressure may be better at home but I can't know that until we check it at home and I find out the answer okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So let's try that alright.  Alright, you also need to be on a cholesterol medicine that we need to add today.
PATIENT: Cholesterol.
DOCTOR: Your cholesterol is too high.  Your bad cholesterol we want for you less than 70 and yours is 134.  We need to cut your cholesterol in half okay.  And for that reason, I think you need to go on Zocor or Lipitor which is a cholesterol medicine alrighty.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You're African-American; you're almost 60 years old.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You have hypertension and diabetes so right there those are four.
PATIENT: Hepatitis C.
DOCTOR: What, well hepatitis C is pretty much equivalent to diabetes, in my mind it is diabetes okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You have four things okay that would put you at risk for heart attacks.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Which will now give you five with high cholesterol so all of these things we need to treat.  We're trying to treat your blood pressure, we can't change your race, we change your age okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But we can change your cholesterol.
PATIENT: So what was that pill I was on.
DOCTOR: The cholesterol.
PATIENT: I know, I understand, what kind of side effects is there?
DOCTOR: Side effects, the only kind of side effects is it might cause a little bit of muscle ache, so it's the most prescribed pills in America, is Lipitor.
PATIENT: Yeah I've heard that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  That’s because it saves lives.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we'll put you on a low dose and increase it as you need it.
PATIENT: Alright.

PATIENT: Yeah I know.
DOCTOR: I've been working at it my friend.
PATIENT: Congratulations.
DOCTOR: Well no on you.
PATIENT: (Laughter).
DOCTOR: I'd like to feel a little bit better about you.  Alright, we're going to need to set up with this Telebuddy System okay.  You need a stress test; we need the Eye Clinic and the Foot Clinic.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then we need to make a liver appointment after we get the stress test done.

DOCTOR: Okay well they just need to get you some special um orthotics.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's the only thing [REDACTED].  These are rubbing blisters.
PATIENT: Are they?
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean they look very much like rubbing blisters to me.  Okay.  It's possible though that it's chronic inflammation because you're rubbing like this.  That may feel better if you pop it a little bit.
