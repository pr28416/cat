DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: I didn't know if I had the name correct.  How are you?
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: We haven't seen you in a while huh?  And how are you holding up?
Good.  Alright how you been?  Any problems since the last time I saw you?  Alright no [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I came over here.
DOCTOR: What?
PATIENT: I said the only is [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright. Um you haven't been here since November that's okay I think I said six months right, so close enough.  Um no more clots?  No more blood clots?
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: As far as you know.  No swelling in your legs or anything like that?
PATIENT: Maybe a little bit of swelling and I keep the compression on it.  If anything it might have collected.  It's just the thing that nothing has really been unavailable, no major swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh any shortness of breath, trouble breathing, anything like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Alright cool.  Uh you saw the Hem/Onc doctors again so that's great.  We ran some tests so you might have one, you know the gene mutations you can have, I don't know if they talked to you about those.
PATIENT: Now I know that you wanted me to go there just because there's a treatment situation.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I don't know what came of it because.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah well basically what they, what they said was you know there were a few genetic tests that we can do.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: To see if you have a mutation, when some of the genes are clotting genes.  Um there's a few that are the most common, yours have two, well kind of 1 1/2.  You have one definite mutation that um makes you clot more.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And one mutation that's kind of iffy. The test was kind of what's in between basically where it's not you completely have or you completely don't it's somewhere in the grey zone.  Um but nevertheless you've had clots before.  You had these tests.  You need to be on dalteparin all the time okay.  You kind uh because of all the stuff you've had.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Kind of bought yourself lifelong dalteparin shots.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Which is better than getting a big, big blood clot in your lungs right and you know.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So then yeah because you know eventually if you don't take them what could happen would be maybe a big blood clot and it could either be like you know.  You see people who smoke.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Like when old people that smoke what you see and they're on oxygen and all that stuff.  Same thing could happen.  You know basically what happens is if you lose a part of your lung um and then you require all this extra oxygen cause it makes it hard to walk, do things.  Worse obviously, the worst case scenario is you could die from a blood clot with this if it goes in your lungs and stops you from like getting oxygen okay.  You need to be, that's basically their recommendation was you should have it every day.  Are you still having, are you taking those still or are you off?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I need refills of the meds, that's why I was here; I had an issue with the prescription where they didn't want to give me the appropriate.  They gave me some to go home with then they were supposed to mail it to me.  I never got it in the mail.  I talked to the pharmacist to try and validate what I was supposed to get, all those boxes [REDACTED] so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then he tried to say it was my fault because I didn't sit and wait for some of it.  I was told that it was going to be mailed it to me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So, Iâ€™m just going to sit and wait today to get it.
DOCTOR: Okay, sounds good.  I was gonna say we'll do that and make sure we refill it.  I'll give you 30 days, oh yeah 30 days is one of the things we do and then we'll do eight refills okay.  You should have some way more than enough okay.  And I could see you back here in nine months okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
