PATIENT: Because I had a little blood in my urine.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's why I went there for them to you know, but that hurt and uh see that prostate I had a stent years ago cause the urologist that I saw here, he was very attentive to me and stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And you know because my dad had prostate cancer and one of my brothers.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's why I really concerned about it now you know then when I hear about this thing with the sleep apnea this morning, I hadn't heard that before.  I knew I was coming to see you so I just asking you about it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I mean since you saw DOCTOR, since you saw me last time.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We talked about sleep apnea and you went to Urgent Clinic.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And they talked to you about it also, is that right?
PATIENT:
DOCTOR: 't talk to me about nothing cause she didn't even acknowledge me but uh we just talked and uh that was it.  I think she made an appointment, she was supposed to make an appointment with those people for my uh, for discussing about uh.
DOCTOR: The sleep apnea?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: The neurologist?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think I keep, cause I know she give me some papers.
DOCTOR: Okay.

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then I need to go back and see those people out at Hines.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: About my.
DOCTOR: It's been a while yeah because we talked about that last time.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So what happened?
PATIENT: Well they never called me and he didn't get no appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I called out there, several times.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because I figured that's what, see this numbness is still in my finger, both of them.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh I can live with that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But you know when it come to my prostate and the sleep apnea now that's something to be really concerned about.
DOCTOR: Okay what about the sleep apnea concerns you so much, tell me?
PATIENT: Because I uh, this new concern developing here now I wake up and I'll be coughing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know not gasping for air.  I'm not short; you know I don't feel like I'm short of breath.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I spits up and stuff.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now I'm laying awake.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Are you wearing the mask?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I just got a new one.  I get one every three months.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh but I'm having a problem.  Here is my problem with that mask, trying to make those adjustments with the straps.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because I can't feel them.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: See, I can't feel it, you know some of them go like this and you put.  The one I got just come across here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I mean well except this one comes across like that.
DOCTOR: Is that one of the small ones.
PATIENT: Yeah the small one.
DOCTOR: Is that the one you're using?
PATIENT: And I had a full face one.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: When I first started.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: But look like the rubber uh began to get soft.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know it wasn't fitting properly.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And by me with this numbness I can't make that adjustment with those straps.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I figured they might be coming out with something new.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I got the newer type I think.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Right now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But uh that's very important with that [REDACTED], because my oxygen you know I don't get it.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I'm getting it but.
DOCTOR: Right.  No it's great you're using it because if you have sleep apnea you have to use the mask.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Whether it's the nose mask or the face mask, you know this is fine, it works.
PATIENT: I sleep in it every night.
DOCTOR: It works very well.  Yeah uh-huh.
PATIENT: I put it on every night.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because I had a lot of my friends, associates, they swear by that.  I don't want to get like that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Which it may require their life to change.
DOCTOR: So you have to give it some time okay.  Give it some time of consistent use and it gets better.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: People say that once they start using it.
PATIENT: They don't want to stop.
DOCTOR: They don't want to stop.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But it takes some time to get used to sleeping like that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: See I get that feedback from those guys and that's where I want to be.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  You will be, just give it some time cause it takes some time to make sure we have the right adjustment.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You know for the mask and for you to get comfortable with it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh what other concerns do you have besides the sleep apnea, regarding sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Well uh it was that my prostate like I said and I haven't had a complete physical.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Since my other doctor left.
DOCTOR: Okay what do you mean, what do you mean?
PATIENT: You know they check you for sugar and uh all that.
DOCTOR: For blood work yeah.  We had ordered some blood work.
PATIENT: I ain't had none of that I.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: I ain't had nothing like that and that's what you know uh, I don't think the prostate test maybe twice a year or something maybe or once.
DOCTOR: Okay so in February we had ordered some blood tests the routine physical tests.  You know things that we check every year; you know cholesterol and prostate number and things like that um.
PATIENT: But I never got the results.
DOCTOR: Yeah well I don't think it was drawn cause it's still pending it says so maybe today after this appointment.  Have you eaten anything this morning?
PATIENT: Not yet.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you can just go to the Lab and get all these blood tests done.
PATIENT: Please I be glad to get that.
DOCTOR: Yeah absolutely.
PATIENT: Yeah.  You think they could check me for sugar?
DOCTOR: Yeah uh-huh.  We'll check the sugar test with it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then your prostate number I think it was checked in December, this past December and it looked pretty good.  Are you having any problems with urination?
PATIENT: No other than I'm getting up.  I'm going about three times a night now.  I used to go two.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh but I drink a lot of water anyway.
DOCTOR: Do you drink water before going to bed?
PATIENT: Yes and I think that could be you know the reason.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I have uh, my bladder empties I mean cause the flow is strong.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know and uh.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry you said it does flow strong right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Depending on my consumption of water I guess during the day, when I'm sitting around or whatever.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'm pretty active.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know and but the only problem I got though doctor here is that sleep.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I think a lot of that brings on, the not sleeping, good sleep, brings on other problems.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause I have a tremendous appetite.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I eat the proper foods and I eat a lot of fruit, oranges and apples.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: And how's constipation?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Constipation, how is that?  Are you moving your bowels?
PATIENT: Well I'm going.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know I take that tablet that you give me uh, that little brown round one.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I take that sometimes.  But if I miss a day or two without going I'm not too worried about it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I will pop that tablet.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh my constipation really it bother me cause I'm not going like I was when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know I know that, I can accept some things.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I the waste is not a hard, straining.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Type of a finish.
DOCTOR: So that's good right.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm just used to being healthy you know and stuff and not having to live with some situation because I am getting older but I still want to stay around a little while longer.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I'm not doing anything to hurt my heart you know.
DOCTOR: Oh no you're not.  You're doing everything right.  The only couple of things I need you to do is follow up with the neurosurgeon.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Because you have pretty bad arthritis in your neck.
PATIENT: Yeah I do.
DOCTOR: Impinging on some of the nerves okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I don't know if the shaking is because of that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So it seems that Neurology had seen you and they wanted you to go see the neurosurgeons and just talk to them.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It doesn't mean you're committed to surgery.  You talk to them and find out what they have to offer.
PATIENT: That's what I will do.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So that's at the Hines VA okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The other thing um and you need to go back and see the neurologist.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Not the urologist, not the prostate doctors, the neurologist.  He is the doctor that actually initially referred you to Hines okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But this time we need to talk to them about the balance and also the shaking and see if they have anything else to offer okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um we'll check some of the lab work um and let me talk to DOCTOR and see what we can do about sleeping.
PATIENT: Yeah.

PATIENT: Yeah that really bother me that sleep.  And those tablets that I have those supposed to make me rest a little better?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I ain't got no more.
DOCTOR: When you had them were you taking them?
PATIENT: Well um not consistently uh.  She didn't, when they give them to me it was something just to aid, it wasn't nothing I don't think, they didn't tell me to continuously take them.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I know I'm out of them and uh it wasn't a harsh type of a tablet that would put you into a deep sleep or nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Uh uh.
PATIENT: And uh and I but I just want, if I could just go to you know get yawn, you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I feel the sleep coming on.

PATIENT: You know ready cause I love to sleep.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I really do.  I put all those years in the steel mill but that's all I did.  I worked, come home, ate, went to bed you know something like that but it was a pattern and everything was normal then.  You know you ate a good breakfast, you went to work, you stayed eight hours and come home uh did some stuff you know and then you eat your supper.
DOCTOR: When did you stop working?

PATIENT: It's that heavy stuff, crack and all that is what.  I don't even go on that one but I'm just saying and you know I haven't done that since the Army.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh occasionally you know when I was young and stuff but I never seamed and then you hear rumors that you know you smoke a little pot and it'll help your eyesight and this and that and got me wearing glasses so you know.
DOCTOR: It helps, you know in California it's legalized.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: For glaucoma.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But I didn't see over here that you have documented glaucoma.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: It doesn't help vision as such.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But if somebody has glaucoma then it can help the glaucoma.
PATIENT: But uh I don't have to have it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I don't look for it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or nothing like that uh and that's not a whole joint.  I'm talking about maybe three or four people.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay, alright.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Now let me ask you about your heart a little bit more.  When you walk around, let say if you walk a flight of stairs or walk a couple blocks do you feel any pain?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: No okay.
PATIENT: See when I work out in my gym on the treadmill.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And stuff you know I don't feel tired, sometimes I work up a sweat but I gauge myself.

DOCTOR: Okay.  Any um, I know you sweat because you're working out.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But what about just going up a flight of stairs and something do you feel like.
PATIENT: No sweat.  No sweating or nothing.  The only thing right now about me going up my steps now and coming down them I hurt in my legs.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know right in here.  You know I got varicose veins true enough uh if I'm carrying something I do feel kind of weak in the legs I go you know but this wasn't nothing compared to this.  Sometimes you know my sleep apnea but um my balance, like I say when I talked to him or whatever I was gonna discuss that with him.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But uh that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know uh I don't have no problem eating uh something like I don't have to have coffee.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh but I will drink a cup of tea or something uh.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Every now and then. In my class they told me don't drink nothing with caffeine after six.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Stuff like that, I follow the rules.
DOCTOR: You follow everything okay, excellent.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So that's all of your concerns okay.  So like I said see I have to talk to DOCTOR and see what other ideas we can come up with.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So maybe you should try that medication again, the trazodone, to see if that might help you.  You have to take it before you go to bed.
PATIENT: Yeah and you want me to take that every night?
DOCTOR: Yeah uh-huh.  Let me talk to DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Yeah, you just tell her, well she's honest with me and all that.
DOCTOR: Yeah, sure, absolutely, absolutely.
PATIENT: I know she's concerned.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: About me and my health but I think if I could sleep.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'd be a much better person if I could sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We're gonna try to help you with sleep okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And your sleep apnea, you're using the machine.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Give it some time and you'll get used to it okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we'll see how things go.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: Can I bring, I can bring that, now cause see I want to make, no one ever fitted that mask on me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now the matter with me I can't grasp those straps.  This new mask they give me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well she adjusted it up there but I puts it on intact.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And pull it down.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know and then it rests right here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I can do it like that.
DOCTOR: Can somebody help you with the mask?
PATIENT: Yeah my wife, when she's there.
DOCTOR: If it's hard to put it on.
PATIENT: It's hard by myself.
DOCTOR: Then you can put it on like this and strap it around.
PATIENT: See if I put, leave that one strap open.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then you know.
DOCTOR: Just put it on.
PATIENT: Yeah and then use that one strap.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Kind of like this new type I got there's two straps.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: For this one.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Now do you go to the Equipment Clinic?
PATIENT: No that's where I got it from here.
DOCTOR: Yeah uh-huh.
PATIENT: But nobody showed, she showed me this last time the one that I got but when I went to the class I spent the night out here for observation and they found out that I stopped breathing a couple of times and all that good stuff so after I went to pick up the equipment no one showed me how to put that thing on.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The mask.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And the lady who did I didn't understand her English.  She didn't, I couldn't understand what she was saying.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I was just stuck with something.
DOCTOR: Where was that lady?  Was she in the clinic?
PATIENT: She was in the, she was issuing the equipment.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So maybe we need to go back with them.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh cause they're the ones who would do the adjustment for you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so why don't you bring your mask back, go back to them and maybe speak with someone else.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Not that person.
PATIENT: Because see I, just like this behind me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The head, you see mine comes across the forehead.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Too.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But my hose connect and that is the one that comes across the forehead.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I love that one.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know but I'm getting it balled up behind the head back here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I think it's the thing just behind the head.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now thatâ€™s a good fit if I could get mine to do that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, no they can help you.  That's just the adjustment that needs to happen okay.
PATIENT: Yeah but sometimes.
DOCTOR: Just give it a little bit of time to come up with the mask that's appropriate for you.
PATIENT: Cause sometimes in the night you know you toss and turn and that hose and the straps twist and it's a mess.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah it's uncomfortable.
PATIENT: But the other than that, I think I'm getting a good enough fit during the night.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because I could see the water in my machine is leaving.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And my little calendar that's a data sheet I check it.  I got to find out when I was supposed to bring it back here in three months.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So they can tell if it's effective or something like that.
DOCTOR: Find out yeah.
PATIENT: So I'm gonna do that uh when I come back.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: On one of those thingse here.
DOCTOR: So we'll work on getting that mask fitted to you appropriately and I think that'll help you sleep also.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  As far as your prostate is concerned, you know your prostate number was checked recently, within the year and it looked okay.  You didn't tell me very significant urinary complaints but we can have you see the urologist again.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you want to doctors?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then we'll take it from there.  What we'll do today is check your urine.  Okay one more time just make sure there's no blood in it.
PATIENT: Okay, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then you talked about your heart.  You know the symptoms you're telling me it seems like you have a good heart that's working pretty good okay.  Um maybe it is related to not sleeping very well with the sleep apnea symptoms okay.  Right now I'm gonna keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and then we talked about constipation.  Constipation you're gonna continue using the tablet that you're taking.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The Docusate, continue eating all the foods that you are eating cause all that helps keep your stools soft and you know so you can move your bowel.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  I do eat a lot of yogurt too.
DOCTOR: Yeah uh-huh.  Alright.  Is that everything?
PATIENT: That's about it uh you know because I'm gonna get these tests you see, the blood work that'll tell you some stuff and I'm just concerned about my prostate but believe if I can, if I can sleep.
DOCTOR: Everything would be better.
PATIENT: Four full hours, three hours or four of good sleep I'd be a better person.
