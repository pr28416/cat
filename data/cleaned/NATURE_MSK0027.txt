DOCTOR: OK, and. Are you seeing any muscle atrophy or any joint deformity or or malalignment?

DOCTOR: OK, and any skin changes over the elbow?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Alright Ann. If you were to press over various portions of the elbow, are there any areas that cause pain like the lateral side, medial side, or anterior posterior?

DOCTOR: OK, and um is there any pain with with movement?
PATIENT: Yes. Whenever I tried to bend it or straighten it out all the way she she complaints of pain.
DOCTOR: OK, how about moving the rest or shoulder?
PATIENT: No, that's fine.
DOCTOR: OK, so that that was everything that I wanted to ask about and and look for on the physical today. Did you have anything else that perhaps I forgot to mention that might be important?
PATIENT: Uhm no that was kind of it, I just was wondering how we can fix her elbow.
DOCTOR: I yeah certainly so. It will be so when I get an elbow X Ray. And. But typically to fix this type of injury, so currently I'm thinking this could be a like a radial head subluxation, and possibly a radial head fracture, but most likely I radial head subluxation, where there's a mechanism of pulling on a child's arm. And it's just that the what could happen is the part of the radius, which is that a forearm bone can pull out of the ligament that's holding it down.
PATIENT: OK.
DOCTOR: An just because of the structures there, not yet fully matured and strong, and somebody who's that young. And so it will cause pain reduced range of motion at the elbow and you won't really see much swelling or redness, and with just the physical exam maneuver you can reduce it and then put the head of the radius back into place and things will be usually back to back to normal. But if there is a fracture which will look for an X-Ray then there the pain might be last a little bit longer, but immobilization of the arm is not required and most kids will regain full mobility in in a short time after the reduction.
PATIENT: OK, that sounds good, thank you.
