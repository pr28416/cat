PATIENT: Okay yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um it's a tough thing to treat, I'll just tell you.  It's a tough thing to treat because there isn't a good surgery for this.

PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now, PATIENT let's talk about the chest pain.
PATIENT: Okay good.
DOCTOR: Okay because the chest pain is not from your heart.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Well you've got an aneurysm but that that doesn't cause chest pain.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We're gonna continue to monitor that.
PATIENT: Okay.

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um but there's nothing to do right now.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And that's not the cause of this pain.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So but you're still having pain.  I believe you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we've got to figure out what.
PATIENT: What it is?
DOCTOR: Uh what is that pain and what can we do about it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now I need you to think really hard.  Does the pain that you get in the chest is it ever related to food ever?

PATIENT: Let me tell you what it is.  Sharp pain.
DOCTOR: It's sharp pain.
PATIENT: Right in here.
DOCTOR: And how long does it last?
PATIENT: Well sometimes it lasts four, five hours.  Sometimes it can come [REDACTED] it will cause me to take aspirin every once in a while.  I took them up but it still hurts.  The aspirin don't do anything you know, like when I'm just about really go do it, [REDACTED]stronger than that, you know what I'm saying.
DOCTOR: You don't okay.  Um not, no spicy foods, it makes this worse?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Coffee.

DOCTOR: Uh cocaine, marijuana anything [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No, that stuff will kill me.  No.
DOCTOR: No, no.
PATIENT: When I was a kid I used to have marijuana you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Ever since I was over 21, [REDACTED] I'm not like that no more.

PATIENT: Oh man.
DOCTOR: And I'll have you move your shoulder; I want you to go out like this.  Go up and as far as you can go.  Does that cause pain?
PATIENT: Yeah and it's got me coughing too.
DOCTOR: That causes pain right there?
PATIENT: A sharp pain right over here.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Now I want you to go forward, I want you to go up.
PATIENT: Going up.
DOCTOR: Does that cause the pain?
PATIENT: A little pain, but not much.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well.
PATIENT: It sure is not gas was it.
DOCTOR: No I think it's a muscle.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: That, just doing that motion and it causes pain.
PATIENT: No not this one over here does.
DOCTOR: That one over there?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.  Um what do you do with that arm?

DOCTOR: Okay.  If it persists then maybe it is something like gas.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But I'm not gonna give you another medicine right now cause I'm less suspicious that this is gas.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I'm more suspicious that this is a muscle.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I do think it might be worth getting a picture of the knee just to see that there isn't anything that is really abnormal and to see if this could be osteoarthritis.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and again this has been a long term pain issue for you.
PATIENT: Right this has been long term.

DOCTOR: Okay and does that help?

PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Um there are medicines that are available that you can take once the headache starts.

PATIENT: And I hate to tell you this but before you gave me some Viagra.
DOCTOR: Yeah.

DOCTOR: I didn't give you just one.  Now listen the VA restricts me.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm only allowed to give you two pills a month.  If it was only one that was a mistake.  It was meant to be two.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um but the issue, here I'm changing this right now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um I don't know why the VA does this.  You know you were in the Army you know or some service and now they want to control every part of your life.  I don't know what the story is behind that but they only let me prescribe two pills a month.
PATIENT: I only got one.  Now you see what I'm saying, one pill.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: One pill, one pill you know get your girlfriend or something, you know what I mean and she want to do some more.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay my friend.  Um when I look at this uh the medicine that I was thinking I wanted to give you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It turns out I can only give to you if I'm a neurologist.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Well is the fact that [REDACTED] well you the doctor, [REDACTED] what do you think about that?
DOCTOR: We talked about that.  They want to monitor that in a year.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: There's nothing to do.  There's no problem related to your heart.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You're heart's healthy but you do have a little bit of dilation of the aorta.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And there's nothing to do about it.  We're just gonna monitor it.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: To make sure that it doesn't, if it gets bigger, eventually you might have to have a surgery.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But right now there isn't any indication to have to do that okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I can uh you know, I can refer you to the neurologist.
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: For the headache and they can prescribe you the medicine for, specific for migraines.  From the sound of it, it could be migraines.
PATIENT: Hmm.  Let's hope it is cause I don't want to take [REDACTED].  I can't come over here, I got to stay all the way.
DOCTOR: Right, right, right [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Hospital [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You're not taking the right medicine for migraine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I want to give you something but the VA is limiting me.  I can't give you this medicine unless I'm a neurologist so I can send you to the neurologist and they can assess your headaches.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And see if they will do it.
PATIENT: Alright, alright, alright, alright.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  So that's what we'll do.
