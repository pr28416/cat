PATIENT: I think it was two years ago.
DOCTOR: I see, and um do you remember if the LDL was normal at that time?
PATIENT: Ah yes it was normal.
DOCTOR: OK, but since the, it was about two years ago, it might be worthwhile today just to also check a lipid panel just to be safe, but that'll be something we can talk about that more so at the end if that's OK.

PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: OK, and how about is there anybody at work?
PATIENT: At work no. No one's been sick.
DOCTOR: OK, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: We went up to we just went to um like a, we went on a hiking trail that was outside the city recently and there were a lot of people there and and we weren't wearing masks, but we, it seemed like we were keeping a good distance between each other so that that would be my only concern.
DOCTOR: OK for sure. Were people pretty close to each other on the paths when walking by on the hike?
PATIENT: Ahh not like the whole time, but there would be times when you know people just kind of brushed by you to try to get ahead of you or something like that.
DOCTOR: I see OK. And do you smoke cigarettes?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Um, do you smoke marijuana?
PATIENT: Um no.
DOCTOR: OK, and do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: I don't.
DOCTOR: Do you use any other recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Um no.
DOCTOR: OK, so that was all I wanted to ask about. Oh, actually one thing that I I did want to, I forgot to ask was, do you have any neck stiffness?
PATIENT: No, not that I noticed.
DOCTOR: OK. So that was the last question that I wanted to ask about. Was there anything that you wanted to tell me that I I maybe forgot?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered it all.  I'm just wondering do you? Do you think it's COVID or something else?
DOCTOR: Well, it's definitely a possibility with the symptoms that you're having, since they can be so non- specific for covid it can be a lot of symptoms that overlap. So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations.
PATIENT: OK great, thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, you're welcome. We'll get those started.
PATIENT: OK, sounds great.
