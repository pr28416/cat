DOCTOR: Hi.
PATIENT: I haven't seen you in so long I almost didn't recognize you.
DOCTOR: Okay in here.  Anything bothering you now?
PATIENT: The word's no, nothing.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I did my blood work.
DOCTOR: Yeah I saw that.
PATIENT: She had a hard time getting my blood today too.
DOCTOR: Really actually it looks pretty good.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh except your hemoglobin A1c went up a touch, it's 6.1, it was in the 5's previously.  Um but that could also be maybe cause um you've been eating more sweets lately or anything like that.
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: Have you been eating more sweets lately?
PATIENT: Not really.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It went up a touch.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: It's not, the other time.
PATIENT: The only thing I eat that's sweet is yogurt.
DOCTOR: Okay I'm not really all that concerned.
PATIENT: Really that's all; no I don't eat sweets too much.
DOCTOR: Well I saw that you called yesterday.  I didn't call you back knowing that you were going to be in clinic today okay.  Um so I know that the urology people called you about what they found right from the biopsy
PATIENT: I don't understand it.  I got a copy of this report.
DOCTOR: Yeah so.
PATIENT: Did you get that?  You get that?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh you know okay.
DOCTOR: So basically they did the biopsy.  They don't think its cancer yet but they did find, so keep in mind prostate cancer is one of those things that is very slow growing.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: And the likelihood of somebody passing away from prostate cancer, even if they have it, is low.  They will probably pass away of whatever else is affecting them.  So even though you, so it's kind of like someone let's say if you have high blood pressure but then you have diabetes, the chances are you're gonna die of a complication from diabetes than from high blood pressure.
PATIENT: What do they call cancer, what's the term for?
DOCTOR: Adenocarcinoma.
PATIENT: Oh that's what that means oh.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: I seen it in the report twice, that's all.
DOCTOR: Yeah it just means adenocarcinoma it's just describing the type of cancer.  That's a glandular cancer that the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: So basically I'm kind of stable?
DOCTOR: Well.
PATIENT: Or a little bit higher.
DOCTOR: It's found, I think what they're trying to describe.  It's a little weird cause they usually say yes it is cancer or no it is not cancer but then they wrote suspicious for so I think they found like a collection of cells that might be heading the cancer route.  Like the way they organize themselves is different from normal tissue so if you have normal tissue or something in between the grey zone and then cancer tissue.  I think they found something that was in the grey zone.  Okay so that's why they wanted to repeat a biopsy in a year and to see.
PATIENT: She told me, now usually I come every July.
DOCTOR: Hmm?
PATIENT: They told me when I left that I'm gonna come back in December.
DOCTOR: In December, let me see what they said.
PATIENT: I didn't, I didn't say nothing but I just figured well.
DOCTOR: No that's fine.  Will need repeat biopsy in one year with another PSA.
PATIENT: That's what I usually get every year, same month, July always.
DOCTOR: So you always get biopsies done?  Of the prostate, you have done because of the high PSA right?  Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So remind me around December 10 next time you see me so [REDACTED] because if you are doing every six months.  Remind me that Urology hasn't called me back um but they told you six months over the phone?
PATIENT: No they told me when I was leaving the clinic.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I don't really know.
DOCTOR: They told you six months though.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: That's what they told you.  Okay that's fine so in December, the winter time, go we'll ask them that question.  Hey you told us we could come back in six months, your note says to me what is it and then at that time we’ll address it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So remind me about that.
PATIENT: You ordered me to have um liver biopsy.
DOCTOR: I didn't order it but somebody did.
PATIENT: Somebody did right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Did they do it yet?
PATIENT: They cancelled it.
DOCTOR: Why?
PATIENT: Because when I went in there I couldn't remember when's the last time I took any aspirin so because I wasn't sure exactly they didn't want to take the chance.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I called them and asked them to reschedule.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But they have yet.
DOCTOR: Call them again cause I can't do anything more than have you reschedule it.
PATIENT: Is that important?
DOCTOR: Hmm?
PATIENT: Is it really important or what?
DOCTOR: No but they're just trying to see.  The reason why we sent you is the hematology, the blood doctors, because your platelets were low.
PATIENT: Right I remember now.
DOCTOR: Let's see today, they're still low so, they're still low so we're trying to find the cause of that and so they found that your spleen was big.  Lots of times when people's spleens are big then they also have low platelets cause the spleen sequesters all the, eats up all the platelets okay.  But then we'll wonder why the spleen's big and why is that, why is it doing that so then they found that the liver was big also.  And usually then the liver's big then the spleen gets bigger too.
PATIENT: The spleen's over here right?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Spleen's on that side, liver's on this side.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And they're all connected.
PATIENT: But this used to hurt bad sometimes.
DOCTOR: When?
PATIENT: Over the last few years.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And you know what they told me.
DOCTOR: What.
PATIENT: Oh that's just scar tissue.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I mean that could be scar tissue.  But your spleen is actually like way up here, it's like way up here.
PATIENT: Yeah right.
DOCTOR: It's not down here, its way up here near your ribcage and so then they're well you've got, you have fatty liver.  Why do you have fatty liver and you have a history of drinking so it could be related to that.
PATIENT: I really don't.  The drinking's so far back I mean.
DOCTOR: I know, I know but that can still do it.  It doesn't matter when you drink it can still do it.  So then that's why they're just trying to find the cause of it.  It's nothing that needs to happen urgently but that should happen at some point within the next year.  I think before 2012 was over I'd try to get the biopsy done okay.
PATIENT: I had to call you for the appointment right?
DOCTOR: No you call the GI Lab, the GI doctor.
PATIENT: Not originally.
DOCTOR: Huh?
PATIENT: They sent me a letter that I had to call and set up the appointment with you and I called back and said well yeah you're supposed.
DOCTOR: To have an appointment with me?
PATIENT: Yeah your.
DOCTOR: Or you need me to make that appointment.
PATIENT: No me?  They said make it.
DOCTOR: That's fine that you're seeing me.  You're here.
PATIENT: That's what I did.
DOCTOR: You're just here for your follow-up.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: But that's something separate.  The liver thing is completely different.
PATIENT: No I know that, I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about this.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: How I ended up here today.
DOCTOR: No that's fine.  That's how they're doing it these days.
PATIENT: Yeah right that's what's she told me.
DOCTOR: They just sent you a letter and then you call in to make the appointment.  So I suggest you, whoever you called to schedule it in the first place, the liver biopsy, call them and be like okay I'm not taking my aspirin or tell me when I should be scheduled.
PATIENT: Well I thought, that's why I thought you scheduled.  I didn't schedule that.
DOCTOR: I didn't schedule the liver biopsy but.
PATIENT: After you met me that time.
DOCTOR: The liver doctors.
PATIENT: I had all that stuff come up, those appointments.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know and uh.
DOCTOR: The liver doctor scheduled it for you.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So what you can do, you can go up to the GI people, the GI Lab right now, to the 13th floor after your done and go like I was supposed to be scheduled for a liver biopsy, it was cancelled because I was still on aspirin but my doctor would like me to reschedule it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If not, if they say no you need to see the doctor then tell them to make an appointment with the liver doctor that you saw okay in clinic and then they'll.
PATIENT: But I never saw a doctor.
DOCTOR: Sure you did.
PATIENT: I did?
DOCTOR: Yes you did.
PATIENT: I saw one of your.
DOCTOR: There's a note right here.
PATIENT: I saw an Indian doctor.  I don't know, no he wasn't a doctor.  He was more of a nurse type guy.
DOCTOR: No you saw a doctor.
PATIENT: He was a doctor?
DOCTOR: He was an Asian guy yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: He was a middle Asian guy, he's a doc, he's a GI fellow.
PATIENT: Oh really.
DOCTOR: So he saw you and so he.
PATIENT: He didn’t have a white coat on.
DOCTOR: That doesn't mean anything.  So yeah he saw you and he's the one who scheduled it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you have to go back up to the 13th floor and be like hey I need to see the person's name.  It's a common last name but I never know how to pronounce it.
PATIENT: What, say it?
DOCTOR: I think its DOCTOR is actually how you really say it but if you were to say it phonetically it's DOCTOR or something like that.  DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR:
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: You donna ask me about how my uh acupuncture went?
DOCTOR: Yeah, I just read that note.
PATIENT: It was amazing.
DOCTOR: How'd it go, really?
PATIENT: Now the first time DOCTOR oh she's fascinating.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: I thought she was hooked up with the guy on TV.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: But no anyway, she got worried because of my pacemaker.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I got cleared.  Well she went and did it but once she got me clear.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The next time I come back she hit me with all the juice they had in that baby.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Whoa that was a wake-up call.  But she said now she's gonna do it every other month instead of every month.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I feel better, really a lot better.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And what wasn't supposed to be affected by it was my knee and that got really better.
DOCTOR: Good, I'm really happy for you.
PATIENT: Unbelievable.  I don't know how it, you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My shoulder got better which was what, you know the arthritis part but the knee and she hooked up the needles with the electricity transmitters and I said how much power are you putting in that sucker, my knee feels like it's coming apart?  She said that now that I know you're cleared from the pacemaker I'm gonna hook you up with the juice.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh it's only 20 minutes yeah.
DOCTOR: That's good.
PATIENT: Yeah, it's cool yeah.  If you get pain and you get a gain it's good.
DOCTOR: Let me [REDACTED] I think I need acupuncture.  My [REDACTED] has been hurting me the last two days.  I didn't even sleep last night.  [REDACTED].  Okay um.  So I wrote in my note about the six months versus one year so that [REDACTED] remember I have it [REDACTED].  Um okay so no more knee pain huh?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Good.  All because of the acupuncture?
PATIENT: It’s gotta be.  Cause I really had, you know I mean I had some of the you know Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And stuff but you know I mean they was helping it but, that really helped it like right away the next day.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I felt it you know.  But she said the good thing about your situation she said I could exercise six days a week.
DOCTOR: Yeah that was true.
PATIENT: For two hours a day you know, all the leg did and all this.  She said that's what makes yours work better for you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because of the constant daily exercise so acupuncture with exercise works good right now so.  That's a cool science that they did.  Watching her doing it is just amazing.
DOCTOR: No chest pain, shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: No changes in your medications recently, right?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Pain reliever[REDACTED] pacemaker changed, right?
PATIENT: They did it already.

PATIENT: Yeah right.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It was a month ago, within the last month.
DOCTOR: Is it a battery that they changed?
PATIENT: I don't know if they replaced it or not.  I think they replaced it.
DOCTOR: Let's see.  They changed the [REDACTED].  Okay.  And then your cholesterol is good, that's good and you're still taking the same meds or have they changed those around for you?
PATIENT: For what?
DOCTOR: The cholesterol medications.
PATIENT: Who?
DOCTOR: The cholesterol medications.
PATIENT: Oh no that's all the same, that's all the same yeah.
DOCTOR: And you're still following in the Lipid Clinic?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Well I haven't been there in a while but they don't usually see me too often.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know I want to make something a point to you, just nothin’ personal but.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I have to tell somebody cause it's bugging me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know I get a lot of medications.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I get them through the mail.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know and I've had a run in over the phone with the Pharmacy about and I tell them, how come I'm running out already?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know and they're like I'm not scheduled to get some or you must be using too many of them.  I said no I'm not.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So after that argument, which was a couple months ago, I started emptying the bottles when I get them and counting them.  They're short count.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: Now what?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: With all the patients here, sometimes it's three, sometimes it's five, that's the maximum but you know how many pills you can you know.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: How big that is, that you know prescription drugs?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean I only go by what I hear on TV but that's a big market nowadays.
DOCTOR: Okay so there's a lot of medicines that you were out of, like you said.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna renew all of them and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So 90 days supplies.
PATIENT: Oh thank you.
DOCTOR: So those are renewed.  Some of them you're on 30 days.
PATIENT: Well I hope nobody's stealing this stuff.  I mean I almost think somebody is.  Those drugs that get on the street are coming from pharmacies, no matter what kind of pharmacist.  If it's Walgreens or CVS or the hospitals you know but they're coming from pharmacies cause they're all prescription drugs.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And the worst one I heard about, I heard it today on a special on TV OxyContin.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Am I saying that right?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Oxycodone.
PATIENT: That's synthetic heroin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I didn't know that until I saw that show on TV.  They have some good shows on TV sometimes, the informative ones you know.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna renew a bunch of your meds, okay.  I'm pretty good this year.  I've been pretty good every time you called I renewed it.  Do you want to keep it that way or should I renew the ones that you're running low on right now?  How do you want to do this?  It's up to you.
PATIENT: I can still renew them.
DOCTOR: Huh?
PATIENT: I can still renew them.  I keep up with it pretty good.
DOCTOR: Are you, do you have a good supply of all your meds right now?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I don't let it get too low though.  I just.
DOCTOR: Do you call before they run out?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay good.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: So why don't we just do that.  Is there anything that you might be running of soon?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No okay, why don't we just do that.  Cause there's so many meds here.
PATIENT: Yeah I do it all.
DOCTOR: And it's just better to do it as you run out I think okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then that way I can put in the order that way.  Um otherwise looks like you're doing really well.  You're due for a repeat colonoscopy next year so I won't be putting in the order or maybe I will before I leave cause I only have another 10 months up here and you know.
PATIENT: Don't start that.
DOCTOR: I graduate in June.
PATIENT: And then what are you gonna do?
DOCTOR: Um I'm applying for Rheumatology right now so.
PATIENT: Here?
DOCTOR: All over the Midwest.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So I don't know if I'll get it here but somewhere I will.
PATIENT: Cause the doctor I had here for it she left.
DOCTOR: Yeah well we're only here for three years.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's the maximum that we can stay here for internal medicine.  Question, have you actually had a heart attack before?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You have okay.
PATIENT: Well they said two.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause that was my thought I don't know.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But they said that's the reason they wouldn't operate on my knee.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I had one during my first operation.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then when I wanted the second operation for them to reconstruct you know, take the colostomy bag out?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They said there's a possibility you'll have another heart attack, I said I don't care cause I don't want to live with this and I had another heart attack they said.  I mean I can only go with what they told me otherwise.  Cause I was already here but I don't know you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So nothing else right today?
PATIENT: Not really you know.
DOCTOR: You look good.
PATIENT: Something that concerns me every once in a while and I don't know.  In the morning when I get up I check my blood pressure and do all my stuff to know on the machine, my blood pressure's usually high in the morning.
DOCTOR: Like how high?
PATIENT: 140-150.
DOCTOR: Were you doing anything before then, were you?
PATIENT: Sleeping.
DOCTOR: Sleeping.  We could start you on something else if you'd like.
PATIENT: Then it goes down you know as the day goes on.
DOCTOR: So how high does it go?
PATIENT: It goes down to 115, 120 and stays there basically.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It never goes back up again, it's just the first.
DOCTOR: How high, what's the highest that you ever see?
PATIENT: 170.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Then you probably need to be started on medicine then.  Let's see what you're on now.
PATIENT: But when it gets high the first time I check it two more times.
DOCTOR: You are on hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and metoprolol and that's it.  Basically there’s room to go up on them.  Do you follow a cardiologist?  A heart doctor?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Hydrochlorothiazide 25, lisinopril 10, we can increase the lisinopril to 20, 20 mg.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: We can do that.
PATIENT: Once a day or twice a day?
DOCTOR: Once a day.
PATIENT: Once a day.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh I get 10 now.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So all I got to do is take two.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Until I get the new one yeah.
DOCTOR: So I'll go ahead and when the new one comes just taking two of them.  So when you go home you can take the other 10.  The metoprolol is already at 25.  Your heart rate was in the 60s so we'll keep that one also.  So yeah we'll do the lisinopril okay.
PATIENT: So I got 10 months with you huh?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Geez.
DOCTOR: So maybe just one more time.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Maybe cause I see you every six months.
PATIENT: You have to give me an autographed picture.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I've lost a lot of good doctors this way.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: It gets sad afterwards, you know you get so attached to some people and then.
DOCTOR: I know.  So but that's just the way it is.
PATIENT: You don't get attached to patients do you?
DOCTOR: No I do, I mean.
PATIENT: Do you really yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  But the thing is like we're so overworked you know and then it's just sometimes.  Like today it's really easy for me and they only put three patients in my clinic so I'm like chilling and relaxing.  Now with the 30 residents we're supposed to have seven patients, they all cancelled today for some odd reason.
PATIENT: Friday.
DOCTOR: Fridays.
PATIENT: And it's nice out.
DOCTOR: Yeah right.
PATIENT: Did you call and tell me to come early or did somebody else?
DOCTOR: I didn’t.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They told me to come an hour earlier but see when I asked.  When I have an appointment to see you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I always call back and ask do you want me to do blood work.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because I usually assume that you want that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Oh no, no, no, then the next time I call I say you sure, oh yeah we changed our mind yeah get the blood work.
DOCTOR: Actually don't call them at that time cause I usually, I see so many people that I don't order the labs until the day before until I review.
PATIENT: Oh that's what they did yeah.
DOCTOR: So call like in the evening the day before.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: And then be like hey do I need to come in for labs?  Do that from now on.
PATIENT: Cause it's not really a problem.
DOCTOR: Cause I always order like the day before Med Clinic cause I look at, cause I pre-write all my notes the day before you're coming in and then I look through the chart see what happened since the last time you've been here, do you need your labs, do you not need new labs, all of that stuff I do it the day before so otherwise I'll forget.  There are so many people I see and we get so many alerts for everybody like you need to do this and that or please do this, these are the results of this consult, it's not just one patient it's like 100 of them so.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: I try to do everything right before the appointment cause I want to know what's going on with you and I remember what to talk to you about and I know that okay this person needs labs, we need to get labs.  So call like on 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock the day before your appointment.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: At least for the next nine months, ten months.  I don't know how some of the doctors can have their own system and things are a lot.
PATIENT: Do you know who's replacing you yet?
DOCTOR: Oh no they haven't even started yet.
PATIENT: No, they haven't even picked one.
DOCTOR: Yeah cause it's the academic year, so we're still training.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So every July is when new people come in.
PATIENT: So after when you graduate you're promoted?
DOCTOR: So I could technically be a full-fledged doctor and practice out in the world, the real world.
PATIENT: The real world.
DOCTOR: But I want to go specialize.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Real world meaning no one else is supervising me.  Like right now I have to go talk to an attending be like hey this is my.
PATIENT: DOCTOR?
DOCTOR: DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: This is what I'm gonna do for this patient, do you agree with me and so if they agree or disagree.
PATIENT: Is there any particular hospital that you like?
DOCTOR: Well I don't know like I don't have any.
PATIENT: You don't have anything checked.
DOCTOR: Long term I don't plan on staying in the Chicago area.
PATIENT: Oh really.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It's not just the doctors and the traffic is [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It isn't?  Why not?
DOCTOR: You pay; you pay a lot in malpractice.
PATIENT: Oh really.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But we're so crazy, they teach us how to sue [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] no like when you spend, I don't know, [REDACTED] million dollars on medical school, your medical education and you're having the loans like, getting like a regular job isn't gonna cut it and so you're paying back loans and then you have like a certain lifestyle that you want to maintain you know it's just not gonna cut it.  Like when you have and let's say you're married to another doctor with same amount of loans that's like half a million dollars simply in loans.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that just fills up over the years you know so and then the once who do start practicing if half of that money goes to wherever and by the time you're done training you're 30 so by the time you even finish everything and pay everything off you're like what in your 50s.
PATIENT: How old are you?
DOCTOR: I'm young.  I'm younger than most people.
PATIENT: How old is young?
DOCTOR: 26.
PATIENT: Really, the same age as my granddaughter.
DOCTOR: So I'm 26 but usually people graduate medical school at 26 but I'm like, well I'll be 27 soon but I'm like two years.
PATIENT: What does your husband do?
DOCTOR: Fiancée.
PATIENT: Oh fiancée.
DOCTOR: He went here but he um he's doing a fellowship in Cardiology in Detroit.
PATIENT: Another doc.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well then you can open a clinic on your own.
DOCTOR: Maybe but he's in Detroit and I don't really want to go to Detroit.
PATIENT: Oh no me neither.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: I've been there, didn't like it.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I don't know.
PATIENT: Dirty city and dangerous city.
DOCTOR: I know.  He's right outside [REDACTED] out there.  Like even if we lived [REDACTED] side I don't care.  [REDACTED].  So let me, I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.  But you tell me to go to the 13th floor to check on that.
DOCTOR: Yeah go to the 13th floor.  Check on and see if you can reschedule the biopsy date.
PATIENT: I will.
DOCTOR: And if they say no you should see a doctor again um and I could write down the name of the doctor who saw you.
PATIENT: Yeah write on there.
DOCTOR: That way one of the clerks can look up the.
PATIENT: He's on the 13th then right?
DOCTOR: He might not be there today but the clerk will be there today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's called the GI Lab?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: GI Clinic.
DOCTOR: Wherever you want for, okay I'll see, yeah you can just go up to the GI Lab and the name of the doctor you saw DOCTOR, that's the name of the doctor.
PATIENT: Oh right.
DOCTOR: You don't have to say it just show them.
PATIENT: DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: DOCTOR, no?
DOCTOR: Give me a second (doctor makes a phone call).  Um okay.
PATIENT: Does this hot weather bother you?
DOCTOR: Uh uh.
PATIENT: Not at all.
DOCTOR: I like it.
PATIENT: I figured you did.
DOCTOR: It's cause I'm [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I know that.  You know I’m kidding.
DOCTOR: 71:40  DOCTOR IN:  77:26
DOCTOR: Alright.  So my attending wants me to renew all the meds that have a 0 or a 1 next to it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that's what I'll do so you might get a huge influx of pills in the mail.
PATIENT: No problem.  I'll use them eventually.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you will.
PATIENT: I was gonna tell you something.  Where I go to work out at.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My so-called trainer.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She's from India.  Her name is uh NAME.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I asked her how come she never used a towel or nothing, she says cause I don't sweat.  How can you not sweat?
DOCTOR: Well you know, I used to not sweat and then now every time I work out I do sweat so.
PATIENT: Right.  It's it because you're hair or what?
DOCTOR: No that's just um, that's just genetic.  I wouldn't even say it's.
PATIENT: Oh really.
DOCTOR: I think it's just some people sweat, some people.  Cause I know a lot of Indian men they sweat like.
PATIENT: Crazy right yeah.  She told me she was going to India one time, I said I ought to take a trip over there to visit you know see what it's like.
DOCTOR: Do you still take the ciprofloxacin, the antibiotic?  No, that's for the biopsy probably so.
PATIENT: Ciprofloxacin.
DOCTOR: That was for the prostate probably.
PATIENT: No, I guess I don't.  No yeah that's right yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She said I wouldn't last two days in India.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Probably not.

PATIENT: Do you have any younger kids in your family?
DOCTOR: I'm the youngest.
PATIENT: You're young, you're a baby huh.
DOCTOR: I'm the only child yes.
PATIENT: Okay.  You know one thing that tickles me.  I have a lot of Indian people who live in my building.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: More than it used to be but now more so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And with all, always the same with most of them, especially the women and the kids, they must train them when they're growing up.  The women, they just go out of their way to do stuff for me I mean my God.  I say thank you, thank you, you're really a guest, you're always [REDACTED] and they're so pleasant.  You know they even teach the kids.  The kids you know come up to me like I'm a God or something, it's serious.  You know they're so cute I feel like I got a big family you know and I got them all on my floor.  They always come out and speak to me you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah they're real nice.
DOCTOR: Well that's good.
PATIENT: They're a friendly people, really nice.  The kids are very polite.
DOCTOR: We're so friendly that we let every other country rule us historically.
PATIENT: Historically.
DOCTOR: Historically.
PATIENT: Yeah I seen all the movies about the British one day.
DOCTOR: The British.
PATIENT: They were taking all the.
DOCTOR: The [REDACTED], the Muslims.
PATIENT: There was a lot of Muslims in India still though right?
DOCTOR: I mean it's, people are pretty peaceful in India.  There's no problem within the Muslims.  I mean like I have so many Muslim friends in India that's fine, there's no [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I had a situation with a white lady.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Old grumpy one.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: We're on the elevator getting off at the same time to go check our mail.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: There's a Muslim lady.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Right and there's another Indian lady.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They got off this elevator but I was talking to them on the elevator.  She gets off, she says, what do you think about them people?  What are you talking about?  Well them two.  What about them?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Did they say something to you?  No.  Then what are you talking about?  That Muslim lady had the greatest outfit on you know it was trimmed and sewn well I was complimenting her on it at any rate.
DOCTOR: You know lots of time.
PATIENT: People are stupid.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately right now in America because of 9/11 and everything else that's going on around the world it's unfortunate cause if you think about it I mean like lots of Christians will wear necklaces with a cross on it but no one thinks anything of it you know.  So a lot of Muslim women will wear the scarf so that's just part of their cultural get up.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: So for us it's more that oh they're being oppressed but some of them would actually want to wear it you know.  I mean I wouldn't want to cause I wasn't raised that way but there's like your.
PATIENT: Who was the doctor you replaced?
DOCTOR: She was Muslim.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And she doesn't.
PATIENT: I couldn't remember her name.
DOCTOR: DOCTOR.
PATIENT: When she first came here and she was my doctor right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: She was [REDACTED].  But I was talking to her about it a couple of times, she started laughing.
DOCTOR: Well no so I think lots of times it, just one of their goals so I think they dedicate one year to wearing it, it's kind of like they're being very good.  Sort of doing this through the [REDACTED].  I mean I don't know, I'm not Muslim so I don't know any of those reasons or what was behind it but then they do it, so they'll dedicate themselves to one year basically and they'll wear it and then after that they'll carry on with a normal life without wearing it.
PATIENT: Are you a Christian?
DOCTOR: No I'm Hindu.
PATIENT: Who?
DOCTOR: Hindu, Hindu.
PATIENT: Are you?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Really.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Most Indians are Hindu.  If they're not Hindu.
PATIENT: Most?
DOCTOR: Most Indians are Hindu.
PATIENT: Cause like one lady she was trying to teach me about.
DOCTOR: If they are nurses and teachers, for some reason they tend to be Christian.
PATIENT: Yeah I noticed that yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's all the nurses here.
PATIENT: Christian.
DOCTOR: Like they are Christian and its funny cause in India most of the Christians are from this one state called Corolla and they have the highest literacy rate.  They're the most educated in terms of English that kind of thing so.  They tend to be, now it's a lot better but back in the day it had the highest literacy rate.
PATIENT: One of those ladies tried to show, she gave me a Hindu calendar.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: With some gods on it.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And I'm like where is the rest of this calendar I wanted to buy a drink.
DOCTOR: I don't understand it.  My mom doesn't understand it.  We just listen to like.
PATIENT: What's that die you do?
DOCTOR: With the henna?
PATIENT: Yeah henna that's it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I see on her eyes what is that?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Is that a tattoo?  She said no.
DOCTOR: My grandmother actually has a tattoo.  It's common back in the day for even the women to get tattoos.  It's like a symbol for God or something.  At the end of the day I think every religion is actually very similar, some people just have to learn to accept you know.  See what I don't like is somebody knocking on my door trying to convert me to something else.  That I don't appreciate.  I don't mind what religion anyone else is and I respect that religion but don't expect me to convert.
PATIENT: Okay but your Hindu but you believe in God.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: How many Gods are there, I mean really?
DOCTOR: There's a lot.
PATIENT: Huh there's a lot be we all have one God.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Basically you know.  We can call Him anything we want you know.
DOCTOR: The thing with Hinduism we've still got one supreme person.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Who has all these other little Gods.
PATIENT: Yeah.  There's some weird looking Gods.
DOCTOR: Right, yeah.  They're all serving [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh my goodness.
DOCTOR: There's a story.  It's the story behind it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You can't just literally.  It's the story behind it.  But there's a, what's it called, not a mesh but there's a morale behind each story and why the God is that way but that's the story [REDACTED].
PATIENT: One of my most favorite movies on cable about Indian people is Monsoon Wedding.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You saw that?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I loved that.  Every time it comes on I watch it again cause it really gets into that family thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know it brings it right in and they show it quite a bit too.
DOCTOR: Yeah they do.
PATIENT: That's a good movie, good movie.
DOCTOR: So yeah.
PATIENT: What I don't understand about India is how they look at slavery of the women the way they do the young ones.
DOCTOR: There's an area, an area [REDACTED] that are very progressive.  So rich in India is you will never find that kind of lifestyle anywhere in the world.  That's how unusual their lives are.  In terms of that everything is marble.  It's like the rich are very rich in India and the poor are [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Really poor yeah.
DOCTOR: Really poor and just recently the middle class has been getting large and happy.  They're actually happy about their lifestyle and everything like that.  Now everyone's getting a car.  Before no one had, my parents never grew up around cars you know.  My dad walked to school, you know that kind of thing um but yeah.  So I mean and everything is changing for the better except for the poor in India.  The only thing that, with the population that big you're gonna have poor people.  That's just I think.
PATIENT: How many allow really young girls to get husbands?  I thought about like 12, 13, 14?
DOCTOR: My grandmother was 8 when she was married.
PATIENT: Eight, you're kidding.
DOCTOR: They didn't move in with my grandfather until she was 16 though.
PATIENT: Well how she was married then?
DOCTOR: The ceremony, religiously, the ceremony.
PATIENT: Oh they were married but.
DOCTOR: They were married but she still lived at home.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Until 16 so.  At least and each state is different but in our state we had a lot of Muslim people and so I think it was custom.  I don't know back in the day in Christian societies when you are born they decided who you were gonna marry.  It's kind of like well you two are gonna get married together.
PATIENT: They still do that.
DOCTOR: They still do that.
PATIENT: Yeah I know they do cause that's this girl I know.  That's how she got and met her husband.
DOCTOR: Yeah so that's how they do it but in Indian they actually go ahead and do the ceremony all together and lots of time with the Muslim people they respected married women or girls but they didn't respect unmarried ones so then things that shouldn't happen happened so in our area there were a lot of strikes, back in the day, between Muslims and Hindus and all the other stuff.  But because they respected Hindu women and their sacredness, they left those girls alone.
PATIENT: Did they.  Why when women get in a car with like a man's going and some of them are going why do the women sit in the back seat?
DOCTOR: Um you mean if there's a taxi driver?
PATIENT: No I'm not talking about a taxi I'm talking about a residential car.  The man gets in the front and drives and the women sit in the back like if there's two women they sit in the back.
DOCTOR: I don't know.
PATIENT: In my building they do a lot.  I see it a lot.
DOCTOR: My building doesn't do that at all.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Uh uh, so I don't know.  In India if there's a driver, if you have a driver.
PATIENT: Probably different.
DOCTOR: If you have a driver that's hired that's when you only sit in the back.  You never sit in the front.
PATIENT: Yeah well that makes more sense.
DOCTOR: And if you're in the front it's the man that's in the front.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Cause you don't want the taxi driver getting into your whatever it is.  But it's just custom.  Cause they're a different class, you would sit in the back, it's a different class so.  Working class versus not working class basically so.
PATIENT: Is it true that Indian people don't bury their dead?
DOCTOR: Yeah we cremate.
PATIENT: They cremate right?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If we had to bury a billion people there would be no place for them.
PATIENT: There was no place to bury them right?
DOCTOR: Yeah so.
PATIENT: That's what I heard.
DOCTOR: So it's better that way.
PATIENT: I seen it in a movie.  They don't bring that up too much.  You don't hear too much about that.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's cause other cultures cremate too.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Some Christians cremate.
PATIENT: That's what I've got decided for me, cremation.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I says yeah sure.  What do I care about the funeral?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know cremate me and get it over with, it doesn't make any difference.  Throw me somewhere, I don't know.  Spread my ashes over Lake Michigan or something whatever you want to do.  Yeah.  I love to study other cultures but you know.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, it’s really cool.
PATIENT: India is a very interesting place you know.  I seen old movies from the.
DOCTOR: Well the thing is in India there's so many different, it's very tribal and each state.
PATIENT: Yeah I know.
DOCTOR: Also has its own religion so it's almost like separate countries and each type of Indian follows one God and it's very confusing.
PATIENT: Yeah oh I got a case for you.  In my building I met this, this family.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: This lady and her husband and her son right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And all of a sudden she had, she had to go back to India.  Her husband died, that's what it was.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Her husband died and her and her son had to go back to India.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I said why, cause they were never married.  He was an American citizen but she never married him so she got nothing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So she got deported basically.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That was kind of a bummer.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know the kid too.  He was crying cause he didn't want to go back.  He seen it and didn't like it.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's unfortunate.  Like now, there's a lot of medical couples that [REDACTED] actually study in Nassau.  Like half of them are in America, the other half is in India.  I know a couple of my cousins who are my age they came to America.  Because in America you have to work.  If you work you'll get the benefits in most cases right.  In India if you already have money you don't have to work.  You can live a long amazing life without working if your family has money and my cousin's family they have money so they didn't want to work here.  Especially the girl she could be a nice housewife and like her husband's rich, like he owns like a construction company which is huge now because it's like a booming economy there.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So she's just gonna go ahead and primarily do the whole housewife thing you know and the thing is in India you have servants for everything.  You have a cook.  Every middle class family has a servant.  In America we're cleaning our own bathrooms and we're doing everything even though we're doctors and lawyers or whatever you make.  We're still getting down on all fours and scrubbing our floors.  You know unless you hire somebody but even then it's more expensive here and there it's dirt cheap.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know so I mean for those reasons a couple of my cousins went back because I don't want to do this.  I had a much better life in India you know so.
PATIENT: But that's what they do, they come and you know get married, you gotta go back.  Like the woman when her husband died.  She's not an American citizen.
DOCTOR: Well it depends on the visa that she came on.
PATIENT: Yeah I know.
DOCTOR: If she's on a school visa then once she finishes school then that's it she has to go back you know.  But her kid if the kid was born in America they can technically stay but obviously he could go with his mom so.  So that's that.  There's lot of stories like that so.
PATIENT: Yeah I remember the old movies with what was it Darren Grant the Bengal dancers.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Who were those guys that did the studies, they called them they wear white things on their head and they was really dark?  Indian doctors and they really weren't.
DOCTOR: I don't think they're Indian but you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well what are they Mongols right now?
DOCTOR: Probably but like the thing is my grandfather would [REDACTED] even though he's not Sikh.  Sikh people were [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Sikh yeah I know that.
DOCTOR: My grandfather was a village [REDACTED].  So [REDACTED] now in today's world you're [REDACTED] Sikh but back in the day it was the firstborn son or the village had [REDACTED] then it's over generations it's changed.
PATIENT: You ever go up to Divan?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No I don't like the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I seen some guys with the light blue turbans.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they have like a robe that they wear.  You know they'll all have the grey beards.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know they're all related but I know they're always just some kind of religious thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's the Sikh religion.
PATIENT: Yeah they were cool.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: How is it determined with the women where they get the thing here, what does that mean?
DOCTOR: It's actually if you go back with the story, that's the evil eye.  It was the way.  Technically it's the third eye and now it's become one of the beautiful, like a sign of beauty.
PATIENT: But that doesn't have nothing to do with being married or not married?
DOCTOR: No.  If it's up here, if there's like red powder up here that means they're married cause DOCTOR will every now and then, every now and then she'll wear it yeah.
PATIENT: Really?
DOCTOR: In the crease in the part of the hair she'll wear it [REDACTED].  But usually they don't do it in the workplace usually.  It's usually like [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Why would they do it to a little baby?  No the woman would do it to her little baby.
DOCTOR: If it's here, if it's right here, it's just offering blessings and.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Really not the evil eye.  If it's in the hairline then that means they're married.
PATIENT: Yeah, but she was married but I don't know.
DOCTOR: If it's in the hairline that means they're married.
PATIENT: When I looked at the little baby I thought.
DOCTOR: Oh no that's we everyone wears it in India and now it's just like everyone wears it so.  I don't even the know the reasons we have the traditions.  [REDACTED] so.
PATIENT: Have a good day, another day.
DOCTOR: Yeah take care.
PATIENT: You too.
DOCTOR: Six months okay.
PATIENT: Okay doc, you got it.
DOCTOR: So have that thing.
PATIENT: 100:40.
Time is 11:58.
