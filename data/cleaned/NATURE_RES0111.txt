DOCTOR: OK, well we recommend that you you get your vaccines and um also the uh HPV vaccine. Um it's it's best to get the HPV vaccine earlier on. It's a little bit less effective as you um go past a certain age, you are still obviously nowhere close to that, but it's,  I I don't believe it's covered after the age of 26 either, so it's best if you get it done earlier.

PATIENT: Uh I don't think so.
DOCTOR: No, OK alright. And have you looked at your throat? Does it look swollen or red?
PATIENT: Yeah, it looks pretty swollen and red.
DOCTOR: Well, that's all the questions, oh one more question actually. Do you have um any medical conditions that run in the family?
PATIENT: Um no, I don't think so. Maybe like high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Uh all right, well um that's all the questions I had. We'll do a physical exam, have a look inside your throat. Um given uh the symptoms that you have, it sounds like you have um an an inflammation or swelling of your throat which could be caused by bacteria or viruses. It could be something like um mono, or it could be um strep throat. Um it could be other things as well. Um seeing that your symptoms are somewhat overlapping with the symptoms for covid, we would also like to do a Covid test. Um we'll do a rapid strep test here as well um just to rule it out and then uh we'll uh ask you to quarantine for the next 14 days um until or at least until your covid swabs are back or your symptoms improve um and we'll let you know about um the management based on the strep test result. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Um no, that sounds great, thank you.
DOCTOR: OK sounds good.
