SECOND PERSON F276
What were the blood tests?
DOCTOR: So we had, right we did a liver test, the cholesterol which looks like it's controlled.  We did the blood count for like the hemoglobin and anemia which we took a look at and then we checked his kidney function which was okay.
SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then we checked the TSH which is thyroid and the B12 um which can sometimes be abnormal and can affect people on memory loss, that is still pending.  Uh the TSH was normal though.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.
DOCTOR: That's another thing that can affect memory, too.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so um so we will have, um what we talked about is having you go to the PAC.
SECOND PERSON F276
Right.
DOCTOR: And um it's near the Emergency Room.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.
DOCTOR: And there's a physician there that you can talk to, it's a walk-in clinic.
SECOND PERSON F276
Oh.
DOCTOR: So um we can call there before you go or something but um.
SECOND PERSON F276
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: We'll get.
SECOND PERSON F276
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  I will be right back.
SECOND PERSON F276
Is the iron low?  Cause he is on iron but its.
DOCTOR: Um his hemoglobin's okay.  We didn't check the iron.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay that's fine yeah.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back.
SECOND PERSON F276
Oh okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  85:50  DOCTOR IN:  98:40)
DOCTOR: Alright PATIENT how are you?
PATIENT: I'm doing good, how about you?
DOCTOR: Alright um so, you don’t think you’re sleeping good?  Your sleep is good.  Do you sleep good?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] some days are good and others are not?
PATIENT: Yeah like a baby.
DOCTOR: Not all day though?  Not all day, you don't sleep like a baby.
PATIENT: No, no, no.  [REDACTED].
Doctors speak with one another about treatment.
DOCTOR: His blood pressure is a little bit on the low side but does it run low at home?
SECOND PERSON F276
Yeah and he doesn't drink enough water and I just wanted to make sure.  Is he on any medicines, his blood pressure? No, right?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah he's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay so here is the plan.  So we'll get some potassium since the level is just a little bit [REDACTED] okay.  Oh and then go to the PAC Clinic, DOCTOR already know about him um so I want him to be evaluated to see if any medications would help him you know getting this.  I think [REDACTED] we need to prevent not able to sleep at night.
SECOND PERSON F276
Right.
DOCTOR: So I think that's kind of sedating the next day so when he doesn't rest then obviously he's a lot more confused, a lot more paranoid and that makes things worse.
SECOND PERSON F276
Right.
DOCTOR: So we'll see what they will send us.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Cause it's still psychiatry's stuff so.  And then as far as home-based health care aid, they will contact you.  I gave your number to her.
SECOND PERSON F276
No you didn't give me a number.
DOCTOR: No I gave your number to her and they will contact you.
SECOND PERSON F276
Oh.
DOCTOR: Because they need the family member's approval.  So he gets the visiting nurse but the visiting nurse has to stop and let these people take over because the nurse also comes from the VA.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay, so what do you think about the Home Health Care?
DOCTOR: I think it is, because he can't come to so many appointments and his situation may need more of home therapy based rather than consult based.
SECOND PERSON F276
Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I think that is uh, that is a good thing.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.
DOCTOR: In fact I would um, I would recommend that.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um not that I don't like PATIENT because it's that a lot more easier.
SECOND PERSON F276
Yeah.
DOCTOR: For him to get more care.  Especially the physical therapy and other things also.
SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright and then um let us see, they may have, sometimes they don't have opening available in that area so we don't even know anymore ourselves but at least give it a try.
SECOND PERSON F276
Right.
DOCTOR: Um and then the, you have a homemaker?
SECOND PERSON F276
Um.
DOCTOR: Actually, do you want a homemaker?
SECOND PERSON F276
What do they do, cleaning?
PATIENT: No, no, no, no, no.
SECOND PERSON F276
Dad.
PATIENT: No issue with my house.
DOCTOR: So that is the only other help that [REDACTED] that's helping him.
SECOND PERSON F276
The um, cause NAME has someone come in.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
SECOND PERSON F276
To do the like a little bit of cleaning.  No cooking though.
DOCTOR: No they don't cook, it's just cleaning.
SECOND PERSON F276
Do they clean?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON F276
Then right now no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  So we'll just wait for the [REDACTED] to do that.
SECOND PERSON F276
And then if we change our mind we could, cause we won't be seeing you then.
DOCTOR: Um they say [REDACTED] will be the primary physician.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um the, so but uh I think given the whole benefit of the program.
SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That may be good for him though.
SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So because.
SECOND PERSON F276
DOCTOR. You like the program?
DOCTOR: Yeah they are usually pretty good.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.
DOCTOR: They talk with physical therapy, the nurses are called I mean you have a lot more access to the nurses if they did, if he gets sick they are more [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON F276
So [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah that's what I’m saying, if he gets sick the nurse will rush right [REDACTED].  That's part of the same as what I would do but on the other hand getting like him not coming for more appointments and especially with physical therapy and stuff like that uh that would be more convenient at home.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay and you would initiate that and they'll [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I already did.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.
DOCTOR: They will find out whether or not there are any available in your area.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.  Thank you doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So before you go home.
SECOND PERSON F276

DOCTOR: Um HP, HP, HBPC, Home-Based Primary Care that's what she's saying so [REDACTED].  It could either be a doctor or a physical therapy that will take over.
SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.
DOCTOR: And they would keep watch over [REDACTED] instead of the hospital, I mean clinic.  Okay, let me put in the consult, so this is where you go in, once I put this order in.
