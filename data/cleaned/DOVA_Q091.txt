DOCTOR: PATIENT?  You're here.
PATIENT: Here.
DOCTOR: Oh, there you are, sorry about that.  I wasn't looking at this chair.  How you guys doing?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Come on back.  Come on in, alright.  Good to see you again.  It's been a few months.
PATIENT: Yes it has.  I don't like this system.  I used to make appointments, now they you get on at six months.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: Anyway, I was just looking this list over.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And this one is missing, the vitamin D.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I'm out of them.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Oh.
PATIENT: I have the one I take for the 15th but that emptied it and I called them in and they tell me they're gonna get to you and get permission and call them back in a week but.
DOCTOR: Well you know why because we only do that high dose monthly vitamin D for three months but then it's supposed to go to weekly.  Let me just see what we need.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Really.
DOCTOR: Yeah, if somebody is very deficient in vitamin D, we put them on a high dose pill once a month for a few months, no you know what we do, we do it once a week for a few weeks and then we'll go to once a month.
PATIENT: I was once a month always.
DOCTOR: You never were on once a week.
SECOND PERSON Q091
No.
DOCTOR: Oh, let's just see what we had.  Did I prescribe this for you or did you get it from one of the other doctors, do you remember?
SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh I wonder if DOCTOR.
PATIENT: No uh uh, it was a doctor here.  I don't know.
DOCTOR: Not the kidney?
PATIENT: I've had so many.
DOCTOR: Kidney folks?
PATIENT: Could have been DOCTOR.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh yeah could have been DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Probably DOCTOR.
SECOND PERSON Q091
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Or what's that gal's name that was the pharmacist?
SECOND PERSON Q091
I don't know.
DOCTOR: You know it looks like your levels are actually and you just had them done and they look normal.  Let me just.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh good.
DOCTOR: It looks like they've come back up.  So we may be able to put you on a lower daily dose rather than worry about this high dose stuff.  Let me see here.  Yeah I think we could probably move to a daily.  How long have you been taking that monthly vitamin D?  Has it been a long time?
PATIENT: Oh I would say at least a year.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Just that one tablet a month?
PATIENT: Yes.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Yes.
DOCTOR: Well I mean if it's working.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Alright, okay.  It was added uh in December of 2010 and it was DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Oh so it was uh, okay so we'll just keep going with it then.  I don't want to change the uh you know.  You want to just here; do you want it in the mail?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I still, I just took the one, the 15th I took one and so I got a month to get it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Q091
There's no overdose problems?
DOCTOR: No it's rare to overdose on vitamin D yeah um okay, so that's in, okay.
PATIENT: And there's a lot of these that you better check cause they're down to one refill.
DOCTOR: Yep we'll go through all of them.
PATIENT: I really have fun trying to get them when they run out.
DOCTOR: Let's go through all those.
PATIENT: That pharmacy joke.
DOCTOR: But first just to check in are you still taking your blood pressures at home?
PATIENT: Yeah I got a new blood pressure machine here because I think and it starts here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And goes on the back page because the other one was way off.
DOCTOR: So this was your new one you just got like a week ago or so.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I'm running at 130 you're talking about.
DOCTOR: You're a little high.
PATIENT: Every once in a while I'll get down but uh.
DOCTOR: Overall a little high.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Now I was just looking at the last time you saw DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And DOCTOR you see him too it looks like.
PATIENT: That was just Friday.
DOCTOR: Yeah and they had suggested that you, so you're taking the Valsartan 160 mg in the morning and then.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: What are you taking for Valsartan?
PATIENT: I take Valsartan 160 after dinner.  I take 160, two of the pills.  Then at bedtime I take either one or two, depending on what the blood pressure is at that time.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you take two in the morning?
PATIENT: I don't take them in the morning.
DOCTOR: How come you're not taking them in the morning?
PATIENT: Cause I'm taking them when they told me to, for years.
DOCTOR: They told you to take those at night?  We have written in the note that it's in the morning, that's the only reason I asked.
PATIENT: Well I think that'd be a lot smarter because it doesn't work very fast.  For instance.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: If I take it at dinnertime, the blood pressure, you'll notice on there the blood pressure goes up at night.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Every night and after I've taken two of these, so they must be very slow acting.
DOCTOR: That's, so that's the reason I asked because what they suggested was that instead of taking that extra Valsartan if it's high you change it and make it a different medication that's faster acting that you can take if you have a high reading, called hydralazine.  It's another blood pressure pill.  It works very quickly so it'll bring you down faster.  Like you said the Valsartan doesn't work quickly.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I think what we should do.
PATIENT: Why don't they put on the bottle when to take it?
DOCTOR: I don't know and it should be.
PATIENT: None of them do.
DOCTOR: Oh they don't put that on them?
PATIENT: Not a single bottle tells us when to take them.
DOCTOR: Well I can [REDACTED].
PATIENT: This is what I take when.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So after breakfast, okay let me check it with my list here.  Alright so amlodipine you're taking the one in the morning and then your furosemide you take in the morning, metoprolol you take a half twice a day good.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: And then allopurinol you're only taking every other day?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: I don't even have that on here, oh yes I do.  Do you get that from us?
PATIENT: Yes.  Oh wait a minute, maybe I.
DOCTOR: No maybe you get that one.
PATIENT: Maybe that's the one I get at Target cause it's four dollars.
DOCTOR: Yes that's probably what it is and then after lunch you have a gabapentin okay and then another one in the evening okay.  Then you have the Valsartan at okay and your aspirin and then another Valsartan.  And you have the simvastatin at night.
PATIENT: And then that one, on the other side it's the, that was the vitamin we were just talking about.
DOCTOR: Oh the vitamin D and then you have you're um your pain pills, the Vicodin as needed okay.
PATIENT: Okay now what I have, I have a three year old bottle of, I wrote it down, I'm having runny nose and itchy eyes, you know spring has come early.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Sure has.
PATIENT: And this is what I used to have.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh and also on the bottle I've gotten written for itch.  I haven't seen it, is that for, is this another one?
DOCTOR: Yeah that's you know for allergies.
PATIENT: My kids have cats so I really have a problem so what I need and they're three years old so I was afraid to take them.
DOCTOR: We can get you some new ones, not a problem.
PATIENT: But I'm wondering if that's what I should be taking now.
DOCTOR: Yeah that should be fine and then you can get this stuff over-the-counter but if it's easier we can get it for you. It's called, you'll see it over-the-counter as Zyrtec um and it's for itchy eyes, runny nose, these types of things um.
PATIENT: Well put.
DOCTOR: You could take one a day which is probably what you were taking previously.  Do you want a prescription for this?
PATIENT: Yes please.
DOCTOR: Okay let's put that in then.  Let me get that sorted out.  Do you want to pick it up today or do you want it sent out?
PATIENT: No that's why I'm all dressed up; I'm going down to the big city for symphony for my birthday.
DOCTOR: Oh my goodness.  Oh wonderful.  Oh yeah, so it was just your birthday a couple days ago huh.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Yes it was.
PATIENT: Like yesterday.
DOCTOR: How exciting.
PATIENT: But I've had three of them so I.
DOCTOR: So you're going to the Chicago Symphony is that the?
SECOND PERSON Q091
Yeah, three nights of it.
DOCTOR: Oh how fun.
SECOND PERSON Q091
For a celebration.
DOCTOR: My parents used to have season tickets and they were in the um seats that are like around the back of the orchestra so you're looking down.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh I wanted that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Q091
We've never sat there.
DOCTOR: Oh it was fun.
SECOND PERSON Q091
We'll have to do that sometime.
DOCTOR: Sometime you guys should try the tickets there cause it's really interesting to be right in front of the conductor and you get to look down on the percussionists and it's a completely different view and the sound is, in that place is great everywhere.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Yeah.  We sat on the last row in the gallery.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
SECOND PERSON Q091
It's wonderful.
DOCTOR: Its awe, I mean it's such an amazing place.
SECOND PERSON Q091
It is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so that one's in and then I have on here that you have an albuterol inhaler.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you still have that one?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Do you take it as needed?
PATIENT: Yes and I only seem to get wheezy at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Usually every night I'll have to take a couple of puffs of that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I think what we'll.
PATIENT: Is that not on there?
DOCTOR: Uh it's not on; it's not on your list.
PATIENT: No well I don't show it there.
DOCTOR: It's on mine though and you still have it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I think what we should do is have you take the valsartan um 160 mg in the morning, that after dinner dose, I think you should move it to your after breakfast dose.  Are you okay with doing that?  Because that's what they have written in your kidney doctor notes that you're taking it in the morning and I don't know why that got confused um but usually it's better to spread out those doses so that it will work for you.
PATIENT: You say take two, cause I get 80 mg.
DOCTOR: So take the two of them after breakfast.
PATIENT: Okay and then when do I take the next one or two?
DOCTOR: You know what I think probably what we should do is maybe bump you up to having you just take two in the evening.
PATIENT: So two in the morning and two in the evening?
DOCTOR: Yeah that's kind of.
PATIENT: When you say evening are you talking bedtime or you're talking dinnertime?
DOCTOR: You know what, it doesn't really matter that much um.
PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: You know usually with a medicine like this that you take twice a day, we space them about 12 hours apart because that's the amount of time they usually work so if you get up and you eat breakfast at 8 o'clock and you take your medicines at 9, then take it probably before bed at 9, but if you're a real early riser and you're taking them at about 6.
SECOND PERSON Q091
He's not an early riser any more.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  So take them after breakfast and then maybe before bed.
PATIENT: Would you write that down please?
SECOND PERSON Q091
I am.
PATIENT: Is there any way they can put that on the tab?
DOCTOR: I'm gonna change it so that you do.
PATIENT: Because not a single medicine there.
DOCTOR: Yeah I.
PATIENT: And uh.
DOCTOR: And I know, they'll probably.  I'm trying to think, you're running a little bit high um.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm running.
DOCTOR: But we don't want you to be too low either.  DOCTOR wrote in her note that um they want you to be more a goal of the 140/90s for you because we don't want you to drop too low.
PATIENT: I never get 90 the second one.
DOCTOR: Well under, under 140/90.  But your top number's usually higher than 140.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: 140.
DOCTOR: You do have a couple in the 100, 110 reading.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] well I even got a 103 here.  103, 46.
DOCTOR: We don't want you know, those low ones to go any lower.
PATIENT: 142 but then it's 122, 19, 10, then 160, 146, 165, 150.
DOCTOR: So you're not, you're not really far off goal.  You're not so high that I want to make a lot of changes so maybe instead what.
PATIENT: Maybe it won't be high if I take them at the right time.
DOCTOR: Well that's what I'm thinking.  You might be under better control if you're going to take your valsartan in the morning now and you're seeing DOCTOR again next month.
PATIENT: Yeah because the creatinine got high.
DOCTOR: Creatinine went up a little bit.
PATIENT: She wants another blood test in six weeks.
DOCTOR: So yeah okay.  So maybe that's the only change I want to make today is to really change the time.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Of that dose and see if that helps um, cause I'd hate to add another medication and have you go any lower.  We don't want to see you get too low because then you can start seeing things like dizziness or.
SECOND PERSON Q091
He went through a period of that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Now if he takes two pills it’s been so erratic [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Q091
It's hard to change.
DOCTOR: Right.
SECOND PERSON Q091
The medications.
DOCTOR: I'd almost rather you be just a little above goal then to worry about falling.
SECOND PERSON Q091
He really feels lousy when it's low.
DOCTOR: Oh I'm, it's a terrible feeling I mean, so 150s-160s but with some lower values in the 100s-120s.  We'll give you valsartan after dinner 160 mg and also before bed either 80 or 160 mg okay.  How are you feeling overall?  Are you feeling okay?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you're not having low blood pressure where you're actually getting real dizzy or lightheaded?
PATIENT: No I haven't had that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I haven't had any swelling either.
DOCTOR: That's great.  That's good.  And then the Vicodin is controlling the pain okay?  You have the arthritis pain is that right?
PATIENT: Well it's funny how that, it does the back and hips really good.  I mean plus the fact that my family doctor I see every six months.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Gave me some exercises in the morning.
DOCTOR: Oh that's good.
PATIENT: Back exercises.  And that, so I really, I was always taking six Vicodin and most of the time now I take four.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But if I can't sleep because I'm in so much pain but the Vicodin doesn't work for the shoulders.  It seems to work from here down.
DOCTOR: That's a little strange.
PATIENT: And that's strange isn't it.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Have you tried ever anything else?  I mean that's a pretty good pain medicine but.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Maybe the shoulder, we're seeing a little more inflammation.
PATIENT: Well I just.
DOCTOR: I don't want you to take any.
PATIENT: When I had my six month with the family doctor.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And he gave me a cortisone shot.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: He wouldn't do the other one because he wants to see if it works and it worked.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: So I may go back and have another one, but I had the right shoulder replaced.
DOCTOR: Oh you did okay.
PATIENT: That was eight years ago and it's the worst but and I was trying to get an appointment with that guy and I don't know, they don't answer their phones.
DOCTOR: You saw an orthopedic doctor?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, the one that.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Was it here?
PATIENT: The one that, no it was at the Hinsdale Hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Hinsdale Orthopedics, for both my back and both knees have been replaced too.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you doing okay with the orthopedic doctors there or did you want to see someone here?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: I got enough doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright so we did the medicines um and then you have your allopurinol you get at Target.  The aspirin, baby aspirin you take, we looked at that one and then your eye drops, it looks like and you get that from someone else.
PATIENT: Yeah after this doctor here I wouldn't take them.
DOCTOR: Oh really.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Which made my eye doctor mad cause he was involved somehow with the hospital here and so I went to her and she said you got to quit him and bring all your files to me.  It was a woman downstairs here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I said all I wanted to do was get the medication and she said nope won't do it.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Eye drops so I was paying, well I just went generic it went from $97 a month to 12 or something.
DOCTOR: Oh well that's good.
PATIENT: Crazy.
DOCTOR: That's a lot better isn't it?
SECOND PERSON Q091
Wow.
PATIENT: So it's uh and one of them is about $40 and one of them is $20.  I went to Canada to get one of them.
DOCTOR: Hmm and they tried to get them and they wouldn't give them to you here?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Now any other time, like my heart doctor's recommendation.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: And he would fax it here and they would you know whoever would, I've had five of you.
DOCTOR: Right I know.
PATIENT: But they automatically would put it in.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: The heart doctor did that and I don't know that my family doctor.
DOCTOR: Well if you fax me a prescription from your eye doctor I can try to get them here.  If I have prescription I can try to put it in.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well it's down to you know $12.
DOCTOR: Well that's a lot better yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah it's not worth doing now I don't think but uh.
DOCTOR: Maybe we can have.
PATIENT: Well you give me three capsules of course I don't know what that would cost outside.  So many of that stuff is in the $4 list now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: At the drug store.
DOCTOR: It makes it much easier.
PATIENT: But I don't know and you.
DOCTOR: I think ours are 8.
PATIENT: Uh I think they're 9 now, they were $8 now they're 9.
DOCTOR: Oh they're 9, they all went up.
PATIENT: Which is alright but when you're only getting three pills I don't know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well we'll go through your lab tests real quick.  Your vitamin D, as I said, it looks okay.  A little low still so we'll keep you on the same thing that the kidney doctor wanted.  Um I'm sure they talked to you a little bit, your creatinine is elevated as you know.
PATIENT: Yeah but I didn't get the point there was anything I could do about it.
DOCTOR: No I think they're just observing like keeping away from any medications that could make it worse and I think controlling the blood pressure as well.
PATIENT: That's what.
DOCTOR: As you can is the best thing.  Blood counts look fine, no problems there.  No anemia anything like that.  Um urine looks good.  Electrolytes all look fine.  We talked about the creatinine.  Cholesterol looks good, no problems with that and the liver.
PATIENT: I'm surprised that's as good cause they cut that down, I'm cutting out the pill I have in quarters.
DOCTOR: Oh really?
PATIENT: Yeah what does it show here?
DOCTOR: Simvastatin.
PATIENT: Yeah well I probably have 80 originally.
DOCTOR: Oh and now they're.
PATIENT: I was taking a half of that.
DOCTOR: You're at 20.  Are you getting your 40 mg pills now?  You are supposed to be getting 40.
PATIENT: I haven't gotten any yet because I got them once but I had so many left over that I'm cutting up.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And I've been taking those.
DOCTOR: Well that's, that's annoying but it's fine if you want to use those up.  I know it's annoying to cut them in fourths.  The next one you get should be a 40 mg pill so you'll only have to cut that one in half.
PATIENT: And you cut that in half.
DOCTOR: Right but the cholesterol levels look really good.  Your liver function looks completely normal and your iron is normal too.  Your iron level, so everything looks actually really pretty good.  Um except for the kidney function and we talked about that already.  So keep going on that and then make sure you have a refill.  Gabapentin you're taking basically two capsules a day.  Is it easier for you to get 90 day supplies of things?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Let's change that then.  Some of these are at 30 or 60; I don't know why they do that.
PATIENT: I don't know either.
DOCTOR: So the next time you should get 90 day supply, we'll give you three refills so you don't have to keep calling.  Metoprolol oh that one's a 30 day supply, see I don't know why they have it.  Let's give you a 90 day supply of that one too.  And then hopefully it'll last you a little longer.  It looks like pantoprazole has been renewed.  That's the one you take for the acid reflux.
PATIENT: Has it been renewed?
DOCTOR: It's been renewed.
PATIENT: Because that's the one that ran out.
DOCTOR: Simvastatin.
PATIENT: And how many?
DOCTOR: That's a 90 day.
PATIENT: But you're putting that in for.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Some more refills, because we figure what you're six months.
DOCTOR: Yep.  Yep so you should have at least you know.
PATIENT: Now the one you can't do for six months is the Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Right I can only do a 30 day supply.  Amlodipine, let's give you a 90 day supply of that one cause you're on a 30 day supply okay.
PATIENT: How many refills can you give me on Vicodin?
DOCTOR: Um I don't think, I don't know that there's a limit.  I can give you as many refills as you want.
PATIENT: Well somebody said they could only go for four refills or something.
DOCTOR: You have two right now.
PATIENT: That changes and I don't think it's a good as it used to be.  I don't know what they did to it.
DOCTOR: They took a little bit of the Tylenol out of it is what they did.
PATIENT: Did that affect it?
DOCTOR: Well you know, the stronger drug in the medication, the hydrocodone was not changed and they decreased the Tylenol because they're finding that higher doses of Tylenol can cause liver problems along down the road so having less Tylenol in there is less harmful to your liver but it may have taken away some of the pain.
PATIENT: Yeah it doesn't work as good.
DOCTOR: Okay I've given you a bunch of refills of that one so you'll have enough.  Albuterol you have plenty of refills on your inhaler.
PATIENT: Yeah I don't use that as often.
DOCTOR: Pantoprazole was already done.  Lasix, the furosemide you have a lot of refills but it's only a 30 day supply so let me make it a 90 day supply and we’ll havet everything to be 90 okay and valsartan you only have a 30 day supply so let me can change that one.  So this will basically just mean that the next time you order it, it should be 90 days worth, which will make things easier, you don't have to call as often and then the calcitriol.
PATIENT: It makes it easier until you change the medicine and then I've got 90 days of it.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.  Well that's true.  Hopefully we won't be making too many changes and then the calcitriol, wait were you still taking that one?
PATIENT: What one?
DOCTOR: The calcitriol?
SECOND PERSON Q091
Calcitriol?
DOCTOR: I don't think.
PATIENT: What is that?
DOCTOR: It's another type of vitamin D actually.  You had two times weekly is what I have on here.
SECOND PERSON Q091
He might take that I don't know.
PATIENT: Look on our list.
DOCTOR: And then the big vitamin D we already and your metoprolol it's showing me has expired.
SECOND PERSON Q091
What's that?
PATIENT: What did you call it?
DOCTOR: Calcitriol, this guy.
PATIENT: Well I'm taking it.
DOCTOR: Twice a week you're on that one?
PATIENT: Yep.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh my gosh and you're taking the once a month as well?
DOCTOR: It's yeah.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Gee, that's a lot of vitamin D.
DOCTOR: Sometimes when people are low, so I mean I don't think I was the one who prescribed that for you.  Oh.
PATIENT: That's what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: So was this, this is from your primary doctor okay.
PATIENT: No he is my primary doctor.
DOCTOR: Oh but you made this?
PATIENT: I made this also because everybody asks me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: These are all the operations and.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, this is good, okay.
PATIENT: Do you want a copy of it?
DOCTOR: No that's okay cause we have most of this information in here but it's good to have that with you.
PATIENT: But does that clarify this?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I take, what's there I take.
DOCTOR: So let's get you some refills then if it's, you know it seems to be working.  And the metoprolol we've got, oh wait that one twice.
SECOND PERSON Q091
How many milligrams is that vitamin D?
DOCTOR: 0.25 micrograms.  It's a different kind of vitamin D.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh is it?  Okay.
DOCTOR: Um it works differently.  I can't tell you all the mechanisms but, make sure I am telling you the right thing.  You know I think it's because of the kidney disease, if I'm not mistaken.  I did that one twice.  So let's sign all those and these should be all refilled now.  It's telling me, why are you beeping at me.  It's telling me you had side effects to furosemide before, is that true?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You’ve been taking it for awhile.
PATIENT: No, no I haven't had any side effects from furosemide.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: There was another one that I did have side effects with.  I forget what it was.  I think that it was one that I was taking when I was, before I had that tumor removed, what's that kidney, I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright so I have that all straightened out.  Let's do an exam and make sure everything looks okay.  Have a seat up here.  What time is your concert today?
SECOND PERSON Q091
1:30.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: When is it?
SECOND PERSON Q091
1:30.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna retake your blood pressure just to see if it's gone down.
PATIENT: I think it's gone down since I walked a half a mile.  You know since they changed the parking.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know.
PATIENT: It's really a hike.
DOCTOR: And you took all your blood pressure pills this morning?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Good.  About 152/72.
PATIENT: Yeah see that's unusual too cause usually when I take those pills I go over to the Health Club and I ride the bike for a half an hour.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I walk the treadmill for ten minutes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And when I get home, I take it, you know I walk in the pool sometimes and uh when I get home it'll be in the 120s.
DOCTOR: Oh well that's terrific.  I'm just going to peek in your ear.
PATIENT: So the exercise must be.
DOCTOR: Oh that's helping a lot yeah that's great.
PATIENT: Helping.
DOCTOR: You've got some wax in there.
PATIENT: But I notice uh.
DOCTOR: I'm going to look for you can put them back in.
PATIENT: Yeah put you back on the air.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's why I don't really want to give you more blood pressure medicine because you have periods of time where you're normal, 120.  We don't want you to be a lot lower than that I mean then we'll start seeing some dizziness.  Open wide for me, say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Good, and lift the end of your tongue, good.  Take your glasses off just for sec I want to take a peek at your pupils here.  Okay, you can put them back on.  Let me take a quick feel of the neck here.  Oh maybe a little bit of a lymph node on this side.  So do you have a little bit of?
PATIENT: One of them was removed.
DOCTOR: This side maybe.  Maybe that's why it's a little different.  Do you have a removal on that side?
PATIENT: I don't remember which side cause I was about 30 years old.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I'm now 87 so that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Long time ago.  A couple deep breaths here.  Good.  Alright go ahead and lay back for me, look at the belly.  I'm going to untuck you for a second here.  Have your bowel movements been normal?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: No blood or tarry stools, black stools?
PATIENT: Nope.  A stomach ache every once in a while that nobody can figure out.
DOCTOR: Yeah I think we talked about that last time you were here.
PATIENT: Yeah.  My family doctor said I should have a test at the hospital but.
DOCTOR: How often are you getting it now?
PATIENT: Well I think, about two or three weeks apart.
DOCTOR: And it's still sort of late in the day?
PATIENT: But it wasn't as severe last time.
DOCTOR: Sit up for me.
PATIENT: Only lasted four hours instead of 12.  I've had them last from after breakfast I would get it on Sunday so I didn't have to go to church and it would last until 11 o'clock at night.
DOCTOR: Wait one more test for you.  Lets check your strength here.  Toes up in the air, you've been getting them less frequently, push down and kick up.
PATIENT: I don't know if they're less frequent.
DOCTOR: Push back.
PATIENT: There's not as severe.
DOCTOR: A little shorter okay.  This thigh up in the air, good and this one, ooh, you okay, got the hip huh.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry about that.  Give me a good squeeze, okay pull me towards you, now push me away good.  Arms up like this, nice and strong.
PATIENT: Careful of that.
DOCTOR: Yeah you got that the shoulder, huh?
PATIENT: The right one.
DOCTOR: Oh this one okay.  Pretty good strength though, good.  Go ahead and relax.  Can you shrug your shoulders up, okay.  Can you put your arms up to your sides?  A little stiff.
PATIENT: That's as far as they go.
DOCTOR: Okay go ahead and relax, good.  Puff out your cheeks, all the way out like you’re blowing a candle.  There you go.  Stick your tongue out and to the right, to the left.  Let me see your teeth, good.  Now squint your eyes closed real tight for me, good.  Open them up.  Feel the same on both sides of your face?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Chin to your chest like this and head all look at the ceiling.  A little stiffness in the neck.
PATIENT: A lot of stiffness.
DOCTOR: A lot of stiffness in the neck.  Can you turn your head towards the door and resist me, turn your head, keep going good and that side good okay.  Need a quick listen to your neck and then we'll be done here.  Turn back towards the door there and hold your breath.  Okay let it out, turn towards me and hold your breath again.  Okay good.  Alright go ahead and sit back down.  Do you have any trouble with your stools when you're having one of these stomach episodes?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay and does anything tend to make it better or does it go away on its own?
PATIENT: Well it doesn't hurt when I sit and it doesn't hurt when I lie down.
DOCTOR: So it's when you're up and about.
PATIENT: So I go back to bed.
DOCTOR: Oh I see okay and then when you get up again do you just feel better?
PATIENT: I don't get up until it does get better.
DOCTOR: I see okay.
PATIENT: But they used to last 11 hours, almost to the time.
DOCTOR: Yeah I remember you were having more problems with them.
PATIENT: But now I had a slight one yesterday when I went to my family doctor and he set up and I'm sorry I didn't write that, you wrote it down but you wouldn't remember it, what test he's giving me but there's a lower abdomen.  He's wondering about a artery blockage or something.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: So I'm waiting for the hospital, the La Grange Hospital to call me to go over for a test.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That he called for but I can't tell you what it is because the name is unbelievable.  It's not something simple thing like lower stomach check.
DOCTOR: So they're working that up with your primary care, okay.  Just let me know, you know what happens or if you need us to do anything here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's just make sure we're up-to-date on all our other health stuff um.  Have you had a colonoscopy in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah I used to take company physicals every year.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Q091
That was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I haven't had one in 20 some years.
DOCTOR: We don't, there's a certain age at which we stop doing those.
PATIENT: Well that's what my doctor said.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I don't think we need to worry about it.  I was just wondering if there'd been one done because of the stomach pain okay so.
PATIENT: Depending on what he finds he may want to do more so.
DOCTOR: Okay and then let's just double check where we have with the immunizations, flu shot, pneumonia, tetanus and everything is up-to-date.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So good and did we ever, were you a smoker in the past?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Did we ever, has anybody ever looked at your um aorta, do an ultrasound of the aorta?  We usually do it for men who've had a history of smoking.  Again you're probably over the recommended age where we tend to do them but we usually start them at 65 um and just check and see if that big vessel in your belly has dilated at all.  Do you ever remember having that done?
PATIENT: I've had so many tests.
DOCTOR: I'm sure you have.
PATIENT: I don't know that that was one of them.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I think you're over the age we usually do them but I'll double check.
PATIENT: You don't show it in your records?
DOCTOR: I don't show it in ours no.
PATIENT: Cause I did something here but I don't remember what it was.  It was one of those, it's a little round.
DOCTOR: That would've been it.  Was the thing like they use when a woman's pregnant?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yep, then that's probably what it was.
PATIENT: I don't know if that was here or at La Grange Hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright we reviewed that, I thinks that's all.
PATIENT: But I did, I had that.
DOCTOR: And you have all your lab tests done with us right?  Do you get any blood work done outside?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we'll keep doing that.  We'll do some checks in six months and make sure everything is looking fine so and you're getting some blood tests done with the kidney doctor but I think.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Let me just see when that is ordered for you.
PATIENT: She said six weeks.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yep so I'll double check and you know if nothing's been done in six months we'll just kind of update everything but it sounds like they're actually following you pretty closely too with the blood tests.
SECOND PERSON Q091
They're very good at that.
DOCTOR: Yeah good.  Um and I think we talked about everything else um.  I just have to run everything by my attending before we let you go but is there anything else you wanted to bring up or any concerns you have?
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON Q091
No I think we've covered everything.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You've done a good job.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Covering it today.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  Well let me just go run everything by her um.
PATIENT: Who is she?
DOCTOR: She DOCTOR is the attending that supervises the clinics or we have two of them DOCTOR um and we just run everything by them before we let you head out and I'll just double check the blood pressure thing.  I don't think I want to add anything just because sometimes you're just fine or even low and I don't want you to be much lower.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm confused too because I think I been, I don't think the blood pressure machine has been correct.
DOCTOR: Maybe now that you have your new one.
PATIENT: Maybe it'll, I hope that one's correct although it was off yesterday when I took it.
DOCTOR: And we'll start the, we'll start the valsartan try a morning dose and see if that makes you a little more stable throughout the day.
PATIENT: And you've got uh 160 in the morning.
DOCTOR: 160 in the morning.
PATIENT: And either 80 or 160 at night.
DOCTOR: Right depending on what you see in your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well let me just go double check everything with my attending might have another suggestion so I'll just be back in a few minutes okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  61:57  DOCTOR IN:  81:29)
DOCTOR: Okay, sorry that took a while.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Okay.
DOCTOR: I know you guys are ready to go so, we just talked a little bit about your blood pressure um and I think what we're gonna do is like I told you we're gonna start taking the valsartan in the morning, that two pills in the morning and then um as needed depending on what your blood pressure is running that day, take one or two then 12 hours later in the meantime and then when you follow up with DOCTOR next month then you can show her what you're getting at home and they can decide if they want to add anything else or if we want to just keep you where you are okay.  And then the other question I have for you, which we talked about that last time and I forgot to ask you was, is that gabapentin helping at all?  Do you feel?  With the pain?
PATIENT: You know I wouldn't know unless I quit taking it.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know we talked last time that maybe it wasn't, wasn't really doing much for you and we were gonna see how it went.  You were put on that for the arthritis or for do we really know?
PATIENT: Well I was going to a pain doctor and at one time they were gonna install, they tried that device where they put the wires up on both sides of the spinal cord and then you have a remote control controlling vibrations and if it worked it was on the outside and if it worked they were gonna implant it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And we got to that stage and then I had that angina attack and they had to put in a splint and then they decided they wouldn't do that at all.
DOCTOR: Well did you feel like that was working?
PATIENT: Uh, actually I quit using the outside stimulator because I didn't, it helped when I had the severe pain but the Vicodin started handling it and the exercise started taking care of that pain pretty good so I.
DOCTOR: Do you want to try to get off the gabapentin?  I mean if you're not having a lot of nerve pain then we can.
PATIENT: What's nerve?  How.
DOCTOR: You know with the numbness, burning, tingling pain fingers, toes, shooting pains that go down the legs into the feet or down the back, into the buttocks um.
PATIENT: Nope don't have any of that.
DOCTOR: Um sort of like um more of a burning inner pain than uh like a.
PATIENT: Alright there you've got that set up, they're not sending all of these automatically are they?
DOCTOR: No I think you have to call when you run out, even.
PATIENT: Okay but I.
DOCTOR: But I think.
PATIENT: The one that I ran out of was.
DOCTOR: Which one did you run out?  Oh I see what you're saying um so the cetirizine you'll get automatically because it's a new medicine.  The other ones I think what I did was just renew and so if you find that you're getting low on the pills just call them and say hey I need them by next refill.  You have plenty of refills now and you'll be getting 90 day amounts.
PATIENT: Okay so.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Maybe I should quit the gabapentin and see what happens.
DOCTOR: I was going to ask you, that gives you one less pill to take.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We could see, sometimes gabapentin makes people feel a little tired.  I don't know if that's been a problem but it might give you more, I don't know so.
PATIENT: Yeah I fall asleep reading the paper.
DOCTOR: So we could give it a try.  The way we do it is you're taking 300 mg twice a day, what I would suggest is we usually taper it so you don't stop cold turkey.  Um take one pill for about a week, just to let your body get accustomed to it and then we can probably stop it completely.  You're not on a very high dose.  We can actually have, gabapentin can be a very high dose for people with a lot of nerve pain.  But with arthritis we don’t really see a lot of nerve pain, we see more of an inflammation pain, an achy pain and with nerve issues we see a lot of people with diabetes or things like that and you don't have any issues with those types of things so.
PATIENT: Alright I'll.
DOCTOR: You can give it a shot.
PATIENT: I'll cut it back to one and see if it makes.
DOCTOR: Cut it back to one and if you start to feel like your pain is getting worse, then by all means we can keep it on there.  There's no real side effects or toxicities to gabapentin so if its.
PATIENT: Except sleepiness.
DOCTOR: Of the gabapentin yes.
PATIENT: This is one of the things that bothers me.
DOCTOR: You do, it can cause some sleepiness.  Vicodin can cause a little sleepiness too.  The Vicodin pills can do that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So
SECOND PERSON Q091
Okay.
DOCTOR: So you know try it and see how you feel.  If you don't notice any difference after a week just stop, stop the medicine completely.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay um and then you don’t have to call.  I'll keep it on your list for now just in case but you don't have to call for a refill if you're not using it obviously and so the next time you come we'll discontinue it completely if you're not taking it.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Cetirizine?
DOCTOR: Right.
SECOND PERSON Q091
So what does that do?
DOCTOR: Uh so its, its for allergies.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Is that the new one?
DOCTOR: That was the new one.
SECOND PERSON Q091
The one you were adding.
DOCTOR: It's, you've heard of it as Zyrtec, yeah that would be a 10 mg pill that you can just take one time.
PATIENT: Oh that and the one that I'm out of which was the uh.
DOCTOR: The vitamin D.
PATIENT: Vitamin D.
DOCTOR: That one should be on its way.  If you don't get it in the next week, call them, call the Pharmacy.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay cause it should be coming.  You have a little time.  You said you took your last one on the 15th.
PATIENT: Yeah the 15th.
DOCTOR: So call them in the next week if you don't see it in the mail okay.  And the Zyrtec just take it, you know, once a day.  If your allergies seem to be worse when you wake up in the morning take it when you get up in the morning and it should last you throughout the day okay.
PATIENT: Is that quick acting?
DOCTOR: Uh it should start taking effect in the first half hour to hour you take it.
PATIENT: Sometimes my nose runs all day long.
DOCTOR: Yeah um and you can use over-the-counter stuff too if you have a lot of.
PATIENT: Yeah there was one I read that said if you have glaucoma ask your doctor before using it and that was the one I got at Cosco.
DOCTOR: Which one was that?
PATIENT: They called it an allergy pill.
DOCTOR: Oh just.
PATIENT: They don't have a name on it.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Allergy.
DOCTOR: Well bring it in next time if you want to talk about it cause I'll need to see what ingredients are in it and we can talk to the eye doctors about that okay.
PATIENT: So I haven't wanted to take that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And that made me sleepy if I remember.
DOCTOR: Allergy pills can sometimes make you a little sleepy.  They can also make you feel a little bit dry cause.
PATIENT: I have yeah.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: Is this what I'm getting, also make you sleepy?
DOCTOR: I don't think so.  I think this one is a good one for the daytime um let me just see, I'm looking at the side effects.  There are like some of those decongestants out there they recommend you only take them at night um.  So yeah some people can be drowsy.  So see how you feel, you can take a half also of this medication.  If it works you can just have a half, 5 mg.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh and see how that goes okay.  Any other questions for me?
SECOND PERSON Q091
I actually feel great.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well, just call me if anything comes up okay.
PATIENT: That's a joke.
DOCTOR: Well I know but what you can do is call the scheduling number.  I admit it doesn’t always work, call the general clinic schedule number and say I want to leave a message for DOCTOR and they will send me an e-mail and I'll be able to get back to you in the next couple days.  If not.
PATIENT: You're only in here on.
DOCTOR: I'm only in here for one week and then I'll be [REDACTED] four weeks and then I'm in [REDACTED] and then I'll be back in five weeks.  So I'm here one week out of every five.
SECOND PERSON Q091
Hmm.
DOCTOR: Is how it works now?
PATIENT: So check your e-mail.
DOCTOR: But I still get my e-mails even when I'm in the hospital and I can give you, I can call you without a problem okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So they'll schedule you for my clinic um, what do you, do you come every six months to see me?
SECOND PERSON Q091
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Is that right?  So that'll be around September time and like I said we'll look for some labs.  I'll look at the labs and see if you, you know.
PATIENT: I usually have blood tests before.
DOCTOR: It worked well that way because then we can go over them when you're here.  So plan on a couple weeks for the blood tests.  Let's see uh yes.
