DOCTOR: DOCTOR.  And then she sent you to the eye doctor and the foot doctor.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Fine.  How um, how have your sugars been?
PATIENT: She can tell you everything.
THIRD PERSON V613
No I've been testing his blood pressures.  He has not been testing his sugars.  So I got a record of his blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Oh perfect.
THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's my doctor at home.
DOCTOR: Oh good.
THIRD PERSON V613
And this medicine they [REDACTED].  I believe DOCTOR took him off of it.
DOCTOR: Yeah. Let’s see.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: His blood pressure looks good.  I know they're a little higher today.
THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh, thank you.
DOCTOR: What we could do.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: We could all be so lucky to have a doctor at home.
PATIENT: She's not the doctor.  She make sure what time I'm gonna take my medicine or I got a sweet wife.
DOCTOR: It looks like he didn’t take you off it.
PATIENT: See so I called.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: To get it.
DOCTOR: Yeah refilled and then they didn't want to yeah.
PATIENT: They said we don't have that number and that was it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We'll refill, I'm gonna refill that for you.  Okay it looks like he had it on the record like it's supposed to be on there.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.  Thank you.
PATIENT: They can send it out right?
DOCTOR: Okay.  They do, so you didn't take this this morning right?
THIRD PERSON V613
No.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay and yesterday neither?
THIRD PERSON V613
We haven't had it for two weeks or more.
PATIENT: Past two weeks.
DOCTOR: Two weeks.
THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Right.
THIRD PERSON V613
He’s been doing good, though.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We may just add on the.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I called about this.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they said we don't have it on record.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And I know your sugars were good back in December too they were saying.  They had checked kind of a three month period.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay right.
DOCTOR: That looked good.  I think we may check another one today to see how your sugars have been.  It's a blood test that they check to see how your sugars have been averaging over the last three months.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll do that today too.
THIRD PERSON V613
Now they said for PATIENT to take just the insulin at home, that is the 35 units he takes at night.  He doesn't do good when he has to take that at night.
DOCTOR: In the morning.
THIRD PERSON V613
Right.  What I had did when he first started on it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
THIRD PERSON V613
I was giving it to him in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's okay.
THIRD PERDON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: That's okay cause that should be the last thing I believe, quite some time Aspart in the morning.  That's fine.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: In the morning is fine as long.
THIRD PERSON V613
Thank you.
DOCTOR: Since his sugars looked okay um back in September so I'm okay with keeping that level of insulin.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay thank you.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh so we'll keep that as well.  And I know you saw the eye doctor and the foot doctor so that's good and how's your knee?
PATIENT: Don’t talk to me about these damn feet.  What it is, they stiffen up.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it's hard to get, see you have to push up.  Now that was just a little easy but they’re stiff.
DOCTOR: They’re really stiff, okay.
PATIENT: And they said that they're not gonna put new ones in there.
DOCTOR: What they, they said yeah.
PATIENT: They did somehing they get, it’s  harder to get up.
DOCTOR: It gets hard to get up okay.  I think one of the things that they were recommending was to set you up with the physical therapist to see if we can get you know some sort of stretches or something to kind of help you [REDACTED] the muscles around there to see if maybe it would make it a little easier.
PATIENT: I gotta do something with it.
DOCTOR: So I'd like to send you back to see if you need to see the physical therapist okay to see you know what they can do to help you out there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And get you a little bit yeah okay.
THIRD PERSON V613
Because he has a very hard time getting up at home too.
DOCTOR: Sure, I saw that.
THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It took you a while to get up out of the chair.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
PATIENT: It takes me longer than that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause that chair hits me right in the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Sure okay.  And then let me check to make sure you have.  Any other medications that needs to be refilled?
THIRD PERSON V613
No, no.
PATIENT: No.
THIRD PERSON V613
Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay and um and your blood tests back in September looked pretty good and we only check them out once every few months anyway.  The only one is the one for the diabetes to see how your sugars have been and if we need to adjust anything.
PATIENT: I feel fine.  I'm not gonna take beat around the bush cause some guys say they feel fine and they don’t then.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And my wife looks out after me too.
THIRD PERSON V613
Yeah I do.
DOCTOR: Good.  [REDACTED] and I know they sent you for the, let me check and see how your, how the blood flow was in your legs too.
THIRD PERSON V613
That's correct.
DOCTOR: Your right leg looks good.  You just have a little bit of; you know how they say in the heart arteries you can have some plaque build up?
THIRD PERSON V613
Right.
DOCTOR: Well on the left side you did have a little bit.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so, one other things [REDACTED] I'm gonna check it.  You're already on the aspirin which is what we would recommend doing for that anyway.
THIRD PERSON V613
That's good to know.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: But when its, she's the one who knows all of my medicines.
THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know, DOCTOR called.
THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.  Yeah for management.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].

THIRD PERSON V613

DOCTOR: Oh it's a chair.
THIRD PERSON V613
Yeah.  I want a chair that's leather.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
THIRD PERSON V613
And that thing, it would tear your furniture.

PATIENT: Okay.
THIRD PERSON V613

THIRD PERSON V613

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: Any fevers or anything like that at home?
PATIENT: No not that I know of no fevers.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.  Nice deep breaths.  Deep breath again and again.  Any pain back here at all?
PATIENT: No pain.  Well down here in my.
THIRD PERSON V613

PATIENT: Down here in my back it sometimes hurts [REDACTED].  But that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Just breathe normally.  Any belly pain, trouble eating?
PATIENT: I don't have a problem.
DOCTOR: Any changes or anything like that?
THIRD PERSON V613

THIRD PERSON V613

THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Alright and you can have this back.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay thank you.
(DOCTOR OUT:  45:52  DOCTOR IN:  49:18)
DOCTOR: Okay so the deal with the chair is that they want to see you first, the physical therapists.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: They want to do their evaluation but we may be able to get you that were placed and see if you can go up and have you talk with them first but if not then they um, they will get you the appointment as soon as possible and get you evaluated for that.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  Give me one second let me just put in some of the orders here and then I can see if I can, if I can order it I'll do it but it sounds like from what I  heard from the other doctors they have to do the formal evaluation.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: Before they issue that.
THIRD PERSON V613
You know I have Humana health insurance and the man wanted to sign PATIENT up just in case something happens, something happens when we can't get over here at night.  Will he lose his VA if he signed up for that?
DOCTOR: That I don't know.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: That either we'll have to; you'll have to check with the Finance Office or something.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: That's something that I don't know.
THIRD PERSON V613
Oh okay.
DOCTOR: I actually don't know the answer to that unfortunately.
THIRD PERSON V613
Thank you.
DOCTOR: So.
THIRD PERSON V613
If nothing I'll just call, call someone who calls me back, it's better to know.  Cause I want to find medicine [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So you want to pick it up here or do you want it mailed to you?
THIRD PERSON V613
Uh you can mail it.
PATIENT: Mail it.
DOCTOR: Mail it okay.
THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Change this other one.
THIRD PERSON V613
So far they mail out everything his insulin and everything.
DOCTOR: Sure.  Okay I just wanted to make sure.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay cause he'll need the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we don't uh do the renewals on most of these medicines, some of them in the chart are coming up.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: So that you know just when you need to call it in they will have it.
THIRD PERSON V613
Oh okay, thank you.
DOCTOR: Any questions about anything else?
PATIENT: Something with my back, that's what I told you about my back with you know a while back.  That's.
THIRD PERSON V613
[REDACTED] arthritis in your lower back.  But I think, I hear that arthritis can be cured.
DOCTOR: It depends on what type of kind of arthritis.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: Sometimes it’s surgical.
THIRD PERSON V613
Oh okay.
DOCTOR: But in the meantime since we're gonna send you to Physical Therapy for your knee anyway we'll have them see what they can do about your back and kind of strengthen the back muscles – the joints.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause usually we start there first and sometimes that'll help you know so.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.  And when do the grownups start to get the whooping cough?
DOCTOR: When your cough doesn't go away for a few months.
THIRD PERSON V613
Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
THIRD PERSON V613
A few months.
DOCTOR: That's the sort of thing that, because everybody gets the shot as a kid.
THIRD PERSON V613
Right.
DOCTOR: Um but you know sometimes they recommend getting another one.
THIRD PERSON V613
Oh okay.
DOCTOR: At some point.  Um if your cold doesn't get better in a couple of weeks come on back and we'll take an x-ray and see what's going on.
PATIENT: See my back is.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm sorry.
PATIENT: See my back.
DOCTOR: If your cough.
PATIENT: It's just a cold.
DOCTOR: If your cold.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Runny nose and all that doesn't get better in a couple of weeks, come on back okay.  They'll see you.  There's always the Walk-In Clinic too that you can’t do is.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright give me one second.  And then we should probably make sure of the phone number NUMBER?
THIRD PERSON V613
That's correct.
PATIENT: That's it.
DOCTOR: We'll give you a call if we need to adjust your insulin if when the find the A1c, the three months average comes back [REDACTED].
THIRD PERSON V613

DOCTOR: Good. I put in an equipment request.
THIRD PERSON V613
Hmm.
DOCTOR: And one other thing the 25 to 35 um and she can try to pick up something like that uh today.  Um if they say no then what we'll do is we'll wait for the evaluation. There’s going to be two parts, the therapist's evaluation to kind of see what they can do about your knee and the back.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.
DOCTOR: And then um the, the uh, the other evaluation to see what kind of equipment that I can order you before.
THIRD PERSON V613
Okay. Thank you.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Oh I forgot all about that thing.
THIRD PERSON V613
