PATIENT: For my stomach, let's see.  I have so many pills.
DOCTOR: The omeprazole the one for your reflux.
PATIENT: Is that a little white pill?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I take it at night.
DOCTOR: What are you doing taking it at night cause you're not eating it isn't doing any good?  It works better to take them during the day.
PATIENT: I could switch it around and take them all in the day.  I want to be able to take them all at the same time.
DOCTOR: Um let's see.  I guess the only one, I mean you just want to make sure you don't forget and your blood pressure right now, I don't know if it's because you're not taking it or if it's not working.
PATIENT: No it's working cause the last.
DOCTOR: The last one was a good one.

PATIENT: Mail them cause I need to get to the cashier before 4 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Do you need insulin too?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Do you need everything refilled?
PATIENT: I remember about them telling me about the insulin that I was warned that it could pull, I been taking it and it would be too much for me.
DOCTOR: What do you mean?
PATIENT: In other words insulin brings down your blood sugar correct?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay.  You were concerned if I would be taking the insulin bringing it down too low.
DOCTOR: Um well the last time we did the hemoglobin test it was really good to the point where maybe it’s too good.
PATIENT: It's too good?  Alright I cut back on the insulin like every other day.
DOCTOR: What are you using right now?
PATIENT: 30 units Humulin N.
DOCTOR: Oh and how long were you doing this?
PATIENT: If I go back to shooting myself every day you better order me another bottle because I went back to taking it every other day.
DOCTOR: So what are you doing right now?
PATIENT: Every other day.  I'm going to go back to taking it.
DOCTOR: Once a day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's it?
PATIENT: Right, that's what I'm going to go back to taking it once a day instead of every other day.
DOCTOR: How about this, give me your phone number, we'll check today to see what your sugar has been in the last three months.  If it's a lot worse then we'll go back to every day okay.  So keep doing what you're doing now.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then I'll call you and let you know what to do.
PATIENT: Okay you have my phone number don't you?
DOCTOR: Is it the same one?
PATIENT: Yeah it hasn't changed.
DOCTOR: Uh NUMBER.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: NUMBER.
PATIENT: That's it, that's it.
DOCTOR: So fill this one and this one.  If you give yourself insulin though you really need to check your sugars every other day.  You can’t just give yourself insulin without making sure.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Cause what if it's low.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: You could go into a coma.
PATIENT: Yeah but you know when it goes low you, I mean you'll know it.  You know you'll feel weak, tired.
DOCTOR: Yeah but.
PATIENT: For you I will take it every other day.
DOCTOR: Are you going to pick them up?
PATIENT: No mail everything.  I got to get to the cashier before 4 o'clock so I have child expenses to pay back home.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause they don't stay open when you got 3 o'clock appointments, they close at 4 sharp.  Is it normal for me to be tired when I wake up in the morning cause by 11 o'clock then I'm ready to go?  You know I have energy.
DOCTOR: Are you sleeping okay?

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's for the heart.  I never thought I had any heart problems.
DOCTOR: And you’re diabetic so it's kind of like having heart problems even though you don't.
PATIENT: Oh right, I'll go back to taking the aspirin.
DOCTOR: Do you want to get it here; do you want me to order it?
PATIENT: Uh yeah you can put it on there, they can mail it.  That'll save me from going to the drug store.
