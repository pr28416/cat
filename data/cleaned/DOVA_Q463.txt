DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Hi how you doing?
PATIENT: Fine how are you?
DOCTOR: Alright.  I didn't know that they were doing the surgery that quick.
PATIENT: Surprised huh?
DOCTOR: Yeah and I know that they were talking about you had a follow-up [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah they uh, well there was confusion cause actually in October I said let's go forward with it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And somehow it got screwed up and it didn't actually end up when I wanted to do it cause I wanted to do it in December.  They were telling me it was gonna be two months worth of therapy and whatever and I just figured.
DOCTOR: Do it during the winter.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But there wasn't that much weather, we didn't have a winter.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's right.  So you were up doing on the Rehab Floor for a little while too?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh how are things going, for instance are you able to walk around?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The only reason I'm using the walker is between downstairs and the Rehab, up here and back down and whatever [REDACTED] here but um yeah I'm not up to walking that much yet.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  When do you have follow up with the surgeons?
PATIENT: Uh the 6th of April I believe it is.
DOCTOR: Okay that's like a couple of weeks.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright and I also saw you were in the ER just last week.
PATIENT: Yep urinary tract infection, which they said was probably due to the catheter [REDACTED] while I was in the service.
DOCTOR: Yeah, probably.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Are you still taking the antibiotics yet?
PATIENT: Uh yeah I got four more pills.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Your blood pressure looks good today.  It's been you know, our main concern was the aneurysm.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So you're still going to have good blood pressure.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: It still looks good today.
PATIENT: And uh the other thing that I am taking as far as the medications that they’ve got me listed for, I'm taking the amlodipine.
DOCTOR: 10 mg?
PATIENT: Yep.  The metoprolol.
DOCTOR: 100 twice a day?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And uh the calcium.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then I'm finishing out the antibiotics.  I'm not taking any of the other medications.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you're not taking the lisinopril?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Okay and you're not taking simvastatin?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Changed my diet, I'm eating less than, staying off of the red meat, four or five times a week at the most.  I'm eating mostly fish and chicken and a lot of nuts and grains and stuff generally to watch the cholesterol that way.  I just don't want to be on the cholesterol medications.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Was your cholesterol pretty bad before?
PATIENT: No.  Everything you gave me was just to reduce the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Are you still having problems with your vision in the left eye?
PATIENT: Oh a little.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Nothing.
DOCTOR: Are you still seeing the eye doc?
PATIENT: I'm probably due to for another appointment, he told me to come back in the spring of this year so, I'm probably due.
DOCTOR: You know I wonder if it's not, let me see what the surgeon said.  You're blood pressure's not bad but your pulse is a little bit low, 56 cause before it would have been ideal.  Uh do you ever feel like you get pauses in your, like do you ever get lightheaded or dizzy?
PATIENT: I'm [REDACTED] today but that seemed like when I work out and they're trying to get me straightened out.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Other than that no.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And the, I'm gonna say the metoprolol um if I end up taking it within a 12 hour span, my uh pulse seems to be much more stronger and I think increased in rate as well.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Did you ever do those cards?
PATIENT: Yeah I sent them in.
DOCTOR: The cards I sent, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I figured no news was good news.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I don't see it at all.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: How are you feeling in terms of [REDACTED] urination with the prostate?
PATIENT: Fine.  I mean I'm probably up a little more often than usual.  At night I'm probably up twice during the night but I don't have any problem going or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Well it looks like your PSA has been up a little bit, the numbers that we check the prostate with.  [REDACTED].  When was the last time I saw you?
PATIENT: Uh I believe it was in October, probably I think the 7th.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  This February your PSA was a 7, up from 5 back in 2010.  That's not a huge jump.
PATIENT: Uh also when they put me on a mostly regimented medication, I stop taking my saw palmetto.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Were you ever, did we ever have you on finasteride or Flomax?
PATIENT: Uh no I was on Flomax with my other doctor for a while.
DOCTOR: How many times in the night do you get up and use the bathroom?
PATIENT: Usually once.
DOCTOR: No weak stream or hesitancy?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do ever feel like your bladder is full and you can’t empty it?
PATIENT: Never.  When I gotta go, I gotta go and it's over.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Did you ever see the urologist?
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: They were supposed to do that chest CT some time around now to see if that mass has changed.
PATIENT: They did a CT just prior to the surgery.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And they said that they basically should be able to see if from that.  I believe it would've been February 10th.
DOCTOR: I see one January 13th, preop, so that was for the preop work-up.  Okay it looks like it was unchanged.  Well maybe they called that one mass at the outside hospital at a centimeter and a half and then when we rechecked it, it was down to 5 millimeters, it was about a third of the size and then now it's down to 3-4 millimeters so it's probably something we'd want to check again.  It's certainly not getting bigger, if anything it's getting smaller so.  Are you still taking the aspirin?
PATIENT: I haven't been, they didn't want me to take it before surgery and I haven't started taking it again.
DOCTOR: What about that bacteria that grew out of your urine was susceptible to the antibiotic [REDACTED].  And you didn't have fevers, chills or anything like that, any back, low back pain?
PATIENT: Yeah after therapy.
DOCTOR: After therapy alright, okay.  How are you doing with your medicines, do you have plenty of refills?
PATIENT: Yeah and just when I went to the hospital they gave me another pile of them plus I had them at home so I'm good for a couple of three months.
DOCTOR: I'll take a look at you.  Have you been having any chest pain or trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: You can have a seat right there.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Big, deep breath.  Any swelling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Is there still a surgical scar?
PATIENT: Yeah, come on now. You don’t need to ask that, do  you?
DOCTOR: Oh gee that's healing nice.  Got those stitches already out, already healed up. So you haven't noticed any drainage or anything like that out of it?
PATIENT: Um a couple times there was a little but once the stitches were it seemed like it was all over but that was the way it was [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No it looks good.  Well you know, it's probably not a terrible pain that you quit taking the lisinopril.  The only thing I worry about is the metoprolol is what's called beta blockers and actually we use that to slow down people's heart rate and the blood pressure so we were [REDACTED] pretty high for you.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So my question becomes maybe the lisinopril would be better than metoprolol because, it’s only once a day because it slows your heart down a bit.  It's probably good to cut back on the dose of [REDACTED].  I'll kind of run that by my boss today.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Let's see [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Now the um metoprolol um like you say if I go taking it as an unusual problem or something I end up like 14 hours between the pills then uh I mean I noticed my heartbeat significantly different.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: Is there a um a point where that would back off, I mean.
DOCTOR: Is it painful?
PATIENT: No because it's, I mean I can feel it.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Rather than, the when the [REDACTED] like right now I don't even feel it, but like I say if I go 14 or 15 hours without it, uh I mean I have gone uh like on a trip or something and gone 18 hours then obviously it doesn't seem to get any worse or I just, I don't know what that it gets any better, I never really paid any attention.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  When was the last time you saw Cardiology?
PATIENT: I’m not sure, it’s been a year.
DOCTOR: Alright give me about five minutes so I can go chat with my boss real quick.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back.
PATIENT: No problem.
(DOCTOR OUT:  43:25  DOCTOR IN:  51:00)
DOCTOR: Alright.  Well here's what I want to do.  Blood pressure is really good.  We're shooting for less than 130 and we certainly got that on the top number.  The bottom number is actually a little bit low.  But if you don't have any symptoms, it's probably not a huge deal but kind of like this low number and your pulse rate being a little bit low, you're just kind of on the fence so.  We'll just stick with this.  You're not taking lisinopril right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So thinking about maybe just cutting back on the metoprolol.  So you're taking 100.
PATIENT: It's a split pill, just got to break it in half.
DOCTOR: Are you asking me?  Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So yeah, right now you're taking a pill twice a day so just take a half pill twice a day.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Should be 12 hours though.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Uh so we'll monitor you after that.  And the simvastatin if you don't want to take it and you want to try the diet and exercise I think that's okay.
PATIENT: The exercise is definitely gonna help because I didn't exercise at all before and now at least I'm back to.
DOCTOR: And you're right on the borderline of your goal cholesterol so you know I don't think there's any problem.
PATIENT: How's my good cholesterol?
DOCTOR: We haven't, we didn't check it.  We'll probably check it next time because you're on the borderline.  You know I honestly would like to see you on the medication but with diet and exercise it may come down but the next time you come back we'll check it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That’s fair. Next time, I'll see if I can't do it with diet and exercise then I'm okay with it.  Cause I used to be on it and still it was up cause then you will know.  You don’t know if diet and exercise aren't doing it, the pills are doing it.
DOCTOR: Um and then [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] 55 miles.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]
PATIENT: [REDACTED] up near the Wisconsin border.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um so I don't need to see you back for maybe about three months.  I would like for you to come back in the next two or three weeks to take a blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, that might work cause I'm coming in twice a week for therapy.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, alright good.  So you'll be here next week?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: So we'll check it next week.  [REDACTED] you can get it done before you go to therapy just come up here and tell the nurses you're here for a blood pressure check and she'll take your blood pressure and you go and you won't have to wait.
PATIENT: Okay yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  We're basically cutting the metoprolol in half so I want to make sure it doesn't go high now you know.  I don't think it will but we'll check it and I think it'll be fine but.
PATIENT: Oh if I notice any really change in the heart rate or anything I guess I'll call and tell you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Yeah, tell me if you have any symptoms.  So those stool cards, I don't know what happened.  I think there's [REDACTED] because your blood count was so low that and [REDACTED], they probably wouldn't accept them anyway and that may be what happened but you actually need the actual colonoscopy so.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Let's wait till I get straightened out a little bit here first.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, we will wait on that for a few months okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me, give me just a couple more minutes.
PATIENT: Pardon?
(DOCTOR OUT:  56:02  DOCTOR IN:  60:16)
DOCTOR: Alright.  The only real change we’re making is the half a pill.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Otherwise, I'll see you back in about four months and you've got a follow-up with the surgeons right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  And plenty of physical therapy.
PATIENT: Yep.  That's my goal.  My goal is to not run a marathon, not to go square dancing, just to get to stand up and walk again.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I'm getting there.
DOCTOR: Um next time you come in we'll check, we'll check your cholesterol and we'll check your blood count.  You know your blood count's low.  It's probably because you had the surgery and you lose blood whenever you have a surgery and that can make it low.
PATIENT: I actually got a transfusion and iron because it was low.
DOCTOR: Yeah so um, it probably was a little bit low but we'll see where it's at compared to today um.
PATIENT: And they took four vials of blood on Saturday in the Emergency Room I don't know what they were checking for but you should have some information.
DOCTOR: These are going to be four months from now so uh, yeah you don't have to worry about this before the next appointment and we'll be able to do some labs.  Uh you know, we're going to check it, PSA [REDACTED] it didn’t go up high, it is pretty pretty high but.
PATIENT: It's always been high.
DOCTOR: Exactly so I mean, it could be prostate cancer but given you've had no BPH.
PATIENT: My original position.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I was at 9.8.
DOCTOR: That's what I mean, I mean sometimes we can see a bump because you had other, [REDACTED] in February you were in the hospital so if you had a catheter in that trauma can raise your [REDACTED] so we'll check your PSA again when you come back in four months and that should give your prostate some time to settle down.
PATIENT: And I'll go back on the saw palmetto and see what.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Now it was 9.8, that would have been probably maybe 12 years ago, I went on saw palmetto then and it dropped it from 9.8 to 3.4.
DOCTOR: Oh is that right?  Well we'll see what happens then.  Alright I think everything is fine.  Alright so we'll see you back in four months.  Good luck with the uh with the therapy.
PATIENT: Yeah, I’ll be walking by then, next time I won’t be using the chair. Well I said maybe, I'll definitely be doing it, can [REDACTED] maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright, do you want me to show you the way out?
PATIENT: Yeah if you don't mind, I don't want to tear your doors up and everything else.
DOCTOR: Sure.  I'm going to see you now.
PATIENT: And check out at this.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.  Forward I can do pretty good.  Backwards I don't have a rearview mirror.
DOCTOR: Alright, will you be okay from here?
PATIENT: Yeah thanks doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright no problem.  We'll see you later okay.
PATIENT: Yep.
PATIENT: 64:04.
Time is 1:35.
