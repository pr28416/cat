I have this pretty bad headache that started like probably a week ago, and then for the last few days I've been having these chills. Um, and I didn't get a chance to measure my temperature at all, um, but the worst thing has been just these muscle aches all over my body, and that's been going on for the last three to four days.
DOCTOR: Sorry to hear that you're feeling so, uh, horrible over the past week. Um let's uh, let's try to understand this a little bit better. So you've had this headache for the past week or so. Where exactly is it?

DOCTOR: Okay, and what does it feel like? How would you describe it?
PATIENT: Uh yeah, it feels like, kind of like uh aching um, I, I have had headaches with throbbing before, but it's not so much throbbing it's more just constant, aching pain.
DOCTOR: Um, if you had to give it a number from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst um, pain ever, what number would you give it?

PATIENT: No, I haven't, uh, I've been having chills for the last few nights.
DOCTOR: Yeah, we can definitely check your temperature here in the, um here. Um, and you mentioned that the muscle aches have been quite bothersome for you. Is it all over your body or anyone, uh, in any one muscle group?
PATIENT: It seems like it's all over.

DOCTOR: Are you maintaining social distancing when you're taking your mask off?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's uh, most of the times we're pretty socially distanced when we're eating, but sometimes it's like hard to control when you know, when you're going near the microwave to heat up your food, and sometimes it gets hard. It's a, it's a fairly small room, so.
DOCTOR: Yeah, well I would, I would recommend that you try to eat when people are not in the room if possible because you are putting yourself at risk.  Like if it's a small room, I think you should also talk to management or try to limit the number of people who can be in the room at a time. Um, for your own safety, you know, and for the safety of others uh, working with you. Um okay, and um, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, we've been uh, at home.

DOCTOR: Okay, alright, um so it sounds like you've had a headache for the past week, which has been kind of constant, about 7 out of 10. And then you've also developed a fever, but you haven't, or I guess you've been feeling, you've been having chills uh, and we can measure temperature here, and you also had a cough that started yesterday. What about um, sense of taste? Have you noticed any changes there?
PATIENT: Uh, no, not that I've really noticed.
DOCTOR: What about your sense of smell?
PATIENT: Um, my smell, I don't think so, but like sometimes I do feel a bit, like stuffy as well. Like not, not right now, but before when I felt stuffy I lost my sense of smell.
DOCTOR: Sure, yeah, okay. Um, okay well that's all the questions I have for you. We'll do a physical exam um, get a chest x-ray done, also examine your neck as well a little bit, just to make sure there's no stiffness or rigidity, have a look inside your mouth, um, listen to your chest.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We will also get a COVID swab done, simply because your symptoms sound very similar to um, or I guess a lot of these symptoms do overlap with symptoms of COVID, so we'll do that. And um, I would require, would request that you continue to uh, stay at home if you haven't been doing so so far. Um, take a leave from work, try to do work from home, and quarantine at home as much as possible and stay away from your wife and your daughter as well, at least until the swab is back and you get some more guidance from uh, public health. If it is positive, they will give you a call. Um, there are lots of guidelines on how to self isolate and I, I can share that with you. Um, it's best that you do that for now. Um, we will run a couple of tests, do labs, and based on those results, uh, we'll decide if you need to stay in the ER or if we can um, if you can be discharged later today. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Uh no that, that all sounds great. Thanks for explaining it to me.
DOCTOR: You're welcome.
PATIENT: Okay.
