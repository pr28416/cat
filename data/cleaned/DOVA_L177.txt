DOCTOR: Okay maybe you're not completely going those times that you do go.
PATIENT: I mean.
DOCTOR: Have you been.  I mean it might be because.

DOCTOR: 55:09    DOCTOR IN:  57:33
DOCTOR: Okay.  I think we're gonna, it looks like it might be like you're not completely going is my, what the issue is.  I think we need to bulk up your stool a little bit more.  It could still be from the morphine.  It might be just presenting differently in you, you know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um I'm gonna give you some fiber to take okay.  Why don't you take it for the next uh whatever month or so and see if that helps with your stool okay.  I'll mail it to you okay.

DOCTOR: Um and then if that, you know whether or not it works what not I'm gonna see you in ten weeks anyways okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: See if that works.  Alright and then if we have to go and do a colonoscopy then we'll do that but let's see if we can figure out what it is.  I mean it's like a motility problem or whatever it is okay.
