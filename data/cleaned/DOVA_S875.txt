DOCTOR: Okay.  That's good.  I understand that you have kind of some chronic pain.

DOCTOR: Okay after a car accident?
PATIENT: You know actually it’s been this way most of my life cause of the car accident and I started having these dreams and I be fighting in my sleep and they're starting to get worse.
DOCTOR: And that was all after the car accident?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well actually it was there before the car accident, started to get better and then it got worse.  So it's coming back again.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I've had these probably since at least '81, around there.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What type of dreams do you have?
PATIENT: Fighting, I'm always fighting.
DOCTOR: Who are you fighting?
PATIENT: I don't know, I'm getting jumped by people [REDACTED] you know.  Sometimes I remember them, sometimes I don't and I’m seeing a psychiatrist [REDACTED] relaxation [REDACTED] nightmares.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I have an appointment with her so.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] that's okay.  Have you um [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any thoughts of suicide or anything?
PATIENT: Yeah.  [REDACTED] but.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: It's just sometimes you know just things I can't do anymore I just you know, [REDACTED].  Time for me to give up.
DOCTOR: When did you start having these thoughts?
PATIENT: A while back.
DOCTOR: In the last couple of weeks or?
PATIENT: Maybe about a month ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What um, do you have a plan?
PATIENT: No, I don't have no plan.  I get to be in certain situations in certain areas then I think this would be a good way to go.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you plan on following through with that?
PATIENT: No.  After I think about it for a while, then I don't do it at the time and it passes and I just forget about it.  Like a couple weeks ago I was stopped by a train, so I am just sitting there, I was the first car there you know I like to think about it, just going up there and falling in between the trains and it was like I mean it was intense, and I was like, you know I could do this, you know but I don't know, the train passed, it was a long freighter so I sat there a while thinking about it and it passed and I went on my way and then later on I didn't think about it no more.  Maybe it's just like they come in spurts you know.  It's just like there's times when I'll be sitting and I'm thinking and.
DOCTOR: Do you uh when they come in spurts, do you hear any voices or anything like that?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I feel like [REDACTED] I don't know, it's like I'm not really there. I don't know how to explain.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, it's kind of like.  No, no I hear you.  Is it kind of like an out of body thing?  Like it's more kind of primal, does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Or is that not the way to describe it?
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: This is different.
PATIENT: I don't know a cycle.  I'm dreaming that I'm awake and dreaming this and you know somehow this stuff happens.  I can see myself, let's just say I can see myself walking doing these things.
DOCTOR: What are some of the [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: I don't want to talk about [REDACTED].  That's how you [REDACTED] psychiatrist [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well, let me tell you what, like I know, I know we don't know each other very well but um like I'm afraid that you might, you might walk out of here today and act on some of these.
PATIENT: Yeah, I haven't done anything yet.
DOCTOR: I know but I think that's the key thing.  I think these are some of the things I hear you're kind of reaching out to me and I want to.
PATIENT: No you're just making me think about them.
DOCTOR: No, no, no, no, but I'm not a bad guy by all means.  You know I don't but I think that these are some warning things that maybe we should um; you know maybe this could be a little bit more emergent than maybe both you and I kind of think you know.  Like I don't want tomorrow something to happen to you after I just talked to you today you know like this is my opportunity of being your doctor and you know and knowing you today to maybe step in and you know, maybe save your life you know.
PATIENT: Well I got an appointment with my doctor.
DOCTOR: I know but what if you don't make it that far?
PATIENT: Oh I'll make it.  I'll make it, I'm still, I'll go.
DOCTOR: I know but I'm a little worried so.  Have you um as far as some of the dreams have you been jumped before is this all from the war?
PATIENT: I was never in the war.  [REDACTED] in the service.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Otherwise you've been jumped before?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: By um, [REDACTED] I understand it's kind of a traumatic experience.
