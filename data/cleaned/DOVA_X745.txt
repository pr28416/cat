DOCTOR: That's good.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: That's good.  It's been a while since we checked your cholesterol.
PATIENT: I needed that checked.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm not going to do all this today am I doc?
DOCTOR: Uh no, no, no.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah so now that we're establishing this relationship when you're gonna be coming in.
PATIENT: Um you're gonna be my doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s right.
PATIENT: Doctor, how you pronounce it?
DOCTOR: DOCTOR.
PATIENT: DOCTOR, gotcha.
DOCTOR: So you know you'll come back in for the results.  We'll get you set up for the colonoscopy.  Um for the foot doctors.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And before the next time you come to see me we'll have you draw your blood.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we can see what the cholesterol is.
PATIENT: No problem, I can work with that.
DOCTOR: Um, let's see what else.  Do you smoke?
PATIENT: [REDACTED], I do.
DOCTOR: Do you want to stop?
PATIENT: I'm trying.  I smoke maybe a half a pack a day?
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I need to quit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause it's not good for my high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: It's not good period.
PATIENT: Period.  I got to take heed, doc, as of this day I'm gonna.  I don't want no gum.  What you think?  They gave me some gum but.
DOCTOR: I think every person is different.
PATIENT: I know, I uh.
DOCTOR: And your, let's just lay it all out and let's be perfectly honest with you.
PATIENT: Thank you, I would like to be.
DOCTOR: So smoking has probably been the least of your issues as far as substance abuse in general.
PATIENT: That's correct.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's correct.
DOCTOR: Um so if you are still smoking a little bit, but you are no longer using cocaine?
PATIENT: Doing heroin no.
DOCTOR: Heroin.
PATIENT: No sir, no sir.
DOCTOR: What about alcohol?
PATIENT: No sir, never been a drinker.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: That, if I drink a beer, that lead me to get into heroin.  That's a gateway to go get that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Alcohol I have all day but I go get heroin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I don't.
DOCTOR: So I mean in the short term, if smoking is a way for you to not use coke and not use heroin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Then so be it but if you are done with that, it's over and it's no longer something that ever crosses your mind once in a while.
PATIENT: That doesn't cross, I was going through that crisis and that point, but wasn't no excuse for that cause the problem was still there.  We would have had to go through but I said what am I doing, so now I just, abstain, don't go around no people place and things and I been doing good doctor.  I been doing good.
DOCTOR: Now do you feel that that's where you're at then absolutely you should work on the smoking.  Um and you know it's different.  Some people they can just stop.
PATIENT: I know.  My sister stopped.
DOCTOR: But some people you know, the gum works, there are patches that work, there's you know just kind of drawing a line in the sand saying January 1st 2011 will be the day I quit.  I mean you're gonna have to find what that is for you.
PATIENT: And you know what doc, I'm gonna try.  I tried the gum but I was psyching myself out.  That gum helped me listen, I chewed two pieces, three pieces I put in my mouth.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that whole day I didn't smoke until later on that night.  I went about nine hours so it must be working to get my mind to say don’t get one.  I smoked a couple puffs and it didn't taste right.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: So see I think that gum might work for me.
DOCTOR: Well that's good.  I mean.
PATIENT: Yeah so we gonna work together doctor cause I got to quit.  I'm 55; I'll be 56 next year.  I'm not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that's when the body needs to stop drinking and drugging.  I drug, but things start happening if you take it and I haven't used since that day and I thank God, just for the day now, one day at a time, you know how it go.  So doctor I'm doing great and I really think me being of service to my country is helping me cause if not I don't know what I would be.  I smoke though, this is it.  You know this is my start and I'm doing something for me.  I'm making the initial steps, you all are helping me, willing to help me but I got a.  I'm my worst enemy so I realize that.
DOCTOR: And best friend.
PATIENT: And best friend, so now I'm my best friend.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I want to live.  I'm honest with you doc I want to live.
DOCTOR: What's your living situation right now?
PATIENT: Um right now doc I'm up north.  I'm in a recovery home.  I'm keeping me regular, you see I got tell you I'm in a recovery home.  I leave the 14th of December.

DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: And at times it hurt but it goes away.
DOCTOR: So is it when you're walking?
PATIENT: Yeah a long time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I thought it was from that hernia but they say the hernia repair is good.
