DOCTOR: How you doing?
PATIENT: Good.  Thank you.
DOCTOR: You can have a seat right there.
PATIENT: Oh man.
DOCTOR: How you doing today?
PATIENT: Not too bad now that I've got a cold here so.
DOCTOR: What's that?  You have a cold?
PATIENT: With a cold yeah, over.
DOCTOR: When did that start?
PATIENT: A couple days ago.
DOCTOR: Couple days ago.  Just a runny nose or?
PATIENT: Yeah man sneezing and.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I feel a little bit under the weather.
DOCTOR: Any fevers?
PATIENT: Yeah Sunday night I had a little fever.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But it was not too bad.
DOCTOR: Is it getting better or worse?
PATIENT: It's getting to be a little better.
DOCTOR: Starting to get better alright.  It's probably like a virus.
PATIENT: Yeah my son, my son had it.  Right then and there I said I picked that cold from you dude.
DOCTOR: (Laughter) Any sore throat or anything like that?
PATIENT: It was sore for about a day or so.
DOCTOR: Now that's gone?  Any cough?
PATIENT: Not really coughing.  Sneezing and a lot of runny nose, man.
DOCTOR: I think it sounds like you're on the mend from that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Hopefully you've turned the corner.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Sometimes these things can stick around for a week or two.  But you said it sounds like you're getting better.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh let's see, how are you doing otherwise.  Any chest pain, shortness of breath anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh not really chest pain.  A little, I mean not shortness of breath, I got a little chest pain but I think that comes from being congested, runny nose.
DOCTOR: Yeah when did you have those chest pains?
PATIENT: The last couple days.
DOCTOR: Last couple days.
PATIENT: Yeah but you know.
DOCTOR: Okay do you think that anything, tell me a little more about that.
PATIENT: Hmm.  I think it's, I don't know it's just like uncomfortable.  Like I lay on this side then if I lay on the other side its better.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It could be maybe, I don't know maybe from the cold, I don't know.
DOCTOR: If you're walking around do you get the chest pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When it comes on does it seem like a discomfort?  Is it like a pressing sensation?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Or a burning pain?
PATIENT: Like a burning pain then it goes away.
DOCTOR: How long will it last for?
PATIENT: A split second and then I may not have it no more for about two, three hours you know.
DOCTOR: And you said a split second.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh and so it won't last more than that?  It just goes off on its own.  Do you have to rest when that happens?
PATIENT: No it just, you know it's uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Just kind of comes on.  Is it anything like when you had your heart attack?
PATIENT: No, that's the, you know my wife and I talked about it.  I said if it is I'll let you know you know.
DOCTOR: Any dizziness when you get that pain?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Any nausea when you get this pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Does it feel like the heart's racing at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Did you have any of those when you had your heart attack?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know I'd say I'm familiar with the symptoms.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I know.  If it get to that point you know I could.
DOCTOR: Yeah we got to keep an eye on it okay.
PATIENT: You know say something.
DOCTOR: And you don't feel like you've had to take nitroglycerin?
PATIENT: No I haven't taken it you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  When was the last time you took nitroglycerin?
PATIENT: Oh man it's been a while.
DOCTOR: It has been.
PATIENT: I just got a new bottle cause the other one was so old.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So they told me they were gonna replace it.
DOCTOR: Yeah you said you were having a fresh batch.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Then if you need it you should have it.
PATIENT: I think I got it about a month ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].  Tell me about your diabetes now.  Are you taking medications?
PATIENT: Yeah but it seems like its still running high.
DOCTOR: The last time we saw you, that was in October.  At that time the reason your sugars were running high is you weren't taking the medication.  So we said let's take your medications and see what that does.  Uh it looks like their still running high.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I takes it and still ain't right.  120 sometime and 130, 140, 160 even and I don't know what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: That's in the morning?
PATIENT: It was bad today cause I didn't take it this morning.  I didn't eat anything cause I didn't have a appetite really.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And you know she said well you should eat something and I said no I'm okay but then when she took it out there it was 168 and I couldn't understand it.
DOCTOR: And that's without having anything to eat.
PATIENT: I didn't eat anything.
DOCTOR: And the other thing is you got that lab recently, a couple days ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, I said I would make sure I come in here so we can get that done before.
DOCTOR: And that one tells us that it's been out of control for a long time now, like for three months, probably since I saw you.  Cause that's what it's saying with the Glargine.
PATIENT: Than what, I wanted to make sure I get that before I come back in here.
DOCTOR: So let's see.
PATIENT: So I came in Monday.
DOCTOR: So that's what brings up the next question, is what do we do at this point.  There's two options okay.  There's a third medication we can add on that I have to see if the VA has but sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't and the other one is insulin, we might have to start at some point with that.  Cause with your heart history, it will be very important for us to get our diabetes under control.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh what do you think.
DOCTOR: Which one do I think?
PATIENT: I don't want [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'll talk to DOCTOR you don't want.
PATIENT: No I don't want.  I mean let's see, let's try it a month.  You know and I take strict control of it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I will take, you know I take my medication; I make sure I take it on time and let's see what happens.  One month and then we go from there.
DOCTOR: You want uh.
PATIENT: Just give it a little time and see if it works and.
DOCTOR: But you said you've been taking your medications regularly.
PATIENT: I been taking it you know.
DOCTOR: So that be a good reflection of where we are.  Let me talk to, I actually don't see it on the list here.  Let me see if the VA offers it, this third medication.
PATIENT: What is it?
DOCTOR: Uh it's Actos, pioglitazone um but I mean I'll talk to him and we'll come up with a plan.
PATIENT: And then see even if I have, you know sometime like I have to take the metformin twice a day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: A lot of time, I do forget at night but I make sure I take it every day.
DOCTOR: You do take it every day.
PATIENT: Every morning I takes it.  Well a couple times at night I forget before I go to bed.
DOCTOR: So that's not every day.
PATIENT: That's not every day.  I don't forget every day but I do forget at times.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But the one in the morning I been taking every day.
DOCTOR: And I'm looking at your weight, your weight let's see, it’s been going up, actually. So that's something else we can work on, try to get you to lose some weight okay.  Um you probably have your boots on and stuff like that.
PATIENT: Boots, heavy coat but you know I realize you know it's still too much level but I seen 250 up there and yes that's too much.
DOCTOR: And exercise is gonna help control your diabetes also okay.  So I'll probably take the problems with your heart disease [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah maybe like before you know it got cool it was kind of, the weight was, I don't know I was fishing and moving around.
DOCTOR: You were doing a lot.
PATIENT: And I was doing more things than I'm doing now you know.
DOCTOR: Alright.  And your breathing is okay otherwise.
PATIENT: No I'm fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look and see everything.
PATIENT: And I'm like a conjested like I say.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: My shirt off?
DOCTOR: Yeah please.  Let me see if we checked your cholesterol.
PATIENT: The blood pressure's been fine.
DOCTOR: The blood pressure today was gppd.
PATIENT: It's been hanging in there real fine but I can't understand with the sugar.
DOCTOR: Give me a second.  How is, what's your diet?
PATIENT: Uh my wife have me eating like a pigeon sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So she's taking control of that?
PATIENT: Yeah man, vegetables I mean you know.  She say I still don't eat as much as I should but you know.
DOCTOR: So she does that.
PATIENT: Yeah man.
DOCTOR: She's watching out for you huh.
PATIENT: Sometimes I too much.
DOCTOR: (Laughter)  That's a good thing for you.
PATIENT: Yeah she been making those juices and shakes and all kinds of things.
DOCTOR: Can you tell me how often do you get this chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm a couple times a day.
DOCTOR: Couple times a day.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's for how long, how many months?
PATIENT: Not months.  It's like the last few days or something.  I thought maybe, I figured maybe I was congested or something.  I really don't know.  But like I said it wasn't to the point you know where I was really, really concerned about it.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But it was there.
DOCTOR: It was there.  Okay.  Any belly pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Blood in the urine, you going to the bathroom okay?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Urinating okay though?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Any swelling?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Let's see I'll be right back in a second.
PATIENT: Okay.  You gonna see about that medication and what we gonna do about that.
DOCTOR: What’s that.
PATIENT: Going to see about the sugar?
DOCTOR: Yeah that's what I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR about.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We'll come up with a plan for you okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And you know part of it does, we may recommend insulin based on.
PATIENT: May recommend.
DOCTOR: We might okay and if that's the case then we'll have someone teach you more about that.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But I'm going to talk to her.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  40:46  DOCTOR IN:  48:27)
DOCTOR: Alright.  Let's see.  So we talked about it and um a couple things came up.  So we were looking at your medications.  We do think insulin and we were gonna add one more thing than [REDACTED].
PATIENT: OKay.
DOCTOR: Um you know with your heart history I guess that it's absolutely [REDACTED] to get your diabetes under control cause otherwise we're just putting you at risk of having another heart attack.  Cause those stents that you have um, because they keep the vessels open but they're also at risk of closing up if we don't control your other illnesses.   Does that make sense?  Um because I was looking through here and some of these medications haven't been filled since September it says.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I been taking them, that's the old ones.  I was just trying to get them all out the way [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: Now they just about used up.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that's what I wanted to do instead of because that's a waste of med, you know that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So I believe you I mean [REDACTED] you told me the truth last time.
PATIENT: I had a few bottles of each one of those things and I just started taking them instead of, I don't like to throw away stuff like that.
DOCTOR: No problem.  So would be okay then, I think we should start the insulin.
PATIENT: Now how would I take it?
DOCTOR: So someone would teach you how to do it.  Usually what it is, you go underneath the skin.  They'll put you, you have to get a small injection um but it's not going to be too much different than what you're doing already when you check your sugars right.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So you break the skin and then it's just going to be under the skin and you give yourself an injection.
PATIENT: And how much would I have to take?
DOCTOR: So we're gonna start with 10 units okay and what we're going to have you do is come in three weeks.  Just check it every day, continue to do what you're doing, check it every day and uh keep an eye on what kind of affect it's having on your sugars cause if it's dropping too low then we may have to back off okay.  We're gonna start on uh.
PATIENT: And how often do you want me to take the sugar each day then?
DOCTOR: Once a day, still do it once a day.
PATIENT: Once a day.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And when do I take the insulin?  In the morning or?
DOCTOR: So usually they do it at night but there's no particular reason for that.  It sounds like for you, you remember your meds mostly in the mornings.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So let's do it in the morning.  Does that sound fair?
PATIENT: I'd take one shot in the morning and that's it.
DOCTOR: Yeah and that's it.
PATIENT: Then would I check the sugar at night or?
DOCTOR: Check it before to make sure it's gonna be.  This insulin that we're gonna start you off on is going to be one that lasts for 24 hours okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh you may have been in the hospital before where they have to give you a shot every six hours or so, that's not the same insulin that we're going to be using.  So you have to check it in the morning before you give it to make sure your sugar is not too low to get the insulin.
PATIENT: What should the sugar be?  Like at least before I'd take it?
DOCTOR: So if it's below 90.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't take it.
PATIENT: Take it.  If it below 90 don't take it.
DOCTOR: Don't take it and then.
PATIENT: Continue the other medications?
DOCTOR: Continue all the other medications.  So that's what we, what I want to do is see how you do down the line or maybe start taking you off the other meds.  If you start taking the insulin and it works and we'll maybe take off the glyburide.
PATIENT: Well I mean what about taking off the insulin if it's working?
DOCTOR: Well that's uh.
PATIENT: In three weeks, if we got it under control with adding the insulin.
DOCTOR: Well that means, that's something you need every day to try and keep you under control.  See how that works?  Okay.  Now if you start losing weight and that sort of thing and your sugars improve with that, we may be able to back off of the insulin by the end of the road.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I know you're worried about it and I know it's hard to accept it but sometimes when you have to give yourself an injection and that sort of thing but really the most important thing is gonna be your heart and that's what we're trying to look after.  Does that make sense?  Cause you've already proven to yourself the fact that your vessels are tenuous there they're going to be affected by the cholesterol and the [REDACTED].  Now the cholesterol it seems like we've gotten back under control now we'll take care of the diabetes.  Your blood pressure is doing better so that's the one last thing [REDACTED] next ine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And then the.
PATIENT: I know how to use the insulin.
DOCTOR: You do?
PATIENT: Yeah.  What do I get, they gonna give me the injections you know everything I need I can pick them up from the Pharmacy or they gonna mail them?
DOCTOR: Uh why don't we have you pick it up so that someone can show you exactly how to use it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And pick up the rest of the medication or you gonna mail that?
DOCTOR: Uh it's up to you; I'll put the orders in for them.  Now the albuterol I noticed you do have refills on them.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: 11 refills on that and you take your Plavix every night?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you have to have all your medications enough to last you through June.
PATIENT: Is it okay to take the Levitra with insulin?
DOCTOR: Yeah so the Levitra it's actually okay to take with insulin uh but the concern and the reason they've actually taken it off your list is uh because of the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I know not to mix the two.
DOCTOR: Okay, [REDACTED].  But yeah I think we had that discussion the last time you came in.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I thought it was okay but actually they oversaw that.  I thought it would okay because we had that discussion.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But they uh, the VA oh the bosses of the VA still [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So actually, I had ordered it and they...  So if you have some that you want to use then just make sure you don't, I mean if you're having any chest pains or anything then don't use it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Now the chest pain, like you said it doesn't sound like it's from your heart, it sounds like something else.  Give me just a sec, do you feel that at all when I press there?
PATIENT: I don't get no pain.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  But the fact that it's only less than a second.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound like [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If there is at any point that changes then don't wait till your next appointment, come in right away.
PATIENT: Alright.  I just decided it wasn't really severe so I got to go Wednesday anyway to go back to the Emergency Room so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I think that's fair.  I think at this point but if like if it starts lasting more than a minute, couple minutes.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Then you have to come in okay.  Alright.  And then the other thing when we start insulin you have to make sure, the same with your other [REDACTED] is a consistent diet.  You're having the same number of meals every day that kind of thing.
PATIENT: Same number of meals.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Well you know that's something I kind of got to get in the habit of doing that because see like today I just didn't have no appetite, I didn't eat.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah just so, cause we also want you to, so we want you to avoid getting high but we also want you avoid getting too low okay.  That's not a been a problem [REDACTED].  Alright.  You're all set okay.  So I'm gonna have you come back for two things in three weeks just to see how your sugars are doing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you can, at that time, also bring the log if you can try to record what you were getting at home.
PATIENT: Fasting readings, I can set this meter.
DOCTOR: Set the meter okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Then bring that with you then.
PATIENT: I got plenty of scripts though.
DOCTOR: You did.
PATIENT: I mean they there, I mean I can pick them up?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's what.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  No but I want you to bring in the readings so we can see what you’re getting at home.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we'll have you just come back and see me in 2-3 months.
PATIENT: Okay three weeks.
DOCTOR: Stop up here and they'll check your sugar and then we can make any adjustment [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay so when I leave they give me an appointment in three weeks to come back.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Check in at the desk.
DOCTOR: Right.  Okay.
PATIENT: Cause see last time they say they gonna mail me one and I never seen nothing in the mail.
DOCTOR: Oh is that right.  No, no so this one they'll give it to you then.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Meet with the pharmacist.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright take care.
PATIENT: Okay you too man, will do.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Make sure you're not out in the cold too much.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Cause it's that's also has an affect on the heart and you don't shovel right?
PATIENT: No uh uh I got a big old son for that.
DOCTOR: Alright good.
PATIENT: He do that.
DOCTOR: One you're outside take care of yourself.
PATIENT: I don't be out there long with the parking [REDACTED].  Okay thanks doc.
DOCTOR: Thank you, take care.
PATIENT: 61:04.
