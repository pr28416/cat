DOCTOR: In November, the end of November that I saw you the last time um and then when did you restart?
PATIENT: I started about a month ago.
DOCTOR: Okay so you had some time where you were able to avoid it um.
PATIENT: But um the program I was in was a good program cause you know it showed [REDACTED] you know it was like bad shape [REDACTED].  I feel better that I did you know did a program and um it was a good program and I was just, you know boredom or whatever I you know I slipped in there but I have [REDACTED] changed [REDACTED] after the program.  So instead of every day it's like once or twice a week you know.  That's still not good but it's slowly down over 75%.
DOCTOR: That's good and I think and actually to get you off of it again and keep you off of it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So hopefully working with them again will hopefully get you there um.
PATIENT: Laughing to myself, you know, the me, myself and I. The eyes don't lie you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It was the eyes.  Uh really because you're a doctor though, come on man.
DOCTOR: Uh you know uh we want what's best for you.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And to do that we need to know the truth and even if you say, even if you don't do what we tell you, we want to know about it.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Make sure that we can do everything we can.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Your care so.  We uh, we're not here to pass any judgment.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: We'll just give you advice.  That's what we do.  We'll give you advice and if you take it that's great.
PATIENT: I appreciate the whole VA System and everything like that but um I mean the friends of mine, they don't have, they don't have the options that I have.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So.  Um I've been [REDACTED] since 86 and actually this is the first time I've been using it, the program.  I had a tooth pulled back in '91 but aside that I don't know, I [REDACTED].  I wish I knew more about it then.
DOCTOR: Uh let's see.  So it looks like uh you never got the colonoscopy, it looks like.
PATIENT: No sir.
DOCTOR: Um is that something you wanted to do now or do you want to hold off for now?
PATIENT: I'd be willing to do that.
DOCTOR: Alright we'll put it back in.
PATIENT: Is that recommended or?
DOCTOR: Yeah so the reason we do it is because um, once you get above 50 your risk of colon cancer is increased and uh this is the way we can see it early, treat it.  Sometimes it's something small, which usually it is, if we see you regularly they can just take it out and then that'll be the end of it.  Um whereas if it becomes something that we miss um you know maybe you'd be able to go for you know maybe you wouldn't get it during your lifetime and wouldn't have any problems but it you would then it would become advanced and then that causes more problems and it's been shown to be effective in taking care of it early on.  Uh can I take a look at your feet?  Take your shoes and socks off.  Set things up.
PATIENT: I've got the pain right here.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Where is the pain mostly in the morning?
PATIENT: On most of the morning, it's right here.
DOCTOR: Oh through there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um I'm going to poke you with this, see if you can feel it.
PATIENT: I feel like a tapping.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yes sir.
DOCTOR: Feel that?
PATIENT: Yes sir.  Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Feel it there?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And there?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: Get that pain now?
PATIENT: Yes, oh yes.
DOCTOR: Okay it looks like, any pain in here?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It looks like your pain is right over where you've got another one of those calluses.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um so we'll probably just continue with you seeing them and taking care of that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I know they're growing back pretty quick but um.
PATIENT: You [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh just keep, the only way to.
PATIENT: Yeah right here.
