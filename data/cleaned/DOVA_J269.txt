DOCTOR: Okay.  Alrighty.  Okay so, you're seeing the eye doctor today, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Which eye is it that's painful?
PATIENT: The left.
DOCTOR: They said you got an infection in there huh?
PATIENT: No, shingles.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's like a viral infection.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay uh.  How long has it been like that for?
PATIENT: Saturday.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Anybody around you been sick or anything else like that?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Any sick contacts, anybody around you has been sick or?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Maybe it's just the shingles reactivation.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Ever had shingles anywhere else before?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh any problems with vision in that eye?
PATIENT: Well no I can still see with it but it's painful.
DOCTOR: Very painful.  Does the light make it more painful?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Does the light hurt it?
PATIENT: Not really.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Anything else bothering you besides this?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: How's your breathing?
PATIENT: Okay I guess.
DOCTOR: Any coughing, fevers, chills?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Um any worsening in leg swelling or weight gain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Alright.  No chest pains recently.
PATIENT: Not really.
DOCTOR: Uh are living back to your son's again?
PATIENT: No I'm on my own now.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Where do you live?
PATIENT: In my own home.
DOCTOR: In Arlington Heights, is that where you're still living?
PATIENT: Arlington Heights.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay so.
PATIENT: What kind of pain medicine would you use for the shingles?
DOCTOR: Uh the same pain medication used for anything else really.  There's nothing specific for that.  You think you need pain medicine?
PATIENT: I don’t know, which ones can you give?
DOCTOR: Have you tried anything?
PATIENT: Yeah Tylenol but I've been [REDACTED] all the time, all day yesterday, here in the hospital today I spent a long time.
DOCTOR: So your weight is up from where we last had it.  Last month.  It went from 188 to 195.
PATIENT: Hmm well I'm fluctuating around the 190 mark.
DOCTOR: You watching your diet with the salt and everything.
PATIENT: Oh sure.
DOCTOR: Okay and the fluids?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Any diarrhea coming back?
PATIENT: Uh, well it has nothing to do with C-Diff.  It's just regular diarrhea.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yesterday and that's flared up but I, what is the stuff they use for diarrhea when they have it, what's the medicine?  It's over-the-counter I think.
DOCTOR: Oh loperamide is the generic name but it's called, it's normally called Lomotil.  I think it was a brand name that you buy, Imodium, is that what you're talking about?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.
DOCTOR: It’s dangerous to use if you're worried about C. diff.
PATIENT: What.
DOCTOR: That Imodium.
PATIENT: Oh.  I had C. diff four times this year.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know.  I would not recommend that medicine for you.
PATIENT: I wouldn't take it then.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Because what happens is, you get the toxins out, they build up and especially with the C. diff you have a very large increase in your colon where it gets bigger in size and they could explode and that's it perferates on that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Well how's your activity levels?
PATIENT: Oh I try to move but I can barely move around I mean, I just sit.  I waddle like a duck when I'm off the scooter.
DOCTOR: You finished cardiac rehab after your bypass right, a year ago?
PATIENT: Cardiac, what do you mean cardiac?
DOCTOR: You had rehab after your bypass?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: And then you were at the nursing home where you were getting rehab.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah and I spent Tuesdays in PCC1B.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And Wednesday on the 15th floor and also a short stay, I don't know what floor it was, for just a few days and that was reacting to diarrhea and at the time, then the C. diff though.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um you're not getting any therapy right now?
PATIENT: I had a therapist coming in and uh I don't know what her name is, she used to come over to my son's house and I moved out of his house last week and I had a nurse, a real Polish nurse, a nice one, NURSE something or other.  I don't have her phone number, but my kids' got all the phone numbers and I wanted to contact both of them.
DOCTOR: Was that through the VA or who?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know who they are.
DOCTOR: Think it's somebody in therapy?
PATIENT: Well, yes sure.
DOCTOR: I don't think so uh, okay.
PATIENT: How do I get hold of the therapist and the one that's been seeing me?
DOCTOR: I don't know about the one that's seeing you.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um I can put an order in to get a therapist.  You can always try calling your son and have your son call them and you now we need an order and I'll put an order for therapy.
PATIENT: Okay but what about the nurse?  She's been checking my vitals.
DOCTOR: Yeah a home nurse.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I'll be concerned about seeing her; she's a very good nurse.  She was coming in Friday to see me and then last Friday I missed her.  The therapist was coming in on Saturday and I missed her.
DOCTOR: You there's a program here called Home-Based Primary Care.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And what it means is a doctor comes out to visit you at your house every so often instead of you coming here to Hines um and also nurses come out and visit you every so often.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um, they basically become your primary care doctor but I'm wondering since you really are liking the fact that these people are coming to your house and checking up on you and that type of thing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Is this something you would be interested in?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me talk to people and see what it takes to get you in the program there.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Cause it almost sounds like, you know, it's the type of thing, you [REDACTED] so much success with this, sounds like they keep a close eye on you at home and uh and it may help that way.  Okay, do you need your meds refilled I assume?
PATIENT: Yeah.  They'll have them going down to the Pharmacy but I won't be able to get all that filled today unless you have some other medication for me.  That you can have mailed to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, yeah we'll mail those up to you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me take a listen to you.  Just stay right there.  [REDACTED] alright.  Big breath in now.
PATIENT: There's a crackling in the right lung I guess uh, I think its scar tissue and uh uh, I had four CAT scans plus a CT scan.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it wasn't getting any worse.  The first one was seen and then the three after that were not getting worse so they weren't concerned about that.  But the scar tissue was there.
DOCTOR: From a former pneumonia?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you've seen a pulmonologist it looks like.  They want you to get another x-ray of your chest is that right?
PATIENT: When?
DOCTOR: This month or next month.
PATIENT: Will they send me an appointment?
DOCTOR: Uh we can get one set-up.
PATIENT: Well about, you know last year I asked you, this is last year, I asked you about my triglycerides.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They were high.  I don't think you were concerned about that because uh nothing was done but boom, in November I had to have open heart surgery and quadruple bypass.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So are you concerned it was the triglyceride that did that?
PATIENT: I don't know, I can say that.
DOCTOR: Uh, it probably wasn't.  Um, you have diabetes right.
PATIENT: How can you check the diabetes?
DOCTOR: Oh there's ways to do these. It looks like it’s really well controlled, really.  Um triglycerides are not even really, they are a very minor risk factor for heart disease.
PATIENT: Well it was 300 all that time; it said 300, 300, 300.
DOCTOR: 180 is the last one we have done here.
PATIENT: I did when was that?
DOCTOR: That was back this past summer in June.  Prior to that.
PATIENT: Well that's when I was hospitalized in 1B.
DOCTOR: Prior to that it was 192 and that was back in February.
PATIENT: And prior to that it was 300.  Cause it was controlled back then I guess.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: With the diet and everything.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And this was before.
DOCTOR: And your other cholesterol panel was fine, so I think that, you know um, taking all that together, you don't want to go aggressively and you are on a couple of medications for that.
PATIENT: Really.
DOCTOR: Uh, [REDACTED] and all that stuff okay.  Yeah I don't know if I'll change that.  I want to recheck the cholesterol panel the next visit.
PATIENT: Oh Zocor, they put me on a half and you had me on the full tablet.
DOCTOR: Who switched it?
PATIENT: I don't know.  Listen when I got out of the 15th floor in the main building.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: There was uh a nurse over there that screwed up on six of my medications and I called DOCTOR and DOCTOR called her and boy she really moved and she called my son at the time when I was staying with him and she apologized for those goof ups.  There were medical increases that the doctors gave me while I was in the hospital there and there were, I don't know what changes they were but anyway it amounted to six of them and that wasn't too good for a nurse practitioner.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Let's um, let's recheck your cholesterol and see how it's been on the dose that you've been taking.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we can make changes based on that.
PATIENT: As long as I'm staying with the 5 mg.
DOCTOR: You're taking 10; you're taking half of a 20.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I've been taking a whole one.
DOCTOR: You have?
PATIENT: Cause I remember, I remember I was on a whole one before and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Was it a different dose though?
PATIENT: See I didn't see?
DOCTOR: It [REDACTED] dose, if you're on 20, so I'll give you a 40 and tell you to split in half.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you're on 10, they'll give you a 20 and tell you to split in half so.
PATIENT: No I'll check it and see if it's 20 or 40.
DOCTOR: If it says that you're getting 20, you should be splitting it so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um, okay.  Give me a minute and I'll be right back.  We'll get some of this, I'll get some of the meds refilled and we'll get some of this, we'll help you get some PT.
PATIENT: Nothing’s different except for this except Tylenol.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  The pain um, there is other things um.  Anti-inflammatories I don't think you'd be a good guy to take those.
PATIENT: You know my nerves are acting up in my foot cause I had that broken heel and foot.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh the nerves and what the hell, oh my teeth bother me like hell.  I mean I don't know I can't get into the dentist unless I have a high diabetic count.
DOCTOR: Yeah you can't get into the dentist here.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I did once, one had a blood count.  You can't do it but the blood would say it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You have to be shaken up to really warrant it and I don't think.
PATIENT: They had me in there once.  This diabetes has been fluctuating on and off, on and off.
DOCTOR: So, it's not a bad enough now problem, that's the problem.  This is my concern with giving you a bunch of pain medications.  You're on a lot of medications.
PATIENT: You'd better believe it.
DOCTOR: And you know a lot of it can cause drowsiness and other things and the pain medication would worsen all of those and especially the risk of falling, uh given all these other medications.
PATIENT: I want to get up and go walk around again.  I can barely walk.  I walk like a duck you know.  It's just a few inches at a time.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I mean I don't want you to fall and break your hip or hit your head or something.
PATIENT: Ah, so you break your hip you know.
DOCTOR: Uh hip breaks are fatal in 50% of people your age.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, well how many?
DOCTOR: 50%.
PATIENT: Well 50% do alright.
DOCTOR: I don't think it would be in good conscious I could do something like that. Um, you know I want to give you some pain medicine but I think we need to think very carefully about.
PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: About what we can give you.
PATIENT: Well so I can pick it up tonight in the Pharmacy?
DOCTOR: I don’t know what else I can give you other than Tylenol at this point.
PATIENT: Well I've been taking Tylenol, that's a short running thing.
DOCTOR: When is the pain the worse, is it all day?
PATIENT: All day, all night.  I had a bad night.  I couldn't sleep at all last night.  Uh on and off, on and off, on and off, I don't know how many times, 20, 30, 40 times.  That's not sleeping.
DOCTOR: Where is it the worst, if you point one finger?
PATIENT: By here.
DOCTOR: Is it just in one certain place?
PATIENT: It's right in the eye.
DOCTOR: Yeah is it the entire eye, is it like a certain lid?
PATIENT: No it's in the left, see when I blink I feel it, I can't touch my eyelid.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me see; let me see what we have here that um.
PATIENT: Yeah please.
DOCTOR: That I think might be safe for you okay.
PATIENT: Please.
DOCTOR: Alright give me one second.
(DOCTOR OUT:  59:20  DOCTOR IN:  64:14)
DOCTOR: Alright so.  I was looking at; you were on Vicodin in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah I don't care for that Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Have you had Tylenol 3?
PATIENT: No, could Tylenol number 3, maybe I ought to try that.
DOCTOR: What was the issue with Vicodin?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: What was your issue with Vicodin?
PATIENT: None.
DOCTOR: Did it work or?
PATIENT: Yeah it worked.  I was getting it three times a day in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you want to try some of that or no?
PATIENT: Yeah, you better set me up with the Vicodin then.
DOCTOR: Okay we'll try that.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] the dosage.
DOCTOR: I don't know um.  This Vicodin has Tylenol in it so don't take any Tylenol on top of it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
