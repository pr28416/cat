I thought that I was just getting a cold. But now that it's happened like three times, I'm thinking maybe you have some sort of an allergy like maybe,  I don't know. Maybe it's like yeah, I'm just allergic to something. Maybe his plants or something. I don't know.
DOCTOR: OK, and it does this happen each time that you go go to his house?

PATIENT: No, I've just been visiting him and I just go grocery shopping. I've just I've been doing schooling online. Yeah, I don't think so. I'm usually very careful, I'm not. Yeah, I'm not maintaining social distancing with my boyfriend. He's in my social circle, but yeah, other than that no one I think yeah.
DOCTOR: Ok. And have you traveled anywhere?

DOCTOR: OK. And so I wanted to ask about the boyfriend's house as well. Is there any pets in the home there?
PATIENT: Oh yeah. Yeah, he has this cute little parrot. And he also has a cat.
DOCTOR: OK, and do you have any pets at your house?
PATIENT: No, no I don't.
DOCTOR: Oh, OK. So that I think that was everything that I wanted to ask on on history today, was there anything else I forgot to mention or you wanted to to bring up?
PATIENT: I don't think so, no.
DOCTOR: OK, so it sounds like there's potentially could be caused by an allergen such as which could be   from an animal like a parrot or a cat that is causing just a reaction and it's bringing these symptoms on like called hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but also we can't rule out asthma as well as being a trigger of kind of the cough and shortness of breath is being around allergens as well, so we'll order pulmonary function test, and maybe some, uh, uh, imaging and chest x-ray and we will go from there.
PATIENT: Great, thank you.
