PATIENT: No, I can't do that. It's yeah, it's too painful.
DOCTOR: I see, alright, so those are all the questions I had for you so it seems. It's great, it's good that you came to the emergency Department. Do you have any questions at all?
PATIENT: No, just like how can I fix this?
DOCTOR: Yeah, so based on your symptoms, it's something that's pretty urgent. It's seems like you may be having something called cauda Equina syndrome that may be caused by your back pain and that's why you're feeling that groin would be called saddle anesthesia and then the urinary incontinence. So this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident. And it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms. So the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing going on like for example, like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be. We may be worried about just to make sure. Well, just to see what's going on in there that's causing these symptoms. And then based on what we find, uh, we will, we will target like the cause of the symptoms, like for example if it's an infect infection that's causing this, you might need to be admitted and require antibiotics. If there is any masses causing it, you may require surgery. For example if it's mainly related to your back it is something that we will have to treat with with an admission so it's good that you came in here today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, that was it. Thank you so much for your help.
DOCTOR: You're welcome and will get back to you shortly.
