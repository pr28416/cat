DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh they were going to throw me out of the program.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They put me in the nut ward on 7 for seven days and let me back in the program.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And you stopped the drinking, I mean how do you feel about the program are you committed since then?
PATIENT: Yeah I'm trying to, I mean I don't think the, I think the program's flawed because they had four field trips just in the first 21 days I was there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: In the first 21 days, four field trips – for an inpatient, to me that didn't seem like a normal inpatient program.
DOCTOR: I'm not sure [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay but from what I understand most programs, at least 21 days before you can see the outside world but anyway um I am committed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I was standing in line for five hours with a bunch of homeless drunks and so on with bottles in their pockets and that's pretty tempting you know.
DOCTOR: I know that's tempting.
PATIENT: I'm not justifying it but.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: I did it.
DOCTOR: You did it.
PATIENT: And I spent seven days on the nut ward for it.

PATIENT: Well I.
DOCTOR: They also have an addictive potential.
PATIENT: Oh I know that.
DOCTOR: That's why I don't want to give you medication for that right now.
PATIENT: Alright.  I've had insomnia my entire life.  That's a lot of the reason why I drank so much.

PATIENT: Oh I should get a number first and.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah you should get a number.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You're good to go.
