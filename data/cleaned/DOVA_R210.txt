Just to make sure.  I do want to talk to them and see if there are any other options okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Cause I know they want you on the boot but it's so hard to put on like you say I want to see if they have another solutions.
PATIENT: Yeah well the boot, I can't put it on by myself.
DOCTOR: Exactly, exactly so you know if you're not gonna do that what are the other options okay.  Other than giving you the right kind of padding in your shoes. Let’s see what else they have.  Did they say if there was anything else when you saw them at that time?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Cause I think you told them that you couldn't put it on the boot, right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Right okay.
PATIENT: I don’t know what they were thinking about when they made those boots.
DOCTOR: Yeah right.  It should be something that makes it easier for you to put on and what not.  Let me take a listen to you.  Any cough or fevers, nothing like that right?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Nice deep breath for me, in and out.  Good.  Breathe normal.  [REDACTED].  The swelling is a little better than the last time when I saw you.

DOCTOR: Is not enough to last.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay and you were taking how many units before?  You're taking 6 or 7?
PATIENT: 7.
DOCTOR: 7 okay.  I'll change that okay and then it looks like you're running low on the long-acting too right?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And you’re on the 60 units right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: With everything else, you still have some refills but I'll update those.  Did you [REDACTED].  So your blood pressure looks good, we'll keep you on everything else going to be the same.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: The only thing is I think you are due for lab work, some blood testing, today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So a couple things we're gonna be checking um we'll have, did you get the vitamin D before?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Um we need to kind of make sure the levels goes back up to where they should be okay.

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  [REDACTED] order  [REDACTED].  That's okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you want to pick them up today or do you want them mailed to you?
PATIENT: They can be mailed.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So the insulin, it does say 7 units before breakfast, lunch and dinner but you have to take it as before you eat okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Cause I know you normally eat two meals a day [REDACTED] you don’t eat as much [REDACTED] keep that two.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So do it like that okay.  I'll just change it here.  So everything is going to be mailed to you.  Good.  Well [REDACTED] I’ll be back in a flash, okay.  You got your flu shots this year?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Both of them?
PATIENT: Probably just one.
DOCTOR: The [REDACTED] one?  With uh, everybody under 65, which you aren’t, um we recommend it getting because of your diabetes and stuff, you'd be at a high risk, you know if you do get it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: They give me the swine flu.
DOCTOR: Yeah they'll give you the swine flu shot too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so reactions, people’s allergic reactions, the same as [REDACTED] have the flu shot [REDACTED] so the only reason [REDACTED] allergic to eggs or something like that.  If you're able to [REDACTED] I don't expect you’ll have any reactions [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Give me one second I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
(DOCTOR OUT:  50:02  DOCTOR IN:  53:24)
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let's look at [REDACTED] what other options there are if it's not the boot.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: They said sometimes it can have like with a cast or something similar to that, where it would keep the weight off the foot and the ulcer [REDACTED] because we don't want it turning into something else okay.  And the problem with having that kind of you know ulcer on the foot problems down here [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] worry about the healing and the situation and things like that and um you know diabetes makes it a bit hard for heal wounds and things like that in the feet and the fingers and so um what I'd like to do is we’ll get you an appointment back in the foot clinic and we'll see what else they can do for you okay.  Cause we've got to keep the weight off.  I don't want it turning into this big fat ugly thing that, you know that requires potentially cutting it off and getting rid of it, we don’t want that, okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright so we'll send you back to them and I'll see you again in three weeks okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: They can actually make that appointment out front.  And I just want to make sure that this is the correct number to reach you at NUMBER?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um if there’s an answering  machine or something like that.  [REDACTED] get the lab if you wanted [REDACTED] or we need to make adjustments to anything I'll give you a call; otherwise you know it will take about a week for everything to come back, if you don't hear from me then everything is good.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Then let's do this.  All your meds are in and order the lab and that's it unless you have any other questions.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Oh.  And [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You want me to come in for the uh.
