DOCTOR: Patient?  We'll go this way.  How you doing today?

PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good, good.  So you [REDACTED].  Would you like to sit here?
PATIENT: That's okay.
DOCTOR: There's a chair.  You're welcome to.
PATIENT: That's alright.
DOCTOR: Oh you're doing a [REDACTED], is it new?
PATIENT: It could be [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  But one muscle twitch or does it happen, oh it's [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah anyway.  [REDACTED].  Really that's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Is there any pain or tingling with that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: There is.  So have you seen a neurologist?  About it, no.  Probably just kind of a nerve issue.  Yeah.
PATIENT: You know I didn't think to just ask you, no [REDACTED] to go see a neurologist.
DOCTOR: Okay, no I know.  I [REDACTED] you’re right.  Okay otherwise things are going pretty well?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How are the blood sugars doing?
PATIENT: Good uh, I didn't take it this morning [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Are you taking it most days?
PATIENT: No I take it about three times a week.
DOCTOR: And what time do you usually take it?  In the morning?
PATIENT: About once a day, sometimes in the morning, sometimes I'll check it in the afternoon or sometimes at night.
DOCTOR: Right what are your normal values?  In the morning?
PATIENT: In the morning?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well maybe between anywhere between 145 or so and 80.
DOCTOR: Oh down to 80 okay.  Well that's pretty good.
PATIENT: Today it's in the 120s.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What about later in the day, pretty well controlled or a little higher?
PATIENT: About 150-160s.
DOCTOR: Not bad at all.
PATIENT: Yeah it's come down quite a bit.
DOCTOR: It has I remember the last time it was.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah it was 300 in my last note so that's terrific um and then blood pressures are you taking the blood pressures?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: How much are you getting for that?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What are you getting for the blood pressures sorry?
PATIENT: Right uh to control it?
DOCTOR: No I'm sorry the numbers when you take it at home.
PATIENT: Oh they just took it, it was like uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah I got your values here which was perfect.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Are you taking it at home with your own cuff?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah every now and then.
DOCTOR: And what do you normally get when you take it?
PATIENT: I think it was about two weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Let's have you take it a little more frequently, maybe let's say you take your blood pressures three times a week or so.
PATIENT: Really?
DOCTOR: Yeah see what you're running at home.  We have you on blood pressure medicine I'd like to make sure you're controlled.
PATIENT: Oh alright.
DOCTOR: It looks good but I have faith that it's probably good at home too but let's see what you're running at home.
PATIENT: I never checked it [REDACTED] take it once a month.
DOCTOR: Right okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So let's change that.
PATIENT: Yeah that'd be cool to do that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah so you have an idea you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah if you have a cuff you may as well.  Write down what you get next time when you're writing down your blood sugars.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And keep track that way.  Now how are you doing on the smoking?
PATIENT: Still smoking.
DOCTOR: One pack a day still?
PATIENT: Yeah I think it's still [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Same.
PATIENT: Yeah you know yeah.
DOCTOR: Um have you any interest in quitting, no?  Okay.  Any particular reason why not?  Can I help you a little get motivated?  A little?
PATIENT: It's really not a motivational think.  I like to [REDACTED] and I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I think [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Yeah no I mean I understand that, it's just important to know that especially with the diabetes it's um, it kind of compounds the diabetes and causes a lot of issues with the heart, the kidneys and we see a lot of things like that like amputations and infections, things like that all the time.  (Doctor takes a phone call).  I'm just going to put something in real quick.  Sorry.  How about alcohol?  How much are you drinking?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um a couple times a week?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Every day, not even, okay.  Any other drugs besides medicine?  Okay.  And still retirement [REDACTED] for this?  Is it at Bethany?  Um in terms of medication, I've got you on the citalopram once a day and the diltiazem blood pressure just the once a day.  The stool softener twice a day, not taking that.  Do you want me to take it off your list?
PATIENT: They only gave me that stuff [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh that's why so I'll take that off.  You don't want to get it?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: What medicine [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Uh gabapentin.  Do you take two pills every eight hours?  Three times a day?
PATIENT: Yeah.  [REDACTED].  But I can't take it every eight hours.  Especially when I don't even eat breakfast.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So you want [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It seems like I have to get up in the morning you should eat [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So I take two in the morning, one at noon, one in the evening and two at bedtime.
DOCTOR: That's fine.
PATIENT: Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yeah that's fine.  Are you feeling okay from the diabetic pain, with the burning pain?
PATIENT: No, not really.
DOCTOR: It's not helping at all?
PATIENT: No, never has, it never has.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What if we increase your dose then?  We have the room.
PATIENT: I’ve been taking this stuff [REDACTED] six years ago.
DOCTOR: Well if it's not helping there's no point in keeping it up.  We can either increase the dose or we can taper you off I mean.  If you want to keep trying it, if the diabetic pain is bothering you then I suggest.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] every day.  It has been for years.
DOCTOR: Yeah but that's why we might try to control it with this medication or we could try a different medication if you want.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I told my doctor to take me off it in the hospital.  [REDACTED] last four or five years you know.
DOCTOR: Is it bothering you a lot the pain, the diabetes pain?
PATIENT: Yeah.  [REDACTED] seems like a coal-burning pain you know with pain radiating this and that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Why don't we increase your dose, do you want to try it?  Why don't we try it and tell me if it works and if so then we'll change it.  Try taking, uh try taking three in the morning, three at lunch, three at night.  You willing to do that?  What do you think?  That's a lot more regular.  The maximum dose per day which I think is quite high for uh gabapentin.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: (Doctor answers a page)  Alright, now wait I need to see, I think the maximum dose is probably, yeah it is [REDACTED] pills per day.  So you take 900, we've got you on; if this doesn't work we'll try something else.  We'll taper you off it.  Two capsules, so take three capsules so 900 mg morning and at night. Can you put it in your box that way?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let me change the order.  So if you start running out I'm putting in more refills for you right now.  And we'll give that a try and let me see where we were.  [REDACTED].  Are you still taking it twice a day for pain or not anymore?  The ibuprofen?
PATIENT: I don't take it anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay that's fine.
PATIENT: I just take it if I need it.
DOCTOR: That's absolutely fine.
PATIENT: I don't take it every day.
DOCTOR: That's actually even better.  Um and then your thyroid medication you take one per day.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then the lisinopril one per day.  Do you have a multivitamin?  Um omeprazole.
PATIENT: Omeprazole what's that for?
DOCTOR: For the GERD for the acid reflux.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you take it once a day in the morning?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I take two of them every morning.
DOCTOR: That's perfect and the pravastatin 1/2 per day for cholesterol at bedtime?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Taking that one still.  Trazodone for sleeping okay and then I have you on some triamcinolone ointment.  Oh we gave you that you had a rash right, has it helped a little bit?
PATIENT: No not really.
DOCTOR: No.  You gonna be seeing the Derm people again?
PATIENT: I don't know.  You know I changed my [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh good, maybe that was irritating your skin a little bit.  So.
PATIENT: I remember it seems like [REDACTED].  I think it's more and then it goes away.
DOCTOR: Oh that's kind of weird.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Uh how about the bupropion, two tablets a day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Are you on the bupropion okay and buspirone you take for anxiety two tablets three times a day okay.  And then the glipizide for the diabetes two tablets twice a day.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And metformin one tablet twice a day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Anything that I missed?
PATIENT: I don't think you missed [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Want another one?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] still take it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You can buy it over-the-counter but it's cheaper for you here, to get your refills here.  Then at least you can get it right here.  It's been a while since you've got that one it looks like.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Do you take a baby aspirin?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I get [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No that's good; it's a good thing to do.  It protects your heart.  It's a good remedy.  Why don't we just mail it to you is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay that's [REDACTED].  It doesn't look like you've had any blood work done in a while.  I did some blood work in January.  We did some blood work in November and everything looked pretty good actually.  Your cholesterol.  We should probably get some more blood work on you.  November, so it's been at least six months um and the cholesterol at that time was just a tad high and the diabetes value was also quite high.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: The diabetes value.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that's a measurement of your average sugars over about three months.  So that we can check how your diabetes control is.  At that time it was pretty high but I'm thinking that now you're um.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'm sorry?  The hemoglobin A1c.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's the value.
PATIENT: What was it?
DOCTOR: It was 10.5 and the goal is less than 7 but with your sugars being better controlled now, I'm gonna guess that it's probably better.  Did you eat breakfast this morning?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: You did.  Are you able to come back to the VA in the next few weeks?  Would you be, are you going to be back for something else?
PATIENT: Not until September [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah um is it difficult for you to get here?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well I'm willing to get, I'm willing to get them in September that's okay if you want to do that.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well when you come for that appointment then uh let's see, September 12th, fast and we'll check your labs, is that gonna be hard.  It's at 10 a.m.  Is that okay if you don't eat breakfast that day?  Just bring a snack for after your appointment.  So fast, you can eat dinner but then after that no more food and then we'll do cholesterol that day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll get your other tests then too.
PATIENT: Okay.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right and we'll see how your diabetes control is doing then.  We'll draw the bloodwork then okay.  I want to do an exam here.  Your blood pressure was good right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm just gonna pull you back a little bit more.  Lean forward just a tad for me.  A couple deep breaths.  Okay go ahead and lay back; I'll feel your belly.  Bowel movements have been normal for you?  Did you fall?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: You have a little cut on your head.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What was that from?
PATIENT: My comb.
DOCTOR: From what?
PATIENT: My comb.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry.
PATIENT: My comb.
DOCTOR: Oh your comb.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh gosh.  That’s a hard comb?
PATIENT: Yeah I [REDACTED].  Sometimes I forget [REDACTED].  I do it real fast you know.
DOCTOR: What is this from?
PATIENT: Because I fell.
DOCTOR: Oh you did fall there?  When did you fall?
PATIENT: About a week ago.
DOCTOR: What happened?  Was it just lost your balance or?
PATIENT: No, no I uh a friend of mine was pushing me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I was going down this bump [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Did you see anybody about that?
PATIENT: What this?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: You don't have any pain in your knee do you?
PATIENT: Yeah it's sore.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's sore, just sore.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I just want to make sure that you didn't break anything.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay alright.  Take good care of these guys.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: It looks like we got some healing but that one's still open.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Right on the front of the knee there.  Make sure you're watching that.  Um a little Neosporin too if you have some, put on there.  Neosporin or Bacitracin is fine.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's fine.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um just so we don't see an infection or anything.  Sorry.  Make sure you're cleaning out between your toes.
PATIENT: I'm getting [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Because they get linty.  Pretty good keeping the nails clipped here.  Yeah so we'll do the sensation test okay.  Close your eyes for me, do you feel this okay?  Anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Tell me when you feel it.  Anything?
PATIENT: Maybe a little.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright so not much sensation in the foot there.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Sorry.
PATIENT: Seems like if I stub my toe or something I feel it.
DOCTOR: You can feel it okay.  [REDACTED] everything look okay there?  Looks like you had a little [REDACTED] here.  [REDACTED] okay.  A little spot over there, a little scrape.
PATIENT: Yeah but that was from itching.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Okay good.  [REDACTED] did you say you wear those?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Really, why?
PATIENT: Because this leg won't straighten out.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But.  This leg won't straighten out so I wouldn't be able to walk anyway.
DOCTOR: You mean the right one doesn’t?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] wheelchair.
DOCTOR: Huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I have bad knees. I went from a cane to a walker to a wheelchair and that's how and that’s how this leg started out.  I needed it.
DOCTOR: Oh for the right knee.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'm sorry [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So um.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right okay.  So um did you end up getting your colonoscopy done?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Why, what happened?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You don't have the [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah I couldn't picture myself sitting in the bathroom all day.
DOCTOR: Did they call you and try to schedule it?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And I have to do that catheter [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] no.
PATIENT: To me, [REDACTED] in a wheelchair having jump up to go to the bathroom you most of the time it's just not easy.
DOCTOR: I know but it is only the one day.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: It's only one day and then you get it done, probably for ten years.  That's the good thing about the colonoscopy.  Every [REDACTED] ten years.  Do you want to think about it?
PATIENT: Can't do it.
DOCTOR: I'll bring it up next time you're here.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know and it's a terrible day.  I'm not gonna lie to you.  People do not like the prep because it's uncomfortable; you're in the bathroom most of the day.  Usually they’ll schedule it and sometimes they'll get 15 on a Monday because it's a Sunday and obviously you're on, get everything done, get it on a Monday and then you're done with it.  Um but then it's all finished so then it's just one day that's terrible.  So think about it.
PATIENT: It’s twice as terrible for me being in the wheelchair.
DOCTOR: Oh I know.
PATIENT: Can’t take me down in that wheelchair that quick.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So.  Did we talk about it last time about having a Living Will or a document that states what you would want to have anything?
PATIENT: I have that.
DOCTOR: You do have one okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Does somebody in your family know what your wishes are?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh we talked about the falls but it sounds like it's sort of wheelchair related.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah when you fall.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: You're not having falls because you're getting lightheaded or anything like that though?  We are recommending to everybody that they get an HIV screening test, even if you have no risk factors.  Um if you like decline it that's fine but we encourage people to just get it on record um and then if it's negative you're done unless you want it again.  So I can fill it in for your next blood work, if you don't want it that's okay too.
PATIENT: Doesn't bother me, I haven’t had sex [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You can get it through the other ways or it can be.
PATIENT: Okay go ahead and take it.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  I'll put it on with your next lab.  It's just one more thing.  And we talked about, I'll bother you about smoking again next visit I mean so don't worry I won't forget.
PATIENT: Yeah I know that.  I understand.
DOCTOR: We do have a lot of things that people can use to um to help out if they do want to quit um.  Let's see [REDACTED].  So just let me know if the thought ever crosses your mind that you may want some assistance or you may want to cut back or anything.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um so let me fill the rest of your blood work in for September 17th, okay yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So we'll check the lipids and we'll check the cholesterol.  You're following fairly regularly with the Mental Health folks right?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] before I came.
DOCTOR: And they wanted you to stay on all the same medications and they didn't make any changes this morning right?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh you did.  [REDACTED].  Okay.  I think that's all I wanted to go over.  Is there anything else you wanted to bring up today?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] refills in.
DOCTOR: The prazosin, somebody refilled it, you've got five refills now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'm just gonna [REDACTED].  Trazodone is only one, let me renew that one.  Let's see somebody else did that already.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah it looks like he refilled all those and I just refilled the aspirin and we changed your dose of gabapentin so that one has refills um.  Everything else, you only have two of glipizide, let me refill that one.  So everything else looks good. Just call if you find something for your [REDACTED].  Um.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Alright so we talked about the diabetes, we talked about your high blood pressure; everything else seems to be going really well.  Um unless there's anything else, I don't think we'll make any changes until your next visit.  Just the gabapentin and we're giving you [REDACTED] some aspirin.
PATIENT: Cool.
DOCTOR: Start taking your blood pressure and keep the log for me okay.  Even just three times a week is fine.  A couple times a week just so I can see what you're running when you're at home alright.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah that way maybe I can keep my blood sugar.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's fine or I mean if it's [REDACTED] easier for you remember I'm fine with that.  So next time you come back me in another six months and we're gonna get labs in September and you know to fast before you come to your appointment in September though.  Otherwise I mean just the gabapentin and remember now it's gonna be, your new prescription when you get the new batch will say it so now you know you can take three pills in the morning, three with the lunch and three in the evening.  If that doesn't help, if that still doesn't help at all then call me.  Call the clinic and then we'll taper you down and get it off because it [REDACTED] to be on the medication and it's doing nothing then we'll try something else.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] next week.
DOCTOR: But it's something that's bothering you at night a little bit.
PATIENT: But I don't really do anything [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's from nerve pain.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's not a typical pain medication but we have some other medications that work for nerve pain also.  Um so if that one doesn't work for you we'll get you off of it.  Cause there's no point in your taking nine pills a day if it's doing nothing.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I don't like doing that to people.  But having you on this increased dose, see if that makes a difference at all okay.  And otherwise keep doing well on your diet.  Sounds like your sugars have been much better than they were.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Which I'm very pleased about.  I'm very pleased about.  Um so in September we'll see how that control is if it reflects on the hemoglobin A1c and make any changes that we need to at that time.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Good.  Lots of fresh vegetables are good um.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Here's how I eat a kiwi.
PATIENT: You peel it?
DOCTOR: No.  Peeling kiwi is really hard.  What I like to do is once it's ripe or a little bit soft, cut it down the middle where it's like so that when it's an oval.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You cut it down the middle like this.  So you have two little halves.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And then like eat it with a spoon.  Out of the skin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know cause I have a lot of trouble peeling them.  They're great [REDACTED] and they're extremely good for you.  They have more potassium than bananas and they have more vitamin C than oranges.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh yeah.
PATIENT: So yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Cut it down the middle and then eat out of the skin.  If it's ripe it'll come out just right.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Really, really.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Strawberry soup you know.
DOCTOR: But not real [REDACTED].  They're pretty good and they are good for you so remember not too much fresh fruit cause it does increase your sugar.
PATIENT: It does?
DOCTOR: Yeah so they're one of the natural sugars.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: They can hike up your sugars a little bit so if you’re seeing an increase in your sugars, just go easy on the fresh fruits.
PATIENT: That's what I'm doing [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So that's going to be [REDACTED] for you.  Try to do fresh vegetables.  Make [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: Well thank you doctor.
DOCTOR: You are welcome.  Good seeing you.  [REDACTED] you know.  [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: AT:  88:49.
Time is 12:35.
