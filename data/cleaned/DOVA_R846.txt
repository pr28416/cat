DOCTOR: Uh do you have enough supplies?  I know I renewed them all the last time.
PATIENT: The only thing I don't have is Bacitracin but I can get that.  I been getting stuff at Walgreen’s anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay and it's still draining just like what it was draining the last time huh.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay and you're taking, what medications are you taking by mouth?  Just the HIV's?
PATIENT: HIV, ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: For the pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, they gave me some, the doctor didn't tell me to take it but I been taking it because I have this infection on my neck.
DOCTOR: Who gave you that?
PATIENT: The doctor gave me some supplements, sulfa some kind of name or something.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah, anyway I been taking it and they told me to stop.  I started like taking it and it almost cleared this stuff up, it's a bacteria.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED] what do you put on it?
PATIENT: I put calamine lotion on it, you can barely see it, if you look last month when I came to see you, it was bad.  It was a hole in my neck.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It was a hole there and it was almost through the skin so you could see the bone in my throat but it's closing up now and so.  It's the [REDACTED] core infection where it feels like something is crawling beneath the skin, it's not contagious or anything.  The dermatologist is not seeing anything.
DOCTOR: Oh I remember this, I remember it now.
PATIENT: Yeah what's happening is things crawling on my skin, they like hairs but they white and they crawl through my skin and I, I have to have that and it's starting to clear up.
DOCTOR: I remember you were seeing a dermatologist about it.
PATIENT: Yes and it's clearing up.  They tried to tell me it was eczema and I don't have no eczema that radical.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Have a seat up here.  I am really sorry this would happen with the medications [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Oh, [REDACTED] I just didn't know.
DOCTOR: No it's good for me to know because it's important just to make sure.
PATIENT: He done told me that my HIV is non-detectable now.
DOCTOR: Yeah your HIV, so you got labs done, it looks on the 14th.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Right now it's pending but we're gonna have your CD4 count, which is your cell count and hopefully and your viral loads, the virus in your blood looks really good.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So it's good you're taking your medications.  It's ideal so you're not as prone to complications with the HIV.
PATIENT: What I'm thinking is that if I could stay on it, my health will improve.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I'm just trying to see, I can't remember where.
PATIENT: It's one of those things you know it's draining now.
DOCTOR: I remember.
PATIENT: It might get bigger.
DOCTOR: Oh right here.
PATIENT: It's small, it's about right here.
DOCTOR: Ah. [REDACTED] remember all this?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I don’t see. So did you just change this? Nothing’s draining.
PATIENT: It's draining, it's draining, it's draining but it's not big.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So what I'm saying is that everything is okay, but wait until it gets cold, then what's gonna happen, my legs is, all the skin is gonna break down on my legs again.  As long as I keep this going on.
DOCTOR: When do you see Podiatry?
PATIENT: Oh in about another two weeks is when it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath.  Okay look up.  Alright, have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so you have enough of your supplies.  They already sent your medications.
PATIENT: I did get them yeah.
DOCTOR: So you're good right now.
PATIENT: The only [REDACTED] if I'm gonna have the medication [REDACTED] gotta go to Walgreen’s, the reason I'm saying that is.
DOCTOR: I can give the bacitracin.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Definitely.
PATIENT: Definitely.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Cause I'm trying to keep the infection down.
DOCTOR: That I can do.
PATIENT: Anyway, the office and the forms [REDACTED]Damen Building, pretty soon we'll have to have you [REDACTED].  I don't have no [REDACTED].  You hear what I'm saying, I'm waiting for this to stop draining before I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then in the meantime with this much gauze and compressed on it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's keeping the swelling down.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So they wasn't complaining about me putting that on there.
DOCTOR: Well I'm going to refill your bacitracin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: There's no point [REDACTED].
PATIENT: So, now what do I do when I pick the form up today?  Just drop it here?
DOCTOR: You can drop it off with my nurse and I'll just get it to them within the week okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Only because today for some reason other than [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh no, I'm not even worrying about it.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: I'm just happy that I was able to have an appointment with you.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'm glad to see you.
PATIENT: Cause actually I'm trying to stick with the VA.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Before I die.
DOCTOR: Don't say things like that.
PATIENT: They told me that if I made it another hour, see I was bad when I had that bad infection in my neck.
DOCTOR: It's scary with infections.
PATIENT: And so what I'm saying is the VA are the ones that saved my life because still with the Air Force, if I had gone to to a hospital with the Air Force I would've died because I wouldn't have gotten medical care in time.  If something happens I can come to the VA Hospital.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Emergency Room and things do happen in life, know what I'm saying so that's why I did that you know.  But I need to get more of the medical insurance which I'm attempting to do now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know lately if the HIV, it kind of feels like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What do you mean like?
PATIENT: Why my leg does that.  They say I have osteomyelitis in my legs.
DOCTOR: It's in the legs yeah.  That could be.
PATIENT: And the veins in the leg and all that.
DOCTOR: Um, we'll probably gonna have you get a MRI but I want the doctor, the IV doctors to see you for that okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.

DOCTOR: Well you know, we've been rechecking everything to make sure you do, but it looks like you do.
