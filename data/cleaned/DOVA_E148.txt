DOCTOR: Hi.
PATIENT: How are you?
DOCTOR: Good, good to see you again.  How you doing?
PATIENT: Not too bad, not bad.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: I had uh, I had some disappointing news this morning, I looked, I uh, my diabetic, I been taking the wrong dosage of this medication so my sugar was up so I had to you know get it down again you know and yeah I have to, I wasn't eating right.  So I know that so you know I have to, cause I usually eat fairly good you know, track of that stuff you know so.  But we got that straightened out so.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: I was spanked [REDACTED].  She thought she was sending me home but I said no I had another appointment so.  Have you found out any results of that test?  Do you remember the test I took for my blood?
DOCTOR: The for your [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Well I know [REDACTED] and they didn't find anything.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: Okay now I went, I saw my heart doctor since then.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He said stay off Plavix.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I read that.
PATIENT: I have not, I'm anxious to see what my results are now on that.  See really the main reason I really wanted to come today, I haven't, you know I tried to get a hold of you several times.  You were on vacation or something like that, it was during Christmas.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Or December.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You were gone for a while and we were playing telephone tag.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And you called me from your house or you might even call me from home.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I really appreciate that.  I couldn't get a hold of you and you couldn't get a hold of me because every time you called, I called back and nothing.
DOCTOR: Oh I know, that happens sometimes, it's hard.  So your blood count is what you want to know.
PATIENT: Yeah I guess that's what I need to know, I have no idea what I need to know but.
DOCTOR: Well we'll.
PATIENT: As long as it looks good.
DOCTOR: So, your urine you still have some protein in your urine.
PATIENT: Yeah she told me that already yeah.
DOCTOR: You knew that already.  Yeah.  And you know about your A1c so I'll skip over that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: This is your CBC so infection-fighting cells look great, normal.  Hemoglobin that's what falls when you bleed.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So that's your, the blood count I think you're worried about.  13 is normal.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Where am I at?
DOCTOR: You're at 13.
PATIENT: 13 oh good.
DOCTOR: You're normal.
PATIENT: Good.  Now I cut back on the iron.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because you told me if after a month or I finished ferritin, I'm taking one a day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Is that right or not?
DOCTOR: Yeah so that's correct, that is what I told you um but I'm gonna show you we got some iron studies on you and your iron saturation's a little on the lower side so I definitely still keep and so is your iron 53.
PATIENT: Should I go up to two a day?
DOCTOR: Now have you had problems with constipation?  I think I'm going.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].  I mean I've been going but it's been really been [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You it just hasn't been you know and every once in a while I get a good bowel movement.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But it seems like every three days is a good bowel movement.  Every other day it's kind of sort of okay, today I have not had one.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So, I’m constipated now, as we speak.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean that's why I feel constipation I'm probably not but who knows but when I go, I go, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I don't know why but I'm taking two a day, two of those um, you know those laxative things.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I need to, I got plenty of those.
DOCTOR: The Docusate Senna.
PATIENT: I've got plenty of those.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well you only have one refill so I'll refill those for you.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: So my thing with the iron is, I think you should at least continue to take one a day.  If you can't handle it.
PATIENT: Oh I say if it's normal I'll [REDACTED] again.
DOCTOR: Because of the constipation I don't think you necessarily have to go up to two a day, you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Those really are constipating pills.  You're not so low your hemoglobin, which is that blood count is in the normal range.
PATIENT: That's what I been [REDACTED], I was really worried about that.
DOCTOR: So I'm fine with staying at one, one a day.
PATIENT: I haven't had any chest pain.  Remember I had chest pains on you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I don't have it anymore.
DOCTOR: Oh wonderful.
PATIENT: And I think that's because I didn't have any blood you know.
DOCTOR: That's kind of essential for life, you gotta have blood.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: So do you want to go over the rest of your labs or did she go over those with you?
PATIENT: Who?
DOCTOR: Uh the diabetic doctor.
PATIENT: Yeah she went over some stuff.  You can tell me what you want to tell me and then.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So cholesterol.
PATIENT: Yeah I got all that.
DOCTOR: Got all that.
PATIENT: Yeah and she said it was high.
DOCTOR: Um your electrolytes look good.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Your creatinine looks great.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So you're at 0.8.
PATIENT: I was worried about my electrolytes, I really was.  I thought that I would uh, now what's making me feel, I feel a little dizzy sometimes.  Could that be because my sugar is high?  It's not dizzy, it’s light-headed.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Dizzy, a little bit, just a little bit.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I used to feel real lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Now it's just a little bit lately but about the last two weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not all the time.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: A little bit once in a while.
DOCTOR: Is it only when you're standing or immediately after you stand up?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not like it used to be uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Lightheaded even when you're sitting sometimes?
PATIENT: Well, like they took my test this morning on my lower end of my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It was 40.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: 48 I believe it was.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that's low.  Why is that, what causes that being low like that, can you tell me that?
DOCTOR: Variations in blood pressure and we've got you on blood pressure medicine um to control your blood pressure.  So really that low number um, a 48, shouldn't be causing you symptoms of lightheadedness.
PATIENT: Okay so that, so it must be, I guarantee it's probably my sugar then.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I mean it could be your blood pressure but I'd be more worried about the higher number being real low causing lightheadedness than the lower number being a little bit lower.
PATIENT: Now I get this [REDACTED] lightheaded and it's, I can't even put it into words.  It's not all the time, it's just very, once in a while it lasts about maybe 10 minutes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: For some reason.  My diabetic person said I got to get more exercise and uh I know I work but it's still not enough exercise.  You know what I mean; I'm not getting really much over there.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I mean I do some things but I don't do anything real physical nor do I want to do anything real physical.  I want to do more aerobic type things like walking and stuff like that you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I don't [REDACTED].  I do a lot of standing and sitting.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What's your plan to do more exercise?
PATIENT: Um I'll tell you what, plan B is I have no plan.  Plan A is I have less than no plan um but I was thinking now that my sugar is you know, I'm starting to get a little concerned about it and uh I have, where I work is this gorgeous park.  I mean everybody and their brother's walking around this darn place and I'm not doing anything, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I watch them walk you know but I don't do a damn thing to help you know so.  I don't know.
DOCTOR: So how many days a week do you work?
PATIENT: Too many.  I work between five and six days a week.
DOCTOR: Five and six days a week.
PATIENT: And I work eight hours a day when I work.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But it's not hard work.  It's just like once in a while he'll have me come, I'll stay late at night.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause I'm what they call, I work opposite him.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He's doing this, I'm doing that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay so I'm like they call a closer.  You know [REDACTED] the closer only, well I close okay.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: As long as I can make sure the person's really [REDACTED] and again that's a little stressful but not real stressful.  It's not like my old job used to be you know when I was really working.  You know this is a piece of cake believe me compared to what I used to do.  But then I have to come in early in the morning.  See I leave between 8:30 9 o'clock at night and pretty soon it'll be 9:30 at night and I have to come in at quarter after five in the morning.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And every time I do, that takes me about a day and a half to recover from that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Because I don't get to sleep right away.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Takes me forever to fall asleep.
DOCTOR: Well you know I think you need to make a point of at least three times a week to either show up to work early or you know stay late, depending on whether you're working late, come early and walk you know.
PATIENT: Yeah just take a, I could even go once around the place and it's be more than I'm doing now for crying out loud.
DOCTOR: Exactly.  It doesn't need to be anything big, huge.  Even if you start with you know a ten minute stroll would be.
PATIENT: It's getting out of bed.
DOCTOR: A ten minute stroll to get out of bed, that's kind of like a 20 minute stroll you know.
PATIENT: I know what you mean.
DOCTOR: So that should be uh, that should be your plan, small, small goals that have, it set and say you're gonna do it and then do it and then you can say come back and see me soon.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And say DOCTOR guess what I did? I've been walking three times a week for ten minutes and I'm feeling better you know.
PATIENT: So instead of saying doctor I'm a lazy bum.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: I'm gonna say I've been walking.
DOCTOR: And then I'm gonna cheer for you.
PATIENT: There you go, I love that.  I love when someone cheers for me you know.
DOCTOR: I know, I do too.
PATIENT: Cause usually they call me the bum of the month or something like that over at work you know, no I'm just kidding you.
DOCTOR: (Laughter)
PATIENT: No I kind of, it's kind of fun we have a real fun group over there.  So you know.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: It's a dream job for most guys.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Really I mean and girls, it's really nice over there you know.  Too bad they don't pay you what a doctor gets paid cause you could work over there with us.  I'd just love to have you come.
DOCTOR: Oh well thank you.
PATIENT: You'd love that job cause you're out in the air all the time and now, three days a week I drive around in the golf cart.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well I do get more exercise when I do that because I get out and I move around a little bit you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: When I'm in the shop, I'm just running up the register you know, let me have your money you know, you know what I mean.  I make change to everybody that comes and I stand there.  I don't really get nothing, yeah I'll start.  That's where we're at so, so you think everything looks pretty good there as far as my hemoglobin and all that other stuff.
DOCTOR: Yep, as far as numbers.  Any blood in your stools that you see?
PATIENT: No, no I've been looking, no um.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And in my urine no, uh uh.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Now I had a urine test today, is that mostly for diabetics?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yep.  So and you're on the proper meds to try and prevent any kidney disease from the diabetes, the losartan so.
PATIENT: I think I need that um, my scripts I want to look at this one right here.

PATIENT: That's due pretty soon isn't it?
DOCTOR: You have eight refills.
PATIENT: Yeah and is that due pretty soon here on my refills?
DOCTOR: Yeah it was filled April 30th so yeah you probably need to renew that.
PATIENT: Oh right.
DOCTOR: Let me refill that.  Mail it to you?
PATIENT: Mail it to me please.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And Crestor, I don't think I need Crestor.
DOCTOR: Last filled May 10th.
PATIENT: Yeah I got enough of that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um what else you giving me um.  You know since you gave me those pills for my blood pressure, the blue little pills, what are they called um, let's see.
DOCTOR: I don't know names of them.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I can look in my records. Was it a new med?.
PATIENT: Uh yeah, it was because you put me on it because my blood pressures were real high and I wasn't, you know [REDACTED] I take two now.  I used to take one, now I'm taking two.
DOCTOR: Imdur to 60 maybe, I increased your uh, I increased this one and isosorbide mononitrate.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: What's been happening since you took that?
PATIENT: I took [REDACTED] pills.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I've been sleeping better.  You know what I mean, I haven't I ever since I got that, you know where they gave me the new blood you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I've been sleeping much much better.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Cause you know I didn't sleep for almost a year and a half.
DOCTOR: Oh that's true.
PATIENT: I mean not that's terrible.  For an hour, an hour and a half a night you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I’m going to the bathroom less and less.  Only when my sugar level's up do I go to the bathroom more.
DOCTOR: That will do it.
PATIENT: You know so.
DOCTOR: That'll do it.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I got one little joke to tell you before I leave okay.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Okay, um this guy is really having problems he’s you know.  He's having sexual problems so he goes to the doctor and says at my age I shouldn't be having these problems I don't know what's the matter with me he says doctors says uh well he says what we can do here is take this jar, fill it up.  He says okay.  He says do you need anything like uh magazines or DVDs?  He goes nope doc I'll take care of everything.  He goes away and goes home, comes back the next day.  Doctor looks at the jar nothing.  He says what happened, he says well doc he said I got home, I put the DVD in, he said I tried my right hand and nothing happened.  Tried with my left hand nothing happened.  So I called my wife and she tried with the right hand nothing, she tried with the left hand nothing happening.  I called my neighbor and she came over, tried with her right hand nothing, tried with the left hand nothing and she said.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And he said you called your neighbor to help you out with this?  And he said yes and she couldn't get the lid off the jar either.
DOCTOR: (Laughter)
PATIENT: Isn't that cute.
DOCTOR: That's good, that's good.
PATIENT: That you can tell your friends, a little VA humor.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that was funny.
PATIENT: Anyway is there anything else you need from me?
DOCTOR: Yeah I want to retake your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay.

DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: On this arm, do you want to try it?
DOCTOR: I could try it.
PATIENT: Alright give it a shot.
DOCTOR: I usually don't have a problem.
PATIENT: Give it a shot.
DOCTOR: I might need the larger cuff though, we'll see.  Alright it was fine for me.  I gotcha about 128/74.
PATIENT: Oh that sounds good.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's probably what it should be [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It is 130/80.  Deep breath in for me good.  Alright that's good.  So one thing you are due for a tetanus shot.
PATIENT: I had one.
DOCTOR: You did?  I'll have to look again.
PATIENT: I'm ahead of you.
DOCTOR: You are, good for you.
PATIENT: And it hurt for about a month.  It did, it was an owie.
DOCTOR: I believe you, those can be terrible and you've got just a touch of swelling in your legs.
PATIENT: No I had, every time I come she says the same thing, a little bit not much though.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Maybe it's the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I believe so.
PATIENT: No I feel good about that you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I have blood so I feel good about that, it's pumping.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know all things being equal.
DOCTOR: Things are looking up right.
PATIENT: I couldn't ask for anything else.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Putting some of my paperwork in order here.

DOCTOR: How have I been?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Been doing good, very good.
PATIENT: So things are going good for you as far as getting by you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You're in your last year now?
DOCTOR: No this is the end of my first year.
PATIENT: They'll go by fast.
DOCTOR: Two more years for me.
PATIENT: Let us pray.  It's gonna be a long, I mean it's a long haul, seems like forever.  For you it must seem like forever.
DOCTOR: Well, yeah it can be tough but uh.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But so far, so good, but I have two weeks left of work and then I have about a two week vacation before I start my next year so.
PATIENT: Now will you be, are you gonna be um, what do you study for?
DOCTOR: So I will get board certified in internal medicine by the end of this three years and I'll take a test and board certify in that.  So I'll be general internal medicine.  If I want to go on and do a specialty then I'll have to do a fellowship in that and I haven't decided.  I think I will probably just do general internal medicine, I just stay treating.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I mean there's a lot of GPs out there so you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That ought to help you out a little bit you know what I mean.  You can get with anybody.  They're always looking for a [REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: A lot of people are retiring now days, especially in Indiana.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED].  I think you know I enjoy doing a little bit of everything.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Kind of taking care of the patient as a whole and just being available for whatever they need.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: Let me ask you this, do you have any special area you want to live in, you know like Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, you know what I mean as far as where you'd want to live?
DOCTOR: I think I want to live in Kansas.
PATIENT: In Kansas, now are you from Kansas?
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: So you want to go back home.
DOCTOR: I think so yeah.  In fact uh my parents live there and I have my brother and his wife and nieces and nephews.
PATIENT: Yeah all of your family there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah I've been through Kansas you know but never, the city itself.  I had once; I had a couple steaks there.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's about all I can say you know cause I stay overnight you know when I was traveling, a long time ago and uh I always liked Kansas I mean, what I saw of it, you know.  People seemed to be pretty friendly there, Midwesterners.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I would say, wouldn't you say Midwesterners?
DOCTOR: Definitely.  That's really good.
PATIENT: But that's good, at least you get to go home you know.  Cause there's always something and you think, believe in the medicine field and the doctor field and all the hospitals, you should be okay.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: They’ll never be short of that.
DOCTOR: I know.  I feel very blessed that I'll probably always be able to have a job, find a job.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So tell me what is your plan for the diabetes?  When are you following up with them?
PATIENT: Three months.
DOCTOR: Three months okay, alright.  Then I don't think you necessarily need to see me in three months.
PATIENT: Not unless I, unless I have chest pains or something like that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I will call you or go into the, if I have real bad chest pain I'll go into the Emergency Room.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I'm going to, I told my cardiologist that I would uh call the doctor and let him know cause he was really concerned about it.  Cause before that, I said that blood thing must have done it, I mean that must have been cause my heart was working too hard I guess.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: For some reason.
DOCTOR: We call it demand ischemia so.
PATIENT: Okay.  If you say so.  You don't have to call it, you can call it Ray and you can call it Jay but you got to call it demand what is it?
DOCTOR: Demand.
PATIENT: Demand.
DOCTOR: Demand, so your heart is demanding.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then ischemia means uh kind of like hypoxia, that it's damaging the heart because your heart is working so hard.
PATIENT: So I'm [REDACTED] oxygen [REDACTED] everything.
DOCTOR: Yep, that's what it was.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: So I think six months would be good to see you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let me just talk with my attending and I'll be back.
PATIENT: Okay one thing.
DOCTOR: Of course.
PATIENT: Probably around December, when I quit, when I stop working again this year.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's probably when I'll probably see you.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause it doesn't make any difference between November and December, I'll make it work but if you want to put down December and then just set a date for that you know, that would work so.
DOCTOR: Sounds good.
PATIENT: Okay kiddo.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Sounds great doc.
DOCTOR: Give me just a few minutes okay.
PATIENT: Thank you so much.
DOCTOR: Of course.
(DOCTOR OUT:  35:45  DOCTOR IN:  45:50)
DOCTOR: Alright.  So two more things, you have some low platelets, have you heard that term before?  Yeah so you've been losing blood for over a year and.
PATIENT: What are they?
DOCTOR: So they're a component in your blood that helps blood clotting and they're not so low that you're at risk for bleeding or.
PATIENT: Well that's because I'm taking all this medication, I'm on medication for the blood pressure medication.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's a blood thinner, I'm taking all this crap [REDACTED] its working.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Which is gonna lead me to have whatever the hell it is.  I know that I bleed, I bleed better you know than I used to.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know and uh now what do we want to do with that?
DOCTOR: So there are some lab studies we could do and then send you to a hematologist or specialist which is a blood specialist.
PATIENT: For?  But that means I have to pay money for that though.  If it's not important do you think I need to go I mean yet?
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: Could we wait till next time to see where I'm at?  I mean I'm sure they're not going to be real worse.  I mean higher.  I'm sure I'm not going to increase any but I don't.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Really want to go at this time with my financial situation because I have to pay now.  I have to pay uh so much per visit.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And in some ways, I don't have insurance.  I mean you know that's one thing cause I'm seeing four doctors now.
DOCTOR: I know.  That's a lot.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  So I don't know what to do I mean.  Now what else is there, what else is this thing, the platelets are what is it, I'm low on platelets or?
DOCTOR: Yep low platelets.
PATIENT: I got nothing on my plate, what is this?
DOCTOR: So low platelets and you know I would expect you to bleed more because you're on the medicines but even being on these medicines the platelets are lower than what I would expect.
PATIENT: What are they supposed to be?
DOCTOR: So greater than 150.
PATIENT: I can't see what they were.
DOCTOR: You're at 62.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And yours have not been normal since oh about a here or so, 2009.
PATIENT: Well what causes that?
DOCTOR: October 2009.
PATIENT: Well what would cause that?
DOCTOR: So because I don't know the cause is why I'm sending, you know recommending that you go see.
PATIENT: Okay, I'll tell you what make me an appointment or do I have to make it myself.
DOCTOR: I'll put in a consult.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then they'll schedule you for an appointment.
PATIENT: Why don't we say sometime in uh August?
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: August or September cause you know what I like to have it the same time I go see my diabetic.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that'll be in September, sometime in there.  I'd like to get them together.  You know if I'm gonna go, then I don't mind going in you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's not the fact that I even have the tests.  It's not that at all it's just, it's expensive.  It is expensive for me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah it's not overly expensive I mean you know but.
DOCTOR: I know you work hard and.
PATIENT: I'm just the visit you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And the visit, since I used to never have to pay for the visits, now I have to pay you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then what else do you want me to do?  What's the other thing?
DOCTOR: Um if you're open for getting lab work or if you want to wait on the lab work I would be more amenable to that.
PATIENT: What are you getting lab work like what?  Oh for that?
DOCTOR: Blood drawn.
PATIENT: What platelets?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I just had blood drawn.
DOCTOR: Today.
PATIENT: Today.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So what would they do extra?
DOCTOR: B12 and folate, those are the two uh vitamins.
PATIENT: Vitamins could be low.
DOCTOR: Your vitamins.
PATIENT: Do you want to give me those?  Or am I taking those, taking something like that now?
DOCTOR: No I just want to see what your levels are in your blood.  I don't necessarily want to start more drugs.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  No I don't want to do more drugs really.  I don't you know.
DOCTOR: No I don't either so you know if you want to wait and do all.
PATIENT: I'll do what I'm supposed to do yeah.
DOCTOR: The labs in August, September.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's fine.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I'm going to have give blood for the Diabetic Clinic anyways so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I don't care though.
DOCTOR: I'll put it in at that time.
PATIENT: They've drawn more blood from me than you know.  I'm probably down to 9 now after they do all the blood this morning.  You know it's no big deal bleeding because you know what it doesn't really bother me and that's uh, it is pain you know, a little blood doesn't really stop me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Tell them I'm amendable to that, to your suggestion because you are the best doctor in the whole world.
DOCTOR: Oh now you're just.
PATIENT: And.
DOCTOR: Being too nice.
PATIENT: No I'm not too nice; I just say what's in my heart.  You can't, you can't deny, you can’t call me a liar, talking about a man's heart you can't.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.  Remember that line too, in case someone pulls it on you.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright that's it.  And let me know if you have any problems and good to see you.
PATIENT: I have another joke for you if you want to hear it.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: It's kind of cute you know.  A choir boy he said something like, you he's got to go to confession.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: He says Father; forgive me Father for I have sinned.  Father says what's the matter my son?  He said well Father he says I've had illicit relationships with a member of our church.  He goes you have, son.  Yes I have.  He goes do I happen to know this young lady is it?  And he goes yes.  Yes, you do Father, you do know her.  He goes you care to tell me who it is?  And he goes no; I don't want to tell you who it is.  You know you would think I don’t want to hold that information back but I don't think it's relevant because.  He says well in a way it is I mean you know.  Well let me just say this, could it be a person named Ann and he goes, no.  I can't tell you Father.  He says how about, Mary.  No, how about, Sue?  No.  [REDACTED] the names of two more girls right.  He goes no none of them.  He goes well I'll tell you here's your penitence.  I want you to say 40 Hail Mary's, 40 Our Father's and because you have really sinned I want you to have four months off from the altar, you cannot be an altar boy.  Father I… no my son that's my final, you cannot be an altar boy for four months.  Okay, so he goes up the stairs and all the guys are standing out waiting for him to come on out because he was taking up and they go what happened.  Well the bad news is I have to say 40 Hail Mary's and 40 Our Father's.  The good news is I get four months vacation and I have five new leads.
DOCTOR: (Laughter)
PATIENT: Isn't that cute?
DOCTOR: That is cute.
PATIENT: Anyway talk to you later.
