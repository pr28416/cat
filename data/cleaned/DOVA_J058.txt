Let me see, 116 or something like that.
DOCTOR: Is it ever lower than 100?
SECOND PERSON J058
Very rarely.
DOCTOR: When was the last time though?
SECOND PERSON J058
Uh see if I can find it.  Well, we were on vacation a few occasions they were low but I really can't say.  When we were moving around you know it's really not that bad.

SECOND PERSON J058
No.

SECOND PERSON J058

SECOND PERSON J058

DOCTOR: Okay.  Um okay and when was the last time you saw the oncologist?  They look at your lung cancer.
SECOND PERSON J058
Been about six or eight months.
DOCTOR: Are you due to see them soon?
PATIENT: Uh not aware, I think it was rescheduled.
SECOND PERSON J058
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON J058
There were more reasons that we rescheduled it, that appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay and you were supposed to, in June, I think it was June when you saw them?
PATIENT: Perhaps uh. It’s been awhile.
DOCTOR: Well I see one from January [REDACTED] in June.  When was the last CT scan of his chest?
SECOND PERSON J058
Probably uh, it should be uh prior to that to the oncology examination.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON J058
See what happened is he came from Florida.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON J058
From a nursing home and uh they uh he didn't bring any records with him and so they asked me to go and see if I could happen to [REDACTED] because they wanted to uh, some information about what really happened.
DOCTOR: Sure.
SECOND PERSON J058
With that and so it took me a while to get that information and when I found that, I got the information for the actual treatment that he took for his lung cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON J058
And but I think [REDACTED], well everything's fine, they concluded [REDACTED] or follow-up and then the CT [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay and you don't feel like your heart is racing right now or anything like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay and you took your blood pressure medicine this morning?
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON J058
Uh let me, if I may, uh we are doing vascular exercises.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON J058
He just started that uh two weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON J058
That might be the reason why his blood pressure is dropping because he's been on this medication [REDACTED] for a while but we just recently started this exercise.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON J058
So that might be suppressing his blood pressure because he's just never been on exercise before.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah I mean it is low.
SECOND PERSON J058
Yeah.
DOCTOR: But the fact that he's not having any symptoms kind of makes me less worried.
SECOND PERSON J058
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Cause your blood pressure can drop for many reasons but if you're not having symptoms from it you know, if you're having infection, you're not drinking enough fluids, you're eating and drinking okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you're making good urine and still urinating [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm going to get the thing and recheck it, okay.  But I'm gonna take a quick listen to your heart and lungs.  And you actually see the neurologist and they do injections is that right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You had one.
SECOND PERSON J058
[REDACTED] shot.
DOCTOR: Yeah and where did they do it?
SECOND PERSON J058
Well they've done, they've done some in his arm and they’s done some on his paralyzed side, the arm and the lower [REDACTED].

SECOND PERSON J058

DOCTOR: Right, on both sides.
SECOND PERSON J058

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Okay.  Take a deep breath.  One more time.  One more time.  Release it. Once more.  You can breathe normally now.  No belly pain or anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No pain with urination?  Can you open your mouth?  Take your glasses off for a second.  Okay.  Are you able to move this arm at all?  Okay and then what about this arm can you hold it straight up, push it up, don't let me push it down good.  Are you able to lift this leg up?  Is that an improvement from before?  Okay and what about this one?  [REDACTED] This one again, okay good.  Okay let me grab the blood pressure machine okay.  [REDACTED] sit up here, are you able to do that?
SECOND PERSON J058

DOCTOR: Sorry I'll just be quick and then I can get you back in a chair okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I think it's a little bit hard because you can't move your arm out completely, right.  Sorry, I know you’re uncomfortable, I’m just trying to make sure that nothing is going on, okay?  Did you take a flu shot this year?  Okay, this is the last time I'll take it in this arm and then I'll let you get off the table okay.  Okay.  Alright I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR but you can come back and have a seat here; you'll help him get back to the chair right?
