(DOCTOR OUT:  72:36  DOCTOR IN:  80:17)
DOCTOR: Okay, do you remember when your last tetanus shot was?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Have you had one in the last ten years do you think?
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: If not we do a booster shot every ten years.
PATIENT: Oh.

PATIENT: Well yeah I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um.
PATIENT: Um when I came, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I got the tuberculosis thing but I don't remember having them reading it.
DOCTOR: Was it a skin test?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay um so.  Have you ever been exposed to anybody with TB like in your family that you know of?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay and so given that you are um, so you're from Mexico originally which is considered a high risk area.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And these are areas where they have TB there and also because you in the service that's why they normally do a screen test but if you're not having any symptoms of TB which is things like weight loss or cough, coughing up blood you know, night sweats, things like that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Then we really don't.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Need to do anything, we could do a screening test [REDACTED] if you've been exposed to TB.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so you don't actually have any symptoms of having the disease.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh we may consider doing that later because if you've been exposed to it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um and that test is positive it can tell us that you may be at risk for getting the disease of TB later, so like the way TB works, you get exposed to it and then it kind of just hides out and then one day later reactivates and that's when you get the lung disease.  So we would treat you if you just showed, if the test is positive and it just showed that you were exposed to it.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Um we'd treat you with the medication for like nine months and then help with it or prevent it from actually ever getting to the real tuberculosis.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But let's focus on a couple of other things today.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: First [REDACTED] and the TB skin test okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Oh the nurse, when you check in and usually every time the nurses, they do this, they have to ask you questions kind of a little checking system that we do so we help us catch things and um there were some questions in here regarding like your time in service thing you know uh that you've been having nightmares about your time in service, things like that.  Constantly guardful, watchful, easily startled, things like that and those can be symptoms of PTSD.  Have you ever heard of that before?
PATIENT: I've heard of it but never really.
DOCTOR: So it stands for post-traumatic stress disorder um and its, you know easily [REDACTED] symptoms and disturbances and just from you're daily living but these questions sometimes can help me know uh if you want me to investigate, you know ask about those, so how do you feel I guess about your thoughts on these questions you know.  Do you feel like your thoughts are significantly affecting your daily life?  Do you feel depressed?
PATIENT: No I don't feel depressed.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like you need to, would you like to talk to somebody more about?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Has this been going on since you left the service?
PATIENT: Um yeah I guess but it sort of, basically um when I came back.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I just didn't feel right here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I didn't want to be here, I wanted to go back but it took about a year um.  I would be taking, almost for a year, I was taking uh Nyquil to go to sleep cause I just couldn't go to sleep.  If I woke up, cause I went to sleep like for three hours and something would wake me up, I just could not go back to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I would have to take like Nyquil to actually help me relax but now I can just sleep a full night.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And but other than that, I think I'm alright.
DOCTOR: So if anything changes you should let us know because we do have a lot of other things you know to help with that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's a very common experience so you know it's something that we need to try to have you treat.  So if anything changes just let me know.  Um in the meantime I do want to get some blood work from you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So like I said the cholesterol level should be fasting.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Since you're coming back in a week anyway.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We can wait till then to do it.
PATIENT: Okay next time.
DOCTOR: That’s fine by me. I mean um you're appointment's at 8 a.m. so you may have to be the first one in line for the lab.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then go upstairs or you can do it afterwards.
PATIENT: Well where's it at now?
DOCTOR: It's right down here on the first floor.
PATIENT: Okay.  So I show up over there first?
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: And then what do I do?
DOCTOR: You tell them your name and your last four, they'll have the order, they'll see it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And they can draw your blood.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Do you um your appointment's at 8 though so maybe you should go to the GI Clinic first so they can see you and then go down to the Lab.
PATIENT: Where is the GI Clinic.
DOCTOR: GI Clinic.
PATIENT: Where is it at?
DOCTOR: That's for the GI doctors that you have your appointment in a week for.
PATIENT: Oh gotcha.
DOCTOR: So they can talk about maybe doing the colonoscopy.
PATIENT: So go to the GI Clinic first?
DOCTOR: I would suggest doing that first so you don't get late for your appointment.  Um your appointment's at 8, so it's like the first appointment they have.
PATIENT: So I need to go to my appointment first then go to the Lab right?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, you can to do that.
PATIENT: Now where's the GI Clinic, what floor?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Otherwise I'll be walking around the hospital all day.
DOCTOR: It's on the second floor, okay so this long hall right.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Right here, the one that is out there um there is a set of elevators right across the hallway.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's the second floor of that building.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So it's the Specialty Clinic.
PATIENT: Specialty Clinic.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um let's see.
PATIENT: The blood work they can't draw today?
DOCTOR: I think we'll do it all together that day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's fine.  What's a phone number where I can reach you?
PATIENT: Uh NUMBER.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: NUMBER.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: NUMBER.  So who's going to be my regular doctor?
DOCTOR: So it would be me.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Except I'm graduating in three weeks so.
PATIENT: Then it'll be someone else.
DOCTOR: It'll be a new resident yeah.  Um DOCTOR is the attending in the Gold Clinic.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So he's the attending that oversees all of us and that's DOCTOR um but at this clinic that'll be the next time you come in or the next time you come back.  Uh okay, so I put in an order for you to get an appointment with the eye doctors and if you just want to stop out front to talk with the clerk.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Right here that you checked in with they can make you an appointment with the eye doctors.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We'll get the labs next week and the other thing I can order you some of the heartburn medications from our Pharmacy here.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: If you wanted to try and see it.  I don't know how much it'll cost you here versus buying over-the-counter but you can go to the Pharmacy and ask them.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Here okay so.  Um [REDACTED] are you working right now?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: What are you doing right now?
PATIENT: I drive a mixer truck.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um I don't know how much time you have but we have this thing called the MOVE Program that is a weight loss program and so it's not, it's different for each person it's not like, there are specific, well, there are specific times you have to be there but they can work with your schedule and things like that if you're interested.  There's a meeting every Monday at 10 to talk about it and you can learn different things about that.  I really think like especially that your weight is contributing to the back problem.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's very common actually.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So the more weight you can lose the better it's going to be in the back.  In the meantime you should definitely, you can use some Tylenol if you have significant pain but otherwise you know just doing exercising as you are, continue to do that cause keeping the muscles around your lower back strong helps prevent them from getting worse as well.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um let me go talk to the nurse to see if they can give you that tetanus shot.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So [REDACTED] time um.  Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: She'll call you when they're ready to give you your shot and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: 91:23
