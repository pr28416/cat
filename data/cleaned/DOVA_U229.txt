PATIENT: Yeah, right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  We should get you on a trial of Flomax.
PATIENT: Flomax?
DOCTOR: Chances are your prostrate’ s pretty big.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Flomax [REDACTED].  There are two medicines they use in prostate whenever the prostate is a little big.  It’s something we use with guys. The prostate is kind of sort of a bitch of an organ in terms of you know, as we get older it gets bigger and it causes more problems.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I see [REDACTED], you know, you know they been doing [REDACTED].  Just started doing it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I know.  It is, fortunately, we have some really, really good medications to treat symptoms of BPH.  That is probably what you got.  Um, going to have to do a rectal though and I know it’s not the more pleasant in the world, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Make sure you don’t have any sort of masses or anything back there, you know, that could be possible cancer.  I am not saying you have cancer.  Most likely you have just some enlargement of the prostate which is stuff that guys get as they get older.
PATIENT: Oh, okay.
DOCTOR: So it most likely what it is.  Um, any back pain at all, that you have had?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] goes around my waist.
DOCTOR: But that is nothing new right?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.  Sounds good.  Um, your blood pressure is doing great today.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: I am really happy with where it is at.  Um, as far as [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I take that every morning.
DOCTOR: Good, good, good.  You are taking lisinopril 10 and amlodipine 10.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] take less [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  You know what, it is going to be a little tricky because I want to give you a little bit of a water pill.  To help get get off that extra fluid, it’s going to help your legs but I want to make sure you are peeing okay otherwise it’s going to be really un comfortable.  You know, so maybe we will wait and see if the peeing symptoms clear up for a little bit and then once you go to the bathroom regularly with an average stream, you can start the water pill.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It will help you, actually you might be able to back off one of the meds and substitute the amlodipine. We’ll work in that.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: We’ll work on that.  I will talk to my boss and we will come up with a medication regimen that will be better for your legs.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Because amlodipine may actually make your legs swell up or not.  So may need to take that off and cover you with something for a little bit.  We will talk about it.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Let me take a listen to you and then we will have to do the rectal.  At least a guy doing it and not a girl huh?
PATIENT: Yeah.

PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: How much you spend, how much is a pack for you?
PATIENT: Say five fifty.
DOCTOR: Five fifty?
PATIENT: Sometimes 5 dollars a pack.
DOCTOR: Let’s say 5.50 and you go through about a pack and a half every day, three times, [REDACTED], let’s say about ten and a half packs a week right?
PATIENT: Hm hmm.  [REDACTED]. Get them for five dollars a pack of cigarettes [REDACTED] you know they seven dollars.  So I can get them for about five dollars a pack.

PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know, I know buddy.  I know.  I just got to make sure it’s nothing you know, it’s smooth.  You don’t have any nodules.  Hey, [REDACTED] okay?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Believe me I don’t like doing that either.  Like I said, luckily it is a guy doing it, it’s not a female. A little bit more. Have you ever had this done?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: No?  Even I have had it done.  I had to go in the hospital one time because I was having problems urinating and they had to do it for me. I tell you, it’s not pleasant.  It’s got to be done.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, drop your pants.  Okay, and, feel a little a little bit of pressure.  Now you are going to feel a little bit of pressure, [REDACTED].  Okay.  [REDACTED].  A little pressure.  Okay.  From side to side.  That hurt at all?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Just uncomfortable right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.  Here you go buddy.  That’s it.  It’s over.  Here are some towels you can wipe yourself down.  Completely smooth and [REDACTED].  No nodules.  [REDACTED] nothing to suggest cancer.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] trial of Flomax.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Alright and uh, I might check your cholesterol today too.  Alright.   I will be right back buddy.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: 49:35  DOCTOR IN:  64:40
DOCTOR: Alright, guy. I talked it over with the boss.  We are going to make a few changes to your meds today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I was telling you before that the Amlodipine can make the swelling in your legs worse.  So we’re going to cut that out.  No more Amolodipine.  We are going to start you on a water pill and a pill for your prostate.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so we are, I know we’re taking away one and we are adding two but I think we are going to really help the swelling in your legs.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: I think it’s really going to help it.  [REDACTED].  And then we are also going to get you stockings to push the fluid back in.
PATIENT: What kind of stockings are these?
DOCTOR: They are called compression stockings.  Basically they are really tight fitting socks and the come up to right about here.  And they are tight fitting and they squeeze all of the fluid back into the veins.  Because what happens in your veins, veins normally take up blood from down here and they bring it back to the heart.  And veins have little valves in them so the blood moves up a little bit, the valve closes and it doesn’t come back down.  Your valves kinda stay open like that so the blood constantly comes back down.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: The pressure of the arteries taking the blood to the feet, and the veins trying to back up, that pressure is goes up down here and the extra fluid is pushed down into the leg.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  If you keep putting pressure on this way, your heart is putting pressure this way, but the veins aren’t doing their job because they are faulty and so the pressure goes up and fluid leaks out.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay?  The trick is, let’s try to squeeze that fluid back into the veins, basically what we are creating is an artificial valve in your legs, with the compression stockings.  Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, sounds good.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Alright, so let me um, we are doing to discontinue the amlodipine today.  Okay.  And let me get you that water pill too.  Alright and you can go to uh, actually go [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You got [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] water pill, too. [REDACTED] checklist [REDACTED] forget what needs to be done [REDACTED]. Here we are, one... two...   Prosthetics Department, stockings, three, pharmacy to pick up meds.  I added terazosin, and chlorthalidone.  Stop amlodipine.  Stop at the nurses’ station and get your vaccination.  Then go up to Prosthetics real quick and pick up your stockings so you have them before the weekend.  And then come down to the Pharmacy.
PATIENT: Oh okay.  Appreciate it doc.  Nice meeting you.
