PATIENT: How are you?  Hello doc.
DOCTOR: Hey, I was looking for you.
PATIENT: I uh.
DOCTOR: How do you do.
PATIENT: I'm doing that on Monday, Fridays.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Uh we have [REDACTED] comfortable but.  How are you today?
PATIENT: Doing okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Are you here uh for a check-up?
PATIENT: You see I got this thing and I don't know what it is down here.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You got a little bit of a wart; it looks like it's got infected.
PATIENT: I think it's just.
DOCTOR: How long has that been going on for?
PATIENT: It started, it's why they burst, you know I put a Band-Aid on, I put some compression and put a Band-Aid on.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's probably the best thing to do uh I mean there's nothing really you know we can give you here for it other than just advice to keep it clean and dry and you know.
PATIENT: I keep it clean.
DOCTOR: Avoid like you know getting dirt in it.
PATIENT: And that's why I put a Band-Aid on it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got to wash it, I could say at least three times a day and keep it clean, good.
PATIENT: But I have no more Band-Aids.
DOCTOR: Um so as far as a general uh health maintenance stuff I think that uh the blood pressure is probably a little bit on the high side today uh.  Did you have a chance to take your medicines this morning or?
PATIENT: I forgot to take it today.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  Well like do you need a refill on any of them or?
PATIENT: Yeah just mail it to me.
DOCTOR: Just mail it at home to you?  Do you have enough at home [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I have enough you know today but I don't have enough till the next time I come here.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  Well the issue is that we think that your uh blood pressure is actually dangerously high, uh at which point it seems as though based on your last blood work a year ago you have, uh the problem is is when people have kind of longstanding high blood pressures they uh, it can actually, it starts to damage other organs because the pressure's so high and the first organ damaged is usually the kidney.  Um based on your blood work which was April @@, [REDACTED]@, um your kidney function is less than 50%.  So that's fine, I mean people can live with 50% of their kidneys you know no problem but if it continues to decline and we don't get your blood pressure under control and this is why I’m so concerned about it today, once you get to about 10% that's when people need to go on dialysis.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: So you're halfway, more than halfway there to needing dialysis.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So it's just um, it's so important.  That's why it's so important and I want you to know dialysis is a miserable lifestyle.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: You have to go in two times a week.  You have to stay, it's nothing good about it – it’s bad.  Um and you know.
PATIENT: So hey I want to get this under control.
DOCTOR: So that's why, so that's why it's important to you know have, you know for us to talk now and um for you to get your blood pressure under control so we can preserve what you have left because there's no magic pill to regrow your kidneys.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: Just you know, technically just can't do it.  Um otherwise you know I think that should be the main issue uh for today.  Um.
PATIENT: I guarantee when I come back in here it'll be better.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  I mean it's not for me; it's for you you know.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well if you'll have a seat I'll take a quick listen to you.  I'd like for you to come back in two weeks.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: To make sure your blood pressure is at goal.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And uh I'll [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It fluctuates.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Sometimes it's high and sometimes it be low.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know.
PATIENT: Like it's always, sometimes it be [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah well, let's take a look.  Alright night deep breaths, deep breath, deep breath good.  Alright just breathe normal.  Alright.  Um uh let's see any swelling in the legs?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Good.  Now PATIENT uh how do you feel about weight loss?  Uh going to weight loss class?
PATIENT: I been [REDACTED].  I [REDACTED] lost twelve pounds since the last time I was in here.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  Let's see.
PATIENT: I'm doing it on my own.  I been losing weight, I lost 12 pounds.
DOCTOR: Right now, well that's good, that's good, that's good I'm really happy to see that.  It seems like you've been kind of bouncing up and down like the time before that you were 290, then you went up to 302 and now you're 291 today.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So you probably did, how tall are you?
PATIENT: 6 3.
DOCTOR: 6 3, so you should probably weigh about 225 so you could probably stand to lose about 50 pounds.
PATIENT: Wow.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah and uh you know it's referenced by um, you know the kind of burden it's taken on your body uh that we can see in some of your blood work.  Um you know I'm not here to lecture you.
PATIENT: Oh I know.
DOCTOR: I'm just, you know I'm trying to tell you what studies have shown and you know when you're here at the doctor's office we're gonna tell you what you know we know about the body that uh you know blood pressure control saves kidneys and we know based on how tall people are how much they're supposed to weigh and that preserving you know your cardiovascular functions.
PATIENT: I know.  You got to know where you're at.
