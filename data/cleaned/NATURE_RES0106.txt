DOCTOR: Mhmm.
PATIENT: And at that time I would have about 6 cigarettes a day, but then I like I, I knew that smoking wasn't good for me, so I'm trying to cut it down, but my friends still smoke, so sometimes when I go out with them, I'll just have a cigarette or two, maybe like once a month, I would say.

DOCTOR: OK.
PATIENT: It is an old building but it's been OK so far. No recent changes.
DOCTOR: OK, OK, good. So those were all the questions that I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?
PATIENT: No, I was just worried this cough isn't, isn't serious, right? You don't think I have Covid?
DOCTOR: So because your symptoms do overlap with that of Covid, we're going to get a swab on you done and you should get those results in about 24 to 48 hours. And if it's positive, public health will be in touch umm, to do some contact tracing. In the meantime, because you have a cough, it is recommended that you isolate for 14 days. And if it's not Covid, but it's probably something like acute bronchitis or some other viral infection that's going around at this time of year, so for that we can, you can just treat it with like supportive treatments. You know, like staying hydrated, uhm, good nutrition, good sleep and just keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse or really severe like you're having neurological symptoms and just seek help from the ER.
PATIENT: For sure. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Yeah, take care.
