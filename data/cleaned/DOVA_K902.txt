(DOCTOR OUT:  27:35  DOCTOR IN:  37:57)
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll do a couple of things.  We're going to start you on a new medication.
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: For your blood pressure and to help your heart rate too.  Um and we looked to try to see what could be causing this dry mouth and we think that the most likely cause is probably the loratadine medication.
PATIENT: For my sinus?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I think so too, I was gonna say can we change it back to Sudafed or Claritin.  I think [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well let's try you off of, cause those medications do that so let's try you off of it and see how you do.
PATIENT: And then I'm gonna be stopped up all night.
DOCTOR: We'll see though cause I mean if it's causing you this much pain, or this much you know trouble.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Let's just hold off on the medication right now.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um so that's one thing.  So this new medication I'm starting is called metoprolol.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay and it's for your blood pressure and for your heart rate okay.  And the other thing is I'm gonna treat you like you have an infection down there um and give you ciprofloxacin, that’s what you got the last time.
PATIENT: What is that, an antibiotic?
DOCTOR: An antibiotic.
PATIENT: Alright um it was like a [REDACTED] before that you know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I want to know if that's normal cause I don't think that's normal.
DOCTOR: Okay um it feels like it's inflamed.
PATIENT: Oh that just don't feel normal.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I ain't never [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I just wanted the doctors to see.  I don't think that's normal.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you want DOCTOR to come in?

DOCTOR: Sure I can have him come take a look just to make sure, would you feel more comfortable with that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: I'm not; if you want me to I can have him see you.
PATIENT: Well yeah, alright, thank you.  It hurts.
(DOCTOR OUT:  40:03  DOCTOR IN:  40:20)
DOCTOR: Hey.
PATIENT: Hey DOCTOR how you doing?
DOCTOR: What's going on?
PATIENT: I was [REDACTED].  The swelling is actually gone but I just worry here, maybe when you go holding that.
DOCTOR: I've got the magic touch?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, see if it's normal cause I don't think it’s normal doc.
DOCTOR: Oh well I don't think anybody here has called it normal.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: We think you've got epididymitis and we're gonna treat you with an antibiotic.
PATIENT: What is that?
DOCTOR: Epididymitis just means an infection where part of the scrotum is.
PATIENT: And this happens almost every two years like clockwork.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  Well, we’ll calm this down down, you know we could possibly have you seen by the prostate and the penis and the epididymis specialists.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: To see if there's anything we can do to prevent it from occurring again but.
PATIENT: But man it hurts, especially when I sit.
DOCTOR: And I get it.
PATIENT: Its back up [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And you're talking about?
PATIENT: I'm talking about this one.  It's like a [REDACTED] in there.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it don't feel like it's supposed to be in there doc.
DOCTOR: Let me know if I'm really hurting you, if I'm really hurting you.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Right up there?
PATIENT: Um no.
DOCTOR: It just right there.
PATIENT: You feel that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: All that anatomically it's all correct.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But you actually have the pain exactly where you have the inflammation in the epididymis.
PATIENT: Oh really.
DOCTOR: That's like a kind of string area that runs up right above your testicle.
PATIENT: I knew when I was here I had four balls, I mean four testicles.
DOCTOR: You had four testicles?  Good God.
PATIENT: And nobody believed me.  My mother thought I, how do you explain [REDACTED] watching you.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Weight lifts and one time [REDACTED] two balls and dropped two testicles, you actually have four testicles, did you know that?
DOCTOR: I didn't know that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think I would.
PATIENT: You got two up here and they would drop down so they cut me from here to here.  I don't know if they took it out or I was 17years old, but I was originally given four and as I get older I got more problems with my scrotum sac.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And is they supposed to hang that low?
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's normal.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah so we'll get you treated for that okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  So you say you got a guy that specializes in that?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You saw him last time.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: So we're giving you basically the same treatment.
PATIENT: Okay, so this is to dry it up or?
DOCTOR: Yeah, [REDACTED] uh it's like if you want to get some relief you could elevate them you know if you're sitting down you put a towel up under there, that'll give you some relief.  It'll take probably three, four days for the antibiotics to fully kick in.
PATIENT: I don't know, we'll see.
DOCTOR: Do you remember the last time they treated you for like a month right?
PATIENT: Actually they got me off work, I was in the hospital for two months when just one of them swole up, one of them balls swole up to the size of your own, this is [REDACTED] and the other swole up too and they was just humungous.  They put me in the hospital for two weeks for that.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna give you an antibiotics and you're gonna take it for four weeks so yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah, make sure you've got it long enough.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Okay.
PATIENT: So I can go back on my vitamins [REDACTED].  That I had a hernia but somehow they got the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Here's my idea about vitamins, they don’t really do much for you, but they don't hurt you.  If you feel better when you take them God bless you.
PATIENT: Oh really.
DOCTOR: Yeah so if you want them we'll give them to you.
PATIENT: Yes sir.
DOCTOR: Do you want the medications to be mailed to you or do you want to pick it up here?
DOCTOR: You want [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: The antibiotics here but the rest of them?
DOCTOR: Yeah here, but what about the rest of them.
PATIENT: That's fine I'll just wait, I can wait for it.  I don't pick up my daughter until 3:30 so I can wait.
