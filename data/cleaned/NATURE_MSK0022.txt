PATIENT: I'll have a glass of wine sometimes, but very rarely.
DOCTOR: OK. Um yeah, so those are just some of the questions I had for you now. I just wanted to ask a few questions regarding just physically examining the joints that hurt. So when you look at those joints, do you notice any kind of swelling, redness, or when you feel any warmth to them?
PATIENT: Yes I yeah I do. I feel swelling, warmth and redness.
DOCTOR: OK, and do you notice any kind of deformities, for example like you're not able to bend your finger or any kind of deformities that you didn't see before? Or, like, for example, your wrist is turned uh, outwards a little bit. Anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh, no, nothing like that, no deformity.
DOCTOR: No deformities. OK, when you go over your joints, do you notice any kind of like nodules or harder materials that don't seem to be your bones?
PATIENT: Not really, no. No, I don't notice anything like that. They just share a bit larger from the swelling it feels like.
DOCTOR: OK, I see. Are you able to make a fist with both both hands?
PATIENT: Not completely, I can close my hands part of the way, but I can't make a full fist.
DOCTOR: I see. OK and are you able to completely extend your fingers and show your palms?
PATIENT: Yeah I can do. I can do that.
DOCTOR: OK. And are you able to walk without a limp or anything like that?
PATIENT: Um, yes I can.
DOCTOR: OK. Alright, so those are just all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Um no, I'm just wondering what what this could be.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so from what you're describing to me you do fit into. The age range and all the symptoms are kind of point towards arthritis, and in this case it sounds more like rheumatoid arthritis. Ddefinitely it can be different types of arthritis that we will investigate just in case as well. But given that it's symmetrical, you have the morning stiffness that doesn't go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where those where the stiffness and pain is occurring itt sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis, especially since you've also, you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism, it's more likely to be another autoimmune condition. So what we will do is get a few tests done. This will involve some blood work as well. And we will also get some imaging done, so we will get like the CRP and ESR for inflammatory markers we will get like your full CBC blood count we will get rheumatoid factor test done as well as antinuclear antibody and a lot of other different just markers to rule out anything else besides rheumatoid arthritis and then we will also get just X-Rays of your hands and feet as well. So does that sound good?
PATIENT: It does, yeah, thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. And then if it does come out to be rheumatoid arthritis arthritis, which seems likely, you will need a referral to a rheumatologist to manage and treat your, uh, treat you with medications.
DOCTOR: OK, thank you alright, you're welcome. Take care.
