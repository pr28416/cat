DOCTOR: OK. OK, uhm and have any of them been sick or have they all been pretty healthy?
PATIENT: Uhm, in heard from anyone that's been sick. We we kind of have a rule that if you know if we feel sick then not to, not to show up just because, like you know, when we're when we're drinking and like smoking, we may share like a joint, so it's not like we don't want to get everyone sick if one person is sick.
DOCTOR: Yeah for sure. Uhm, that makes sense. Alright, any travel recently?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No, OK. And where do you live right now?
PATIENT: Right now I just live in an apartment by myself just outside of London.
DOCTOR: OK. Any old carpets, dust, mold, asbestos anything that could make your condition worse?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: OK, so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own for myself?
PATIENT: Uh no, I don't think so, I just wanted to see what this might be.
DOCTOR: Yeah, for sure. Uhm so, we are going to do a Covid swab on you because a lot of your symptoms do align with those of Covid, so we just want to rule that out first, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm, in the meantime you should isolate for two weeks and if it's not Covid, it could be another viral infection that's been going around this time of year. Either way, kind of management plan is the same, so make sure you're hydrated, eat well, sleep well, and if your symptoms become worse, severe or there any red flags like you have neurological symptoms, like seizures or weakness where you can move your limbs, you should seek help from the ER. How does that sound?
PATIENT: OK. That sounds good. Thank you.
DOCTOR: OK yeah, no problem.
