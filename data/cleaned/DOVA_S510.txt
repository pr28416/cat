DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The jet engine noise and then I was on the police department and sheriff's department here in Maywood.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So we're shooting gun range noise and then one day my tractor tire froze to the axel and I used a metal thing to try to hammer it out.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I was under a deck.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it created a lot of echoing and when I went in the house I was on the far side of the living room, the TV was on and I realized I could not understand the people talking on the TV.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So have you needed hearing aids?
PATIENT: And it didn't get better later.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When did you see Audiology last?
PATIENT: About a year and a half ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I had an hearing test done and they said it was the frequency.  I can hear deep frequency.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: But all the words are kind of different.  When high frequency enters the word sometimes then I miss it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How long have you had hearing loss?
PATIENT: Oh I probably had it without realizing for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But the actual, when I really did all that hammering.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know it was like probably the last straw for the eardrums.
DOCTOR: I'm going to get you to the Lab today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and we'll get electrolytes.  Just a standard blood count just so that we have it on file and then your diabetic test, your hemoglobin A1c and then I'll check your liver.  The cholesterol, did you eat lunch today?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Did you eat lunch?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No, okay you didn't.
PATIENT: No because I expected you might be sending to the Lab.
DOCTOR: Right.  Did you eat breakfast?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Good, okay let's do your cholesterol.
PATIENT: I had coffee this morning.
DOCTOR: That's okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we'll get your cholesterol.  I'll get your prostrate lab and some urine tests.  Okay.  And send you to Audiology for your hearing.  Have they talked with you about hearing aids before?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Have they ever talked to you about hearing aids before?
PATIENT: Oh when I had that first hearing test.
DOCTOR: Okay but then you said, it got better so they didn't want to do that and then I'll put in a referral for your um because you're due for a colonoscopy and actually a lot of these tests are the same [REDACTED].  But I'll check that one and this is for a colonoscopy.  This is a screening for colorectal cancer.  You have a prosthetic heart valve?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Any trouble with your heart valve?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No pacemaker or defibrillator?  You don't use oxygen?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No recent stroke or heart attack?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Okay.  No stents in your heart?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: And you're not on Plavix, Coumadin, Aggrenox.  You are on aspirin every day?  Are you on an aspirin every day?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and you're okay with having a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you ever been screened for an aneurysm in your aorta?
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay you smoked for a while and you have diabetes, high cholesterol, um your blood pressure looks okay but all of that together puts at higher risk for having an aneurysm of your aorta.  And an aneurysm is like, you know how you see bubble gum and you blow a bubble and if you blew a bubble, the bubble is a thin layer of gum compared to the rest of the gum that you're chewing in your mouth so the wall of your aorta pouches out like that and is very thin and it could rupture.  And so if it ruptures um, so what we do is we screen for it and if we see that you have one and it's a certain size, very little, we just watch it but if we see that it grows fast or that it's big then we refer you to a vascular surgeon so that they can fix it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So would you be interested in being screened for that knowing that if it's large then you'd have to go to surgery for it.  When they rupture 50% are fatal so that's why we screen for them, in males who have high risks and who smoked.  Would you like to elect for it, it's an ultrasound, it's an ultrasound.  Okay.  Okay, so we'll do that screening test too.  Alright.  Let me just um, standing you up here and I'll look at your feet.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You need an eye exam.  So I'll have you sit there and you can start with removing your socks and shoes.  Since you have smoked for 50 years, it's good to make sure that you don't have that.  Okay you can sit back.
PATIENT: Oh I did have one kind of surgery I forgot to mention.  What do they call it, um?
DOCTOR: A laminectomy?
PATIENT: When the thing bubbles out and pushes against the nerve bundle?
DOCTOR: Oh stenosis, spinal stenosis.
PATIENT: Yeah, the soft tissue in the spine?  Uh it herniated out.
DOCTOR: Oh a herniated disk.
PATIENT: Yes.  They did a laser discectomy on it.
DOCTOR: Oh when was that?
PATIENT: It was uh, it was maybe a year to a year and a half ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath, deep breath, deep breath okay.  You can breathe normally.  Hold your breath okay and breathe.  Okay and hold your breath again.  Okay.  Any belly pain?  Any chest pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] back pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do you take any um pain medications for chest pain?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications called nitrates?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any long acting?  How about medications, you've never had chest pain.  I'm sure you're not on any additional that you take when you have chest pain.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Nitroglycerin?
PATIENT: No, uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  Did you have Viagra before?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No, you've never tried it before okay?  So why do you think you need it now?
PATIENT: It ain't working.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Also because I heard on the net that it opens up blood cells and it might be a feet warner too.
DOCTOR: Okay what are you using for?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: You're using it for sexual activity right?  Viagra.
PATIENT: I would need it for that but.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: But it might open up blood cells around the feet a little bit so my feet feel a little warmer too.
DOCTOR: Hmm, well you wouldn't take it that often to do that.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: You wouldn't take it that often to see it affect long term like that.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Okay.
DOCTOR: If you were just taking it intermittently.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's not something that you would use every you know, every day like you use the metformin.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So.  This sensation here can you feel that?
PATIENT: Yep.
