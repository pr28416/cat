PATIENT: I see.
DOCTOR: We just like to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh yeah, okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.  Well why did they ask me to go, when was it Monday?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: What do you think that's about?  I don't know.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh they do a lot of things.
DOCTOR: I'll have to find out.  Yeah we [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I thought it wasn’t long.
DOCTOR: About a month ago.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: But you changed up some medications on me and stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure wasn't where we wanted it to be so we added this medication called [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um how have your blood pressures been since then?
PATIENT: Well doc you know it's improving.  It's improving.  She just checked it a little while ago so.  I think she said it was 127 or something like that.
DOCTOR: That is more than improving.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: That's more than improving.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah it's coming right along.  Uh I got a little something else to it.
DOCTOR: What's that?
PATIENT: Uh I been drinking garlic water.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: You heard of that?
DOCTOR: Uh I've heard of garlic water.
PATIENT: (Laughter).
DOCTOR: I don't know if it's really that true.
PATIENT: It’s one of those down-home remedies.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah so uh a buddy of mine was saying that you could take a little chopped up garlic and swallow all of it or what I've done was I've just taken chopped up some in a water bottle and I've been just swallowing that stuff in the morning and uh sometime in the evening before I go to bed.  It don't smell the best but it seem like it might helping though some.
DOCTOR: It's probably the medications.
PATIENT: (Laughter)  We put those together yes, yeah I didn't [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I wouldn't stop the medication.
PATIENT: Yeah I know, I know.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's just.
DOCTOR: You ended up going back to the PM&R people to complete your therapy.
PATIENT: For my leg?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Did you talk with them?
PATIENT: Uh well yeah.  What they suggested was that um I could just go for the workout system here.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.  They got a little [REDACTED].  I ain't found it yet.  Do you know where it is?
DOCTOR: Uh we can ask outside.  Actually I've never been to it.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: We put an order in so you're approved to get it.
PATIENT: Right, yeah, she put it all in the computer here.  But you see the thing is doc could you, I want to see the dentist you know for my teeth and what have you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh they said that I have to get it approved by the doctor.
DOCTOR: Yeah you have to have so it depends on what you need from the dentist.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: It's not that I have to approve anything.  I just put in the order to go to the dentist.  But I’ll tell you what the dentist offers here.  If you have a active infection of any of your teeth where you have like pus pouring out of your tooth they'll see you and take care of it.  If it's a chronic problem like cavities or bad teeth, they will pull your teeth out but they don't put anything in and they don't do the routine cleaning.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: The VA does not offer actual dental care.
PATIENT: Even if you didn't uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: If you're neglecting your teeth and you have infections then they'll say okay well we can deal with this.  I'll send you to the dentist but I'm pretty confident they're gonna tell you there's nothing going on, unless they can find something in your mouth that shows there's an active infection from your diabetes.
PATIENT: Yeah I'll tell you what's going on, I feel a knot right here in my gum.  It's been there a long, sometime.  As a matter of fact when I was working and I went to the dentist he was saying that there was like an infection and if I pulled the tooth out that the knot would go away.  But the tooth ain't bad.  He said it's not the tooth, it's the bottom of the tooth.  It's the gum.  If you pull the tooth out the knot will go away.  But I don't want to do that, [REDACTED] tooth.  You know he's twisting my arm.  I pulled the tooth out the knot is still there.  That's been a year or two years ago.
DOCTOR: So it's probably not infection if it's been there for two years.
PATIENT: Uh it don't hurt anything I just wondered you know why it was still there.  He said it was gonna go away.
DOCTOR: I don't know, I'm not a dentist.
PATIENT: (Laughter).
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: You ain't put [REDACTED] or not.
DOCTOR: When did you start getting the dizziness?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: When did you start getting dizzy?
PATIENT: Doc I'm gonna tell you ever since I been taking, start insulin, always sometimes having to be off balanced like uh feeling, they say that's part of the territory being a diabetic.
DOCTOR: No I mean, give me a time like an actual.  When did you start having the dizziness?  Like a year ago, six months ago, three or four years ago.  When were you started on insulin?  I don't know these details.
PATIENT: Okay I been on insulin for over 30, 32 to 33 years.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So, insulin gives you dizziness if your blood sugar is low.  So if you give yourself your insulin shot and your blood sugar goes to 50, then we.
PATIENT: It's not just dizzy; it felt like an off balance at time.  Like if you go around too quick.
DOCTOR: That won't be from the insulin.  It could be, if the diabetes affected your nerves.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause that happens to people over the years.
PATIENT: Okay I'm tending to believe cause I do have neuropathy.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: In my feet too.
DOCTOR: There's the nerves in your legs, there's another kind of nervous system in the body called the autonomic nervous system.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: What that does it like when you stand up.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's the nerves that cause the veins to constrict to get your blood back up to the body so you don't get dizzy and lightheaded and those will get damaged over the years from diabetes.
PATIENT: Oh, [REDACTED] okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I gotcha, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um that's another type of nerve damage.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That's a little bit tougher to treat you know.  It doesn't work like you know [REDACTED] gabapentin for neuropathy and that helps.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But there's not too many good ways to treat that.
PATIENT: I see.
DOCTOR: Other than get the glucose controlled.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: How have your blood sugars been?
PATIENT: Oh it's coming along pretty good.
DOCTOR: How is, what’s pretty good?  Remember everyone has different ideas of pretty good.
PATIENT: I know doc, it's just that, it's down.  I'll put it that way in the morning time, sometimes like 200 uh sometimes uh like 150; it depends on what I eat that night.  I know it should be around 120 or 100.
DOCTOR: Yeah you know better.
PATIENT: Ah doc, you know what I'm trying to say.  Trying to control this sometimes is almost like trying to walk, I feel like I could walk a tightrope better than I can try to get this down you know.  It's just, but it's up to me, you got to do it on your own.  All you can do is tell me what to do and give me some [REDACTED], the rest is up to me.
DOCTOR: That's true.  What's holding you back?
PATIENT: My back?
DOCTOR: No what's holding you back from having good control of your blood sugars?
PATIENT: Oh just uh the temptation.  You might say the temptation you know uh.  It's just the temptations I guess, it's like the world and the shape that it's in today.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: All these holidays.  You got especially cake laying all over the table and it's hard to just walk by it and just don't get a little bitty piece.  You can do it cause you're a doctor right?
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: (Laughter).
DOCTOR: No I have the same problem.
PATIENT: You got that problem too huh.
DOCTOR: Um, so what if we just try to go up on the insulin a little bit?  Just so [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah, but you know what, I wasn't allowed to go up any more you know but I'll probably come down on the eating.
DOCTOR: Alright [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: As long as you understand and you have a plan.
PATIENT: That's where the problem is.  You know if you go up on the insulin, you’re gonna say, “Nah, I’m on top of it” and then I'm just gonna start eating more.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So if.
PATIENT: Do you know what I'm saying?
DOCTOR: I know what you're saying.  Just as long as you understand.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I gotcha.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I just have to stop putting too much food or overeating in my mouth, that's just what it is.
DOCTOR: I want to make sure you've got [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I do these uh, [REDACTED] yeah I know I.
DOCTOR: Do you take your vitamin D pill, it's the one with?
PATIENT: Yes.  I haven't taken them all yet, but I've been taking one every Monday.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um I think I've got about three or four more.
DOCTOR: Yeah that should be right.  Just take them till you run out and when you run out let me know and we'll recheck your levels.
PATIENT: Okay.  But uh I'm on my last bottle of the insulin.
DOCTOR: Um.  (Someone comes to the door)  [REDACTED] needs to be ordered then but your insulin you have ten refills on one of them.
PATIENT: On refills?
DOCTOR: And 11 on the other.  I think we're okay there but you just have to go pick them up.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No new orders.
PATIENT: Okay so I can go over there and request.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: How about the one [REDACTED] pill, the last one she gave me it seems like I'm getting a little low.  I don't know if I've got any around the house that I've lost or uh how much do.
DOCTOR: They're all available now.  There's like two or three refills for each one so.
PATIENT: But does it indicate that I need to [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Yeah it does.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: They give you a nine month's supply.
PATIENT: Nine months?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh it's just that I, okay.
DOCTOR: You just have to get the refills.
PATIENT: Just got to refill them.
DOCTOR: So yeah it shouldn't be a problem okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: (Someone comes to the door)  Sorry PATIENT they needed directions.
PATIENT: That's no problem; you know I know how it is.
DOCTOR: So yeah the new one we gave you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I gave you a 90 day supply so that's three months.
PATIENT: Yeah because you told me to take one and then you upped it to take one in the morning and one in the evening.
DOCTOR: Right.  That was back in the first of November or.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: There was 90 pills given.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: At that time so.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That should last you three months and then you have two refills from there.
PATIENT: That should last for how long?
DOCTOR: 90 pills.
PATIENT: Should last for.
DOCTOR: You're taking half a tablet in the morning, half in the afternoon.
PATIENT: No I'm taking a whole.
DOCTOR: You're taking a whole?
PATIENT: You switched it to a whole one; somebody did to a whole one in the morning and a whole one in the evening.
DOCTOR: Oh okay well then.
PATIENT: Did you see who ordered it?
DOCTOR: They didn't change the order.
PATIENT: Maybe you could change that.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll change that so that they.
PATIENT: Yeah.  You know I don't want to get mixed up because one doctor says one thing and one doctor changes it back again.
DOCTOR: No, no, I'm glad you did, I gotcha.  I'm glad you brought that in.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh the renal doctor did.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The kidney doctor okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  So then let's watch it, looks like that supply is getting a little low huh.
DOCTOR: That's fine I'll refill it, no problem.
PATIENT: Is it okay with you?
DOCTOR: Yeah of course.
PATIENT: I mean to up the dose.
DOCTOR: Yeah well you can go as high as we need to get your blood pressure under control.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: When you saw the kidney doctors your blood pressure is wasn’t good.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: They look at the decision where.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But it's like you said you know it's up to you.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: If we don't control your blood pressure, if we don't control your diabetes.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You will be on dialysis.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: If you live long enough to get there.  You want to be dialysis?
PATIENT: No.  Is that what ya'll want?
DOCTOR: Of course not.
PATIENT: Me either.
DOCTOR: So if somebody tells me to take the higher dose of medication, I'm okay with it and you should be with it too if it means your blood pressure goes lower and you're 120/70 is where your blood pressure is now.  That's where you should be being that you have diabetes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If it's ever above that, every day it's above that you're hurting your kidneys.  Same thing with the blood sugars.  So you got to really start working on the eating.  If you don't want to go up on your insulin and I'll respect your wishes then you've got to get with it with the food.
PATIENT: You're right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  If you're gonna eat all of.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I need to kick you in the pants sometimes though.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  You only doing your job by telling me what to do.  It's up to me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely.  Do you have any questions or anything right now?
PATIENT: Yeah can you [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: In your what?
PATIENT: In my ears.
DOCTOR: In your ears, yeah what's going on with your ears?
PATIENT: I still got this ringing in my ears.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah sorry the ringing.  Uh when did that start?
PATIENT: Oh it's going when I started taking these last pills, the blood pressure pills that you gave me.  I'm thinking it might come from that.  Is that possible?  That you can get a ringing in the ear?  I mean basically it's in this ear and sometimes you know it'll clog up sometimes.  Maybe it's [REDACTED] I don't know.
DOCTOR: I'll take a look.  This is not a medication that usually causes ringing in the ear.
PATIENT: Okay.  No medications do that.
DOCTOR: No a lot of medications can.  The one you're on doesn't.
PATIENT: Oh it doesn't.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And to be honest with you, if you said, it might be part of the reason that it was the ringing in the ears, [REDACTED] with the blood pressure.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Sometimes it's in your best interest just to deal with it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Cause it's keeping your blood pressure in a good place and we don't have any other blood pressure medications to give you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You're on everything else already.  So we'll take a look and see.  Do you clean your ears regularly?
PATIENT: Um maybe once a week.
DOCTOR: What do you use to clean them?
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: What do you use to clean them?
PATIENT: Basically just the end of the towel, something like that you know.  Sometimes I don't feel, I think it's just the right ear.  When I put [REDACTED] the first time I went in on this side and when I get it’s stopped up.
DOCTOR: So this is a good thing, if it's only one ear it's not the symptoms of the blood pressure medication.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: This oh okay I can tell you right now, I can't see into it.
PATIENT: What's up?
DOCTOR: It's covered in wax all the way.
PATIENT: Yeah, is that right?
DOCTOR: Yeah like I can't even, look, so here...
PATIENT: Well my wife has said why don't you get the doctor to look in your ears and see what's wrong, you can't hear nothing.
DOCTOR: You can't even see into it.
PATIENT: Both of them?
DOCTOR: This one, this is the one that's totally clogged all the way.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll give you some drops to get ride of it.
PATIENT: Okay.  Sounds good.
DOCTOR: Um.  Have a seat here.
PATIENT: Does fish, baked fish a good source of meet for you?
DOCTOR: Yeah baked fish.  Baked fish or grilled fish.  Fried fish is not.
PATIENT: Cause I'm trying to, I've been eating it for the last week or so and man I mean, my sugars are all the way down when I eat fish.
DOCTOR: Your sugar is good.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Are they good [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah it works real good but it's just you know you get tired of just eating baked fish and eat something else.  Could be [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I ordered those drops we talked about and look at those teeth, okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just lay back.  [REDACTED] pharmacy you can pick up the ear drops and there's instructions on them on how to use them but basically you put the ear drop in, you let it sit there while it dissolves the wax.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Turn the head over and let it drain out.  You don't put anything in there to scrape it out.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Or remove it yourself okay.
PATIENT: Just let the drop and let it dissolve in there, right?
DOCTOR: Yes.  Open your mouth, stick your tongue out.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: This thing?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: How long has that been there?
PATIENT: Too long, couple of years.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to see the dentist, you need to see the maxillofacial people it looks like something for the oral surgeons.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We can have you see them and have them look at this.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um.  I'm thinking [REDACTED] diabetes, you know [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's a large growth in your mouth.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Deep breath.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah you know I'm kind of confused what that is myself.  When you were describing it I thought it was gonna be a small bump.  It's definitely not infection.  It's a large growth of tissue there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we'll have the facial, the oral facial surgeon who specialize in the jaws.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And the bones of the face, we'll have them take a look at it to see if they could do a biopsy and figure out what it is.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: How long has it been there?
PATIENT: I'd say two years or more.
DOCTOR: Does it get bigger or is it staying the same size?
PATIENT: Hmm it might be a little bit bigger but it doesn't seem to get any smaller.
DOCTOR: Are you a smoker?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Did you smoke when you were younger?
PATIENT: Um yeah when I was, like 20s or something like that.
DOCTOR: How long did you smoke for?
PATIENT: Oh I guess about, off and on, I guess about five, six years.
DOCTOR: Let me go tell my boss what we're doing today.  Basically we're gonna do the drops.
PATIENT: Okay.

PATIENT: Okay.

DOCTOR: Okay.  I talked to my boss; he's okay with that plan.  You can take that and show it to the clerk and she will give you an appointment to see Oral Surgery or they'll send an appointment in the mail to you.  The next time I'm going to see you it'll be two months [REDACTED].
