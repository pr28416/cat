DOCTOR: Celebrex huh.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You're not taking that here?

DOCTOR: Is it arthritis pain or just.
PATIENT: Well it must, it must be.
DOCTOR: Is it a new kind of pain?
PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: Is it a new kind of pain or just like before?
PATIENT: I used to take it occasionally, I mean I would take Aleve before I'd play golf and it would help.
DOCTOR: It would help?
PATIENT: And now I haven't taken any Aleve since I take the Celebrex.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So it has to, my shoulder and my back it must be and I do see a chiropractor.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: On a regular basis, every six to eight weeks and so I wanted to find out about that and you know a lot of times my blood pressure's still high and it probably, let's see today it was like 140 I think and uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And in the afternoons my ankles have been swollen up.
DOCTOR: Are you on your ankle, are you on your feet every day or?
PATIENT: I walk.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I walk every morning about a mile and a half.
DOCTOR: Is it worse at the end of the day?
PATIENT: I play golf.  I'm on my feet a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you, have you tried elevating them?
PATIENT: I put my feet up in the evenings and it.
DOCTOR: So does it help?

DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  Any numbness, any tingling, any weakness in the legs?
PATIENT: No.

DOCTOR: Metoprolol.
PATIENT: Yeah, yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah so.
PATIENT: Along with the simvastatin.

DOCTOR: Oh you still have refills on it.  Have you been calling them and ask them to. (Someone knocks on the door and the doctor visits with another person for a few minutes)  Sorry about that sir.
PATIENT: Oh that's no problem.  Um so the lisinopril I probably should be taking that and I don't.
DOCTOR: Yeah, right, right.
PATIENT: I don't even know what it looks like.
DOCTOR: Oh.  Okay it looks like you have two refills left so it must have been that when you called them to ask them to ship your, maybe you didn't ask for that.
PATIENT: Uh some of them they automatically come.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And then if I running low and I'm gonna go out of town or something I call and order it.

PATIENT: I don't have heartburn ever since I started taking a pill.
DOCTOR: Omeprazole?  Great.
PATIENT: Well I take uh; I started off with actually years and years and years ago when it first came out, the Prilosec.
DOCTOR: Yeah.

PATIENT: No night sweats or anything, no nothing.
DOCTOR: Nausea, no vomiting, no belly pain?
PATIENT: No.  I just, I'm still concerned about my blood pressure though because like I take it at home.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I have a machine.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: This morning I took it, it was 140 something over 66.
DOCTOR: So you didn't take your meds yet right?
PATIENT: No I hadn't taken any meds but I took it this morning just to compare with what would happen here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know it's 139/70.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh you know.
DOCTOR: That's, that's borderline.  You don't have heart disease, you don't have diabetes right?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So what's the goal for you.  The goal for you is to be less than 140/80.  You're borderline.
PATIENT: Yeah I want to be.
DOCTOR: Right so I would rather you be in the 130s.
PATIENT: So would I.
DOCTOR: So the fact that you didn't take your medicine today.
PATIENT: Yeah but.
DOCTOR: And if that's the.
PATIENT: I don't usually take my blood pressure early.  I usually take it in the afternoon.
DOCTOR: Right, right and the fact that you haven't been taking the lisinopril, cause the lisinopril will drop your blood pressure too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that could be the reason.
PATIENT: When should I take, when should I take the lisinopril?
DOCTOR: In the morning, take it in the morning.
PATIENT: With the other pill too?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Take the lisinopril and if you feel lightheaded or dizzy check your blood pressure and if it's too low like too low.
PATIENT: But it'll never be low.
DOCTOR: Less than 100s then you can call me and I'll have you come back in about two weeks okay uh for blood pressure checks and we'll see where we are.
PATIENT: Uh can I do that on the 19th?
DOCTOR: Sure.  Do you have an appointment then?
PATIENT: Cause I have an appointment with the dermatologist.
DOCTOR: Why don't you, fine.  You come on the 19th uh for a blood pressure check and then get your labs too.  I want to check one more thing.  I know you had it this morning.  Your cholesterol was fine.
PATIENT: Everything's fine?  Blood sugar.
DOCTOR: Your cholesterol was fine.  Your blood sugar is okay.  The only thing is I need to know your BNP, your kidney function and everything which was not checked today.  So you'll come back the 19th, you'll get lab draws.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Now do you see a primary care doctor on the outside too or is it just the chiropractor?

DOCTOR: Alright.  Go ahead and sit up.  Your strength is pretty good?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: You said you have back pain huh and your hips?
PATIENT: Well I had some pain, every once.  I got hurt when I was a kid and I got uh, um, so I go to the chiropractor uh quite often.
DOCTOR: Does it help?
PATIENT: And I think it's getting a little arthritic.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I was trying to um keep my golf game going.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then I uh and I got uh to where I've had to take Aleve.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh I scratched a thing there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: There was a little spot there and I was sitting here and I scratched it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, go ahead and sit up.
PATIENT: So I did the um so I, my wife said why don't you try one of my Celebrex.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I took.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I took it for two days.
DOCTOR: And it really helped you?
PATIENT: And it helped so then I thought well, so I went off.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then it came back.
DOCTOR: Yeah right.
PATIENT: And then I took it again and it went away.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we have the hip pain right here, where is it?
PATIENT: It's back in here, back here, right about in here.
DOCTOR: Okay alright.  Does it go anywhere or does it stay there?
PATIENT: It stays there.
DOCTOR: Okay.  No numbness, no tingling in the legs?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No pain traveling down your legs?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No weight loss?
PATIENT: Well you know I used to drive a lot when I was in uh when I was working.  I had, I worked a lot in the car.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So my leg would get sore.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I, this might all be related you know but uh when I gave up my sales, I had to drive for sales and when I stopped doing that it kind of went away.
DOCTOR: Okay.  No bowel, no bladder incontinence like trouble, no nothing like that.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No um kind of numbness in the genital area, nothing like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: No I'm good.
DOCTOR: Okay alright.  So it's the same kind of pain that you've had for years but it's just like you were taking Aleve.
PATIENT: I was taking Aleve or um Advil.
DOCTOR: But [REDACTED] more.
PATIENT: That kind of stuff and.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Now I haven't been taking any Aleve, no Advil.
DOCTOR: Have you, have you been checking um or has anyone gotten like an x-ray of that area?
PATIENT: Well my chiropractor.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah cause he works on it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think it's something that uh um when I was a kid I had a bout with some railroad ties, lifting railroad ties and that part of my back went out.
DOCTOR: Umm okay.
PATIENT: And every once in a while if I turn the wrong way I can hurt it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean it's just like if you're off balance and you lean some way, you know and it goes right back to that same spot.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I think that because of all this, it's probably become arthritic.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: So you think the uh, this lisinopril or whatever might, might help the swelling down too?
DOCTOR: The what, the lisinopril?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: No, no.
PATIENT: What's causing the swelling in the ankles?
DOCTOR: You know um I don't, I mean.  Sometimes one of your medicines can, the nifedipine can do it, nifedipine might do it.
PATIENT: It just seems like it didn't start for uh till about I don't know.
DOCTOR: It's new.
PATIENT: Last December or January.
DOCTOR: You know it should not, I don't know, it shouldn't.

DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um, um so one thing is um, I'll send you the lisinopril.  Unfortunately I was asking one of the doctors who's worked here for a longer time than I did.  I am um; they say that Celebrex we have to get special approval because it's expensive and you know how.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Especially at the VA.  So let me, let me try to get that for you okay.  I can put in a consult through the system.  They'll review it and they'll let me know if you can get it for you.  Some patients are on it, I can make sure that you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: In your case it's indicated which I think it is, but I'll let you know but if not you can always ask your outside doctor to prescribe it for you too.  But I'll let you know though.
PATIENT: Yeah I'd rather get it through.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: The VA because its.
DOCTOR: Yeah let me, let me work on that for you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I want to get you and come back on the 19th for a blood pressure check okay.

DOCTOR: I can get yeah; I'll check liver function at that time too.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna do, this is June 19th okay.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: I'll put in the labs and then you can see me in six months.  Obviously if you [REDACTED] need to.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then.
PATIENT: So what I shouldn't worry about my ankles then unless they've started getting numb or something?
DOCTOR: Yeah if you start, again if you start, if you start to feel that you know propping them up isn't helping as much or if you have any numbness or tingling and you think it's getting bigger, call me and let me know.  I think it's a little bit of that medicine that you're on.  Nifedipine, it can give you a little bit of swelling so.
PATIENT: The one I take after lunch?
DOCTOR: I just don't know which one, nifedipine that's the and uh.
PATIENT: It's uh yeah it's uh.
DOCTOR: The calcium channel blocker.
PATIENT: Yeah I have the.
DOCTOR: So let me, I mean let me know, I mean since the medicine is working for you let's continue it but if it's getting to the point where it's getting worse and you want to switch medicines, then we can do that too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I mean um you know they, I was only taking a half dose of the nifedipine.
DOCTOR: Nifedipine 60 mg.
PATIENT: Yeah and now they doubled that.
DOCTOR: 60?
PATIENT: Yeah to 60.  It was 30.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they went to.
DOCTOR: That might have been why.
PATIENT: Maybe that's when it started.
DOCTOR: Well we can maybe, well did I do that?  I doubled it to 60 right when you saw me?
PATIENT: Yeah I saw the uh, your assistant, what's the name?
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: The young lady.
DOCTOR: NAME?
PATIENT: NAME.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah NAME yeah.  I saw her and one time after I saw you and then.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I told her, they said my blood pressure is still too high so they doubled it.  Maybe that's when that started, I'm not.
DOCTOR: I think yeah it might have been, so let's take the lisinopril.  If the lisinopril is controlling your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Then we'll go easy on the nifedipine, how's that?
PATIENT: It's a deal.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Lab on the 19th okay?
