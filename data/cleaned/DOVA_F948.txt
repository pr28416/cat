PATIENT: I know it is, you know I knew [REDACTED] my eyes is nothing, my nerves [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah it's because you're not taking your water pills.  You're full of fluid.

DOCTOR: You have a tendency because your liver doesn't, isn't 100% you know.

DOCTOR: And I know you don't want to take it.
PATIENT: I keep saying, the same thing@.  But I've been so busy trying to like just get through the day, I tend of forget about it, just focus on the now with what I have to get done.  If I have to get a letter out, pay a bill or whatever.  The first of the month I go prepare things, go to the bank get the money, go to Cashay, get the money orders and then get around to pay the people.  Uh, so I'm just so focused doing that, if it's not an emergency I usually have a tendency not to put that high on the priority list.
DOCTOR: Let me see, okay here's your liver doctor.  I want to see what your liver doctor says.
PATIENT: He said he didn’t want to put me back on interferon.
DOCTOR: He said he wanted to?

PATIENT: I'm with this program, CWT Program here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they are considering me working.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay.
PATIENT: Is that, am I physically able to work?
DOCTOR: If you're getting Home Health, I don't know if that's a good idea, you know what I mean?

DOCTOR: If I fill out all these papers saying that you need.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: Uh disabled.
PATIENT: Okay ma'am, no problem.  I really want that.
DOCTOR: I'd get help when you need to.  Are you low on money?
PATIENT: No, no, it's just that I'm tired of just being in the house.
DOCTOR: Oh, okay.
PATIENT: All the time, was just for a while.
DOCTOR: Oh volunteering?
PATIENT: Well, well.
DOCTOR: What type of work are we talking about?
PATIENT: It's just scanning documents into a computer.
DOCTOR: Why don't you just go volunteer?
PATIENT: Well cause they're planning to do more volunteering than I do there and when I get no salary.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that’s true.  The VA [REDACTED] takes good care of you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right, well I get a special compensation cause I got two, I got two 100s really for the stroke and for the PTSD but it's just that I just want to do something with my life.  I'm not doing nothing just sitting and looking at the TV all day.
DOCTOR: Do you think uh, do you think volunteering would be more fruitful for you cause, cause volunteerism is a little bit more like you know you're donating your time.
PATIENT: I know but, but from what I understand the job description, I'm not, I would probably be doing less than if I volunteered.
DOCTOR: And they need a note from me?
PATIENT: No, no I was just asking your professional opinion.
DOCTOR: Well the thing is if you, you know if you feel that physically you're able to do it, I encourage you, you know, to be more active in your life and happy if you want to do it.
PATIENT: Right, well uh.
DOCTOR: But, like I don't want you to go and then be limited to be there, you know kind of fall backwards.
PATIENT: Well they, first my psychiatrist referred me to the program.
DOCTOR: Oh good, okay.
PATIENT: And and so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Then he signed off on it.
DOCTOR: But again you know, if you're having a hard time taking care of yourself around the house, I, I wonder how um, well you'll do this job, you know what I mean?
PATIENT: Yeah, right.
DOCTOR: You could try it.
PATIENT: Well we'll see, all, all the state could do is actually like, if somebody come out there, they don't do no vital signs or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Or anything medical, they just want us come there and.
DOCTOR: Help you around the house.
PATIENT: Yes, I mean like go to the store for me.
DOCTOR: Why don't you try it out and if you seem to struggle with it, you know, you know yourself.
PATIENT: Right, okay.  Right, yeah okay, I think I could do it.
DOCTOR: But to be honest with you, I'd rather you concentrate on your medicines.
PATIENT: Okay, you're right.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright doc.
DOCTOR: Let me put in the bone scan.  You can go ahead and, do you need help getting out?
PATIENT: No I'm okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm gonna put in the bone scan and then.
PATIENT: So I just tell them at the check-out?
DOCTOR: Yes, yep, exactly.
PATIENT: Do want to give this form, this paperwork you gave me?
DOCTOR: That's in the folder book.
PATIENT: And then I can go pick up my meds sometime today?
DOCTOR: Yep, that's right.  Thanks for remembering.
PATIENT: Okay doc, okay then I'll see you in three months.
