DOCTOR: So what brings you in?
PATIENT: OK, I'm so I have been coughing a lot over the past week or so. And it's been pretty dry, but I've been coughing like almost nonstop throughout the day, and I'm feeling very short of breath, and my bronchodilator helps, but I found I'm using it a lot now.
DOCTOR: OK, how long have you know that you have asthma for?
PATIENT: I was diagnosed when I was eight.
DOCTOR: You're 10 now.
PATIENT: That's right.
