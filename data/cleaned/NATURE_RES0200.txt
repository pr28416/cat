DOCTOR: Just your father OK. How much do you smoke?
PATIENT: Probably half a pack a day. It used to be one pack, even 2 packs at one point in time, but right now it's half the packaging.
DOCTOR: OK, alright, well, it's good that you're cutting down. And if you need more resources to help you do that, we have some available that we can refer you to. Do you take any other recreational drugs like cannabis, heroin, cocaine?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that, no.
DOCTOR: OK. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Um just probably maybe like a couple times a month.
DOCTOR: Couple times a month OK. And are you currently married?
PATIENT: Yeah, I currently live with my sorry, wife, in an apartment.
DOCTOR: OK, and any reason for you to believe you have old carpets, mold, dust, asbestos, pets, anything that could be triggering your symptoms?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. We live in like a fairly new apartment.
DOCTOR: OK, OK, good, and have you been in contact with any sick people recently?
PATIENT: No, not not really. Wie’ve been just to ourselves.
DOCTOR: OK, and have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, just been on our house.
DOCTOR: OK. Alright, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions of your own?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah I was just wondering what this can be.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you know it sounds like you have a cough and shortness of breath, and both of these things you've had for a while, but now they're getting worse and based on your past history of COPD I would say this sounds like a COPD exacerbation. So for that we will start off with some basic blood work like CBC, electrolytes, your kidney function, ABG’s, as well as like a chest X Ray. And basically we should treat it we're going to take your oxygen saturation an give you some extra oxygen if you need. We’ll continue to use your bronchodilators an and in addition to both of that will also give you some steroids as well as antibiotics. And just to prevent any infections or if you already have it then it can help with that as well. And because your symptoms somewhat overlap with those of Covid will also do a covid swab just to make sure it's not that. And you should hear back about those results in 24 to 48 hours. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good. Thank you.
DOCTOR: OK, yeah, no problem.
