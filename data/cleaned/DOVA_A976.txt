PATIENT: I listen to some of these guys over there, these obese guys over there and when they say 2000 calories a day and one guy says you mean I can have 2000 calories a meal and they say no it's 2000 for the whole day.  It was funny to listen to some of these guys.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: How they can't quit smoking and how they can't quit this and you know when they talk about the portion size like and they're like there's no way I can survive on that and you can, you can technically survive on that.  It's just that getting I think the body shrunk down a little bit.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED]You can do it with the MOVE program.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

PATIENT: Another thing too uh, I had surgery.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I had surgery December on the left knee.
DOCTOR: Where was that?
PATIENT: Elk Grove Village. Barrington Orthopedics Surgery.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That was an ACL tear.
DOCTOR: Well how did that happen?
PATIENT: Well to be honest, we drove out to Iowa for Thanksgiving, drove back was great, got out of the truck was great, went to sleep was great, woke up the next morning and I couldn't walk.  I guess it tore in a couple of spots [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Fantastic.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But there for a while I was getting problem, except a [REDACTED] fluid was building up and they went up and drained it, the orthopedists drained it twice right.  Uh I also [REDACTED] went and ran a test on it so they recommend me to a pain therapist.
DOCTOR: Okay so you're doing that with Elk Grove Village?
PATIENT: Uh yeah.
DOCTOR: What hospital is that?
PATIENT: Alexian Brothers.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So is that where you're doing physical therapy?
PATIENT: Right, I finished physical therapy [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: Uh so they sent me to a pain [REDACTED] building up the fluid and they are at 455 South Roselle Road, I remember the pain specialist and they took the fluid out and they sent it out and found out it was very high in uric acid.
DOCTOR: Oh okay so.
PATIENT: So they recommended pills for me, [REDACTED], 0.6 twice a day.
DOCTOR: Is it colchicine?
PATIENT: Yeah them little purple pills?
DOCTOR: Yeah colchicine.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  I don’t know why [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That was what was on the bottle.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Okay.  [REDACTED].  Did they say you had gout?
PATIENT: Yeah, well that acid was so high and it was not leaving, so the gout was there so.
DOCTOR: So okay, so you're on colchicine and how is your leg now?
PATIENT: Fantastic.  Never felt better.
DOCTOR: You said that was 0.6 mg tablet.
PATIENT: Yes, yeah, twice a day.  If [REDACTED] can I get that prescription through the VA?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I just want to make sure it's the right medication though.
PATIENT: It's a little purple pill.
DOCTOR: I think it is yeah.  It's called Colcar, it's actually the same thing as colchicine.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So then after that went, the only reason I went back was for them to take blood out, check blood and I was very deficient on vitamin D.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So they started me on vitamin D 2000 per day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then once a week another one at 50,000.
DOCTOR: Okay yeah, yeah, yeah.  So vitamin D, you’re taking what?
PATIENT: 2000 per day.
DOCTOR: Yeah and then the shot.
PATIENT: And then once a week and I usually take it on Friday 50,000.
DOCTOR: And do you okay.  Do you have [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: I don't think so.  They said even being out in the sun I would not get enough vitamin D to bring it down.
DOCTOR: Do you have like a lab value of your low vitamin D?
PATIENT: I don't have it with me here.  I can get it from them.
DOCTOR: You need this vitamin D cause I would not have checked the vitamin D level before giving you this.
PATIENT: They did over there, it was way down, but I don't remember where it was.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright um.
PATIENT: It was very low.
DOCTOR: Do you get it from the VA?
PATIENT: If I can. [REDACTED] refills.  [REDACTED] to do the blood work before the appointment so I did it on the 10th.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: The only I asked them, at that time, about doing the urethra test, the acid test.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I got a copy of it yesterday and I didn't see it on there.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And I asked them because that's when they found out that that.
DOCTOR: Did you call, did I tell you?  They tell me so I have to put the order in.
PATIENT: Okay so talk to NAME the nurse.
DOCTOR: I need to be the one to order it okay.
PATIENT: She said oh no problem we'll have it put on there.  I still fast today so if you want to take more blood today you can.  For the vitamin D [REDACTED].  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You know, if you're [REDACTED] and you're not having any symptoms right now I don't think, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause I mean if you're having like active infection or if you're actually having pain then we'll get it.
PATIENT: Okay well, whatever was in that pill; I don't think I always thought it was old age.  [REDACTED] but I guess [REDACTED] gout is and I feel ambitious, you know it's like oh my God, what's in that pill that makes me feel so good and I know it's an expensive pill and I didn't know if I could get that through the VA or not.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The other joints, they hurt a little bit but then it’s old age creeping in [REDACTED] not a problem you know.  And they went back and says no, they called up right away and said you could see the crystals in the urine right there, like you have a very high [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright so let's see.

PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay maybe that was the one that [REDACTED]brought the dose down, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Why did they bring it down?  So you were on 80 right?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I think I missed some refills for some reason, I went to bed and I got back up and said did I take that medication or not.  [REDACTED]. That little bit, let’s start you at 20 again.
DOCTOR: So how much - were you taking 20 at home?

DOCTOR: Okay.  So we're going to go up on this.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause your cholesterol level is high.  [REDACTED].  Are still only taking half pills right?
PATIENT: Yes, yes I got that one because those were [REDACTED].  And I know they cut the dose down on that one.  I take those pills [REDACTED] at night cause that's recommended to take at night, bedtime, for nighttime, 9:00, I always take it before I go to bed.
DOCTOR: Um, it shouldn't matter.
PATIENT: It doesn't matter if you take it earlier in the day?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] right?

DOCTOR: So [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And [REDACTED] medications.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So your simvastatin and on one pill.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] recommended 1000, 1000 ISP and [REDACTED] fluid again but it felt like I had a rash or something so drinking big bottles of water a day.  The 500 has been fine.
DOCTOR: So you um, do you have any cardiovascular disease, heart disease at all?
PATIENT: I'm not sure.  I went to [REDACTED] wife cause she's [REDACTED] going to be setting up an appointment.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] angiogram or anything before?
PATIENT: Not yet.
DOCTOR: Okay and you're not diabetic right?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um do you smoke?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: You have high blood pressure right?
PATIENT: High blood pressure.  I got 130 over something.
DOCTOR: Yeah but you're on medication for that.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: So what was the next thing, [REDACTED].  DOCTOR had me take [REDACTED]. She’s afraid I’ll kick the bucket.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: To make sure [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: 67.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]
PATIENT: The pneumonia shot, the booster [REDACTED] she wants to know.
DOCTOR: Did you get it before?
PATIENT: I think you got to know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] on the record.  [REDACTED] booster.
DOCTOR: I don't know [REDACTED].  Let me know if, we'll go through it [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay, okay.  Somewhere in there [REDACTED] red flag records.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Check that and see what the doctor [REDACTED] to give me the shot or not.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Okay, so your HDL, your good cholesterol has come down a little bit, it’s 29 and it should be around 40 okay, so it needs to be higher.
PATIENT: But it's coming down and not going up.
DOCTOR: Yeah and lipids should be going up cause we know it sounds weird [REDACTED] this is the good one and it should go up okay.  So what I'm going to do for that is that you're on niacin right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So you're taking niacin 500 mg?
PATIENT: 500 right.
DOCTOR: We can do 1000 mg and see how you do.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay and do you take aspirin before that?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay good, make sure you do that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So the good went down and the bad up.
DOCTOR: Yeah but the bad went up to 110 but it's not like your goal should be less than 130.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It is.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You know, we also, for everybody that has cholesterol, it's [REDACTED] go up on your medication, it depends on the specific person.  So we have to go through you risk factors for developing coronary artery disease before I can change [REDACTED] some of the medication
PATIENT: Okay.  Okay.
DOCTOR: But each patient's goal is different so I'm going to get [REDACTED] refills now and then um what I'm going to do next is kind of adjust the medication accordingly.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It's kind of like difficult [REDACTED] requiremens.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: So you're 67 is that right?
PATIENT: @@ yes.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: I'll be 67 in September.
DOCTOR: Okay so age [REDACTED], the blood pressure matters, [REDACTED] cholesterol matters, your HDL is 29 and you are on blood pressure, you don't smoke right?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: You don't have diabetes.
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: So I think I'll just keep it the way it is for now and see how you do.
PATIENT: See how I do, okay.
DOCTOR: We go up.  Cause you were on 80 before right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: I would go up just a little bit to 40 and just keep you on that because I think we'd just have better control with the 40.
PATIENT: Let’s do that then.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED] niacin at all cause that's going to affect your HDL [REDACTED], so we'll keep you on 40 [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We have that done.  Let's see what else.  [REDACTED] and we did your cholesterol already right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So we talked about your weight. Which is great.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] it's supposed to be down to like 117 [REDACTED].  I think I need to do more exercising and burn it off that way.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I think I've learned my portion size and now I just get the exercise in and [REDACTED] like that.  I've been wanting to do that goal [REDACTED].  And I can [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And then we ought to, so we kind of check the PSA levels and the last one in February [REDACTED] checking it right?
PATIENT: Yes, yes.
DOCTOR: Um so your PSA is 1.37 um and in the past they were a little bit lower.  Just so you know, that doesn't mean anything in terms of its dangerous and all okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It just means that it's higher um and I just wanted to ask you do you have any symptoms at all.  Like are you feeling like um, do you feel like you have urination at all?
PATIENT: I do get up like twice a night.
DOCTOR: Okay and is that bothersome to you?
PATIENT: Not really.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: I could probably, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's that I'll get up from 10 o'clock around 1:23 [REDACTED] early in the morning and then at 4 o'clock or 4:30 something like that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] it doesn't seem like it's a lot, I mean it's enough to go but it's just like, why wake me up.  [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  If it gets worse, we can always start you on medication if you’re willing to try it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Uh but it's been like two times at night?
PATIENT: Yeah, at least two times at night.
DOCTOR: If it gets worse [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay, that's fine.  I usually go to bed at 9 or 10 and by 1 o'clock.  Like I get up [REDACTED].

PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No, no, no.

DOCTOR: And were you involved with Agent Orange?
PATIENT: I was in [REDACTED] so you know we serviced the helicopters, [REDACTED].  We were in a huge [REDACTED] you know, like taking troops back and forth but they brought in them at night [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  So did they ever do Agent Orange in the [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: They did them here [REDACTED] but nothing showed up but like I said [REDACTED] since 66-67 but.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But [REDACTED] washed the helicopters out again [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  And the other lab values all looks okay.  Your creatinine level was a little high but you know your baseline when it's been like that, do you have any problems urinating at all?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: And you don't have diabetes right?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: And you don't aches or anything?
PATIENT: What?

PATIENT: What’s it supposed to be? 130/80.
DOCTOR: It should be in the 70s.
