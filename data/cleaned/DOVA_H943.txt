SECOND PERSON H943
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um with the fevers and chills you say you've been having as well, we might want to give you a similar antibiotics to what the doctor gave you when you saw him in February, the azithromycin antibiotics that you took back then.  We'll probably give you some [REDACTED] to break up the mucous [REDACTED] so I'm gonna go and talk with um my boss a little bit more about it, okay.  Then I'll come back and we'll talk more.  You just wait here and I'll come go talk to him and be right back.

PATIENT: Would I get it once I leave here?
DOCTOR: We can give it to you still when you leave today.  Probably a good idea for you.

PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  71:03  DOCTOR IN:  79:20)
DOCTOR: You're gonna have an EKG done while you're here okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And um and we're gonna order some tests because some of the symptoms that you describe are you know a little bit concerning given your risk factors there may be something going on with your heart okay.  So we're gonna have you go over and uh they're gonna take the EKG now.  Do you know what an EKG is?  They put those little things on there to check the electricity of the heart and then um I'll have you go over to the Heart Clinic and then they'll schedule you for a couple of tests.  One is a stress test; do you know what a stress test is?
PATIENT: No I heard about it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Basically um they give you some medications to put a little bit of stress on the heart, makes it beat fast when it makes the vessels dilate, putting a little stress on the heart and then they take images of the heart and they see if there's any evidence if there's lack of blood flow in the heart.  That's called a stress test.  So they put stress on the heart and they visualize significant strain on it and um so we can have that scheduled.  It's probably not going to be able to get done today but we can have you go over there and get it checked.  Um we're also going to do a lung test, a pulmonary function test considering you're a smoker and with your symptoms that you have now um you probably have something called COPD or emphysema seeing that you’ve been smoking for a long time.  So we'll have to see, not now, I’m thinking you know with your cough and so on, but once that's resolved we should schedule you to get that done.  Basically [REDACTED].
(Someone knocked on the door)  The EKG technician tells the patient to prepare and he'll come back with the machine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The pulmonary test is you'll sit in a little, kind of in a box and then they'll give you a tube that you breathe into pretty hard and then they measure the volume of your lungs, it's called a pulmonary function test and we'll get that checked as well.  And then we'll also I'll give you some antibiotics and some medication to loosen the phlegm so you can cough it out and the albuterol.
PATIENT: They said that if I want to see a dentist I have to talk to my primary doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes.  We could possibly, um I can refer you over there to see if they'll see you or not.  I don't know.  It's a little bit more complicated than that like they have all sorts of conditions allowing you to be seen in the Dental Clinic but we can refer you.  Yes.  The EKG technician performs the EKG.
DOCTOR: What's your phone number PATIENT?
PATIENT: Uh NUMBER.
DOCTOR: NUMBER.
PATIENT: NUMBER.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: NUMBER.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The EKG looks okay.  Alright I'm gonna go show this to the boss; I'll be back pretty soon.  It looks pretty good here.  I'll be right back.
(DOCTOR OUT:  90:31  DOCTOR IN:  91:14)
DOCTOR: You can put your shirt back on.  So if this chest pain comes back you should definitely come in to Urgent Care or the Emergency Room to evaluate it okay.

SECOND PERSON H943
