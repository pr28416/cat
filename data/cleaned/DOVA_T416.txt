PATIENT: A sleeping oh, you mean come in here and do a.
DOCTOR: Yes and do you know if you snore or that kind of thing?
PATIENT: No I don't snore.
DOCTOR: Yeah and the reason is, you when know they can see if you have sleep apnea if you have something causing to do that.  Is pain waking you up at all?  Pain in your legs?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And I think last time we talked about good sleep hygiene is any of that helping you?  Like not watching TV and you know you're having dinner past 6, that should be fine, you're not drinking too water or caffeine before bed?
PATIENT: No definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: In fact I only drink half a cup of coffee in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay and then your bedroom is like quiet, dark.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.

DOCTOR: Do you have bad dreams?
PATIENT: Everybody  had a bad dream every now and then but that doesn't, I just ignore that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'm just going to add that you have bad dreams.
PATIENT: This probably would have been okay but it's more of a you know it's just like I'm not depressed.
DOCTOR: Right, right.
PATIENT: So that's not that.
DOCTOR: Right, right. You take anti-depressants.
PATIENT: Yeah so that uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah and I still think a sleeping study would tell us why you can't sleep or at least rule some things out.  Okay you're taking, how much methadone are you taking?
PATIENT: About 7.
DOCTOR: So you'll be off of it soon.
PATIENT: Yeah, next month.

DOCTOR: I was trying to see if there are any medications you're taking that, -- cause the problems with medications for sleep, a lot of them are bad for your liver.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And you have hepatitis C; I really don't want to give you anything you know some of the normal drugs we give for a liver, for sleep are very, very bad for liver patients.
PATIENT: Oh then I can go without sleeping.
DOCTOR: Oh, but that's why but I want to help you um but at the same time you know we can't really.
PATIENT: And I can go without the sleep if it’s bad for the liver; it's just not that, I can deal with it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So, yeah there's not as many medications that we can do for that um.  Let's see you’re 61 and you're on something for diabetes.  Your last A1c was good and you're taking the metformin and that's fine.

DOCTOR: Maybe the finasteride?  I recently, the nicotine patches were all gone, methadone, well, I don’t do the methadone.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Tamsulosin, metformin?  You have refills.
PATIENT: That's probably what it was.
DOCTOR: Or aspirin maybe.
PATIENT: No I got it, it wasn't aspirin.  Like I say when I get it I order the next one so I have a.
DOCTOR: It might be the mirtazapine, you only one, you have 0 refills.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That probably was it then.
DOCTOR: I'll renew all the medicines.  Okay.

PATIENT: Okay.  Come on.
DOCTOR: Tangled there.

DOCTOR: See what they are, good.  We'll have you follow up with a CT in a couple weeks of your liver February 29h.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um and I'm going to talk to my attending about the sleep.  I mean honestly, I think the best thing to do is get a sleep study but if you're not really interested in doing that, you know.  I'll just see what my attending says and see if he's got any other ideas.  Um and then we'll go from there.  Now do me a favor, next time out, check your blood pressure at home and tell me what it is.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Cause last time you were here it was high and with me it's high and I won't, you know you drank coffee and you know you haven't.

PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  58:45  DOCTOR IN:  67:48)
DOCTOR: Alright.  We're going to do all those same things.  Um I'll see you in six months, but I think I am going to start the lisinopril actually.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The other blood pressure medicine.  The other blood pressure medication.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: I'd like to start it, there's a couple of reasons.  Um it's mainly a protective for your kidneys for people who have diabetes.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh, so I'm going to start you on a small dose and have you come back, I'll have you come back in two weeks for a blood pressure check.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um and I'll have you come back in two weeks, so you can get all your labs in two weeks actually.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Yeah let's do that.  So in two weeks you'll come up here and we'll just check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And in two weeks we'll check a BNP.
PATIENT: What's the BNP now?
DOCTOR: Your chemistry, electrolytes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Your creatinine, that way cause sometimes the medication can have a little effect, usually for most people its fine um.  Can you pick up your medication today?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And the one thing that’s good for sleep and liver disease is trazodone.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um we can try that, a small dose of that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll see how you're doing and you know and we'll just take the mirtazapine off.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We know that it wasn't.  I think that's about it, let me see if there's anything else that I need to do uh and as far as, we'll try the trazodone and as far as sleep hygiene, things like exercising before bed can help.
PATIENT: But that's what I do.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I exercise, yeah.
DOCTOR: You do all that.
PATIENT: I do everything.
DOCTOR: What about eating before bed?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I start to try to exercise at 8 o'clock and I usually try to go to sleep about 9:30.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I have no trouble going to sleep, just trouble staying asleep.
DOCTOR: So I want to take off your mirtazapine.  Oh it's expired anyway okay.  Okay, then that's pretty much it.  Okay.  And you start on the trazodone and then we should be good.
PATIENT: So you want me to do labs before the two weeks though right?
DOCTOR: No just like at two weeks yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: At two weeks cause we're gonna start that new blood pressure medication today.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So you can pick it up downstairs.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then in two weeks uh you'll come up here for a blood pressure check and get your labs done and we'll do all your labs at that time.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: That way, we don’t have to stick you more than once.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So right now once you check out, someone will help you get your vaccines.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright good to see you.
PATIENT: Alright take care, have a good week.
