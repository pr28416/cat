DOCTOR: PATIENT?

DOCTOR: How are you?
PATIENT: I'm fine thank you.
DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR.  Nice to meet you.
PATIENT: Same to you.  I just getting ready to pop out of here.
DOCTOR: Oh really?
PATIENT: And get some coffee.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah? [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: How you feeling today?
PATIENT: Oh I'm alright.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: I guess.
DOCTOR: As good as you can be huh.
PATIENT: Yeah it's always something.
DOCTOR: So how's your diabetes?
PATIENT: Well um it was high this morning cause uh I had something I wasn't supposed to have but I had a craving.
DOCTOR: I see.
PATIENT: And I had some fish and fries so it was 156 this morning.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Are you just taking the glyburide for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Who?
DOCTOR: Glyburide is that the only medication you're taking?
PATIENT: No I'm taking that and uh they changed uh, they took me off the adda, started with a uh, something that was supposed to have been pulled off the market.
DOCTOR: Actos.
PATIENT: I think that's what it was and put me on this new started with a p, p . . .
DOCTOR: Pioglitazone?
PATIENT: I think so.
DOCTOR: Cause it's not in any of your uh.
PATIENT: I get them refilled.
DOCTOR: Where do you get it from?
PATIENT: Here.  I just got it refilled.  I'm gonna start taking it now.
DOCTOR: You're on the glyburide that's the only thing I see that you're on.
PATIENT: No I take two of them.  I take two for high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Rosiglitazone?
PATIENT: And two, who?
DOCTOR: Rosiglitazone?
PATIENT: That might be it.  I take two for diabetes and two for high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: No you're on the pioglitazone that's what you're on.
PATIENT: That's the P.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: There we go.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um yeah when checked your A1c last month it was perfect, you were right on target at 7 so that's good.  That's where we want you, that or below.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that's good.  What are your sugars normally then when you're not giving in to your cravings?
PATIENT: Um well actually I took it twice yesterday cause um, yeah yesterday, cause the nurse came it in the afternoon, that was about 4 and it was 71.  She said you need to eat.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So uh I kind of over did it, it was 156 this morning.
DOCTOR: Could you feel it, did you feel the 71 or did you?
PATIENT: Not really.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you check your sugars in the morning?
PATIENT: Usually every morning but I'm up at 3 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Cause I have to be here at 5:30.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: I work for CWT Police Department.
DOCTOR: Oh I see.
PATIENT: It's just a temporary thing.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But uh.
DOCTOR: So what do your sugars run then?
PATIENT: They staying low, under 100.
DOCTOR: Usually under 100.
PATIENT: I should have brought my machine; I knew I forgot something this morning.
DOCTOR: Do they ever go below 70?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: They do?
PATIENT: Once in a blue moon.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But do you ever get periods where you feel really shaky, clammy, sweaty, anything like that?
PATIENT: Once in a while.
DOCTOR: How often?
PATIENT: That's cause I'm trying to really cut down and uh, I don’t eat, um.
DOCTOR: Well if that's the case then we need to be careful with your glucose and the medicine you're taking for your diabetes.  I mean and you have lost, you've lost about 20 pounds.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Since March, that's excellent.
PATIENT: Thank you.  It's a start.
DOCTOR: It's a great start.
PATIENT: I've got 70 more to go.  I got to get under 200.
DOCTOR: Well if you get down that low you probably won't even need anything for your diabetes, right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And your blood pressure looks great today.  Um my only concern is that if you're not eating as much as you should be, what I would say to you is that the glyburide can be decreased caused that's the one that's going to drop your sugar the most.
PATIENT: That's them little blue pills right?
DOCTOR: I don't know what they look like.
PATIENT: Oblong.
DOCTOR: It's the one that you take two tablets.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Twice a day.
PATIENT: That's the blue one yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So here's what I'll say to you about that if you know, like what meals are you skipping out on?
PATIENT: Breakfast.
DOCTOR: Breakfast is the one?  Then what you could do is just take one tablet of glyburide in the morning, actually let me take that back.  You can take one tablet of glyburide at night cause it's that dose that's gonna affect your morning sugars the most.  So what we can do is actually just peel back and just do 10 in the morning, since you take two tablets and just do one of that at night and we'll see how it goes.
PATIENT: If it’s low in the morning.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  If you're noticing that consistently for a couple of days, they're running pretty well like if you're in the low 70 or even 80s then just take one at night.  Cause normal blood sugars in the morning is between 90 to 120, that's really the range we want you in.  Um so if it's anything lower than that, then maybe we should just try the 5 mg okay.
PATIENT: It's not a consistent thing so I'll just check.  You know maybe I should check it more than once a day.
DOCTOR: You could check it maybe one time after another meal, two hours after a meal or right before dinner or something like that.  Um I mean if you're consistent below 100 on your sugars then maybe we should just cut you back to 5 mg at night um because the only thing is.  I mean if you do that and you start noticing your sugars are going up to 140s, 150s then you can go back to taking the two tablets but um.  You know my concern is I don't want you to become hypoglycemic where you're running too low cause that's actually a little bit more of a concern than if they're too high.
PATIENT: That's what I heard.  Yeah.
DOCTOR: So why don't we actually do that.  Why don't you just cut back to 5 mg at night okay?
PATIENT: You're not going to change the prescription, are you?
DOCTOR: Um no I'm just telling you and.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll write it down for you if you need me to.
PATIENT: No I got it.
DOCTOR: You got it.
PATIENT: Yes I got it.
DOCTOR: Alright, um any other concerns or issues?
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: Cholesterol looked fantastic too, so.
PATIENT: I um, yeah I still have this cough.  It's not as bad as it used to be but uh I still have this cough uh and the doctor had said a few years ago that I had this acid build-up thing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh.
DOCTOR: Is it a dry cough?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Is it getting worse, the same, better?
PATIENT: It flares up, ever since, it flares up every once in a while but I don't know exactly what's causing it.  You know like I'm a Buddhist so I burn incense in the morning.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: If I breathe in the incense you know I begin to cough.  Um after I eat something like crackers or something like that uh, it's kind of like a choking cough; you know what I'm saying?  It's not a cold cough or.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I don't know how to explain it.
DOCTOR: Well that kind of sounds more of like an allergic reaction or um like an irritant so the incense, the smoke in and of itself can be an irritant to the back of your throat and that's when you kind of have that like, kind of almost a violent cough cause your body's trying to expel it um but um I mean you're on the ranitidine for acid reflux.  Are you still taking that?  Its 150 mg you take at bedtime.
PATIENT: No I haven't taken that in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They was killing me with these charges so I just uh you know I don't want to owe nothing but I haven't taken it in a while.  Maybe I should start back on it, I don't know.
DOCTOR: You can try.  Did you notice any improvement when you were taking it?
PATIENT: Some yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I mean, acid is a real irritant to the back of the throat too um so it could definitely be contributing.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'm just about out of prescription wise on some of those medications but I, I know that one that starts with a P I had to call over here and I had to go and take a blood test to get it re uh.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah you have six refills on that now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let's see what some of these are.  Do you still use that um betamethasone which is like um a steroid cream for your skin?  Do you still requiring that at all?
PATIENT: No.  One of them was real good but I can't remember which one it was now.  I just can't remember which one that really worked better than all of them but I can't remember which one it was.  The dermatologist prescribed it.  I was trying to think of what it was so.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you still have it at home?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: It hasn't been refilled in a long time.  What are you using it for?  What was the ointment for?
PATIENT: I had a rash on my uh, one on each leg inside here back here and then I came back in the Emergency Room cause I had a real bad uh, well I got a torn ligament here.  You know about that right?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it still bothering me.  But something happened to my right leg up in here and uh they gave me some, something like Ben Gay.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And some pills.  Oh you know what, before I forget all that, uh I got real, real sick here about a month ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I woke up.  I had some yogurt and some fruit and I went to bed and uh at Tuesday morning, cause I was off that Tuesday, I had the worst stomach ache I've ever had and I started, I didn't eat for three, four days.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then I started back with uh oatmeal you know and but when I did finally go to the washroom, my stool was black.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: And yesterday I noticed it was real dark also.  I don't know what it was.  I didn't come to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Sounds like an ulcer.  Are you, what are you taking?  Do you take any ibuprofen or is it from the aspirin, baby aspirin?
PATIENT: Um I take the baby aspirin now.  The doctor told me to cut down, the doctor said to cut down to 81 cause I was taking 325 at night.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: 81 um but uh and my urine was orange on a couple of mornings.  This was a month or so ago.  Now it's like lemonade probably in color.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But uh I don't know what happened but uh you know.
DOCTOR: It sounds like an ulcer um that probably got irritated and bled and that's what caused your dark stools.  Um have you ever had a scope where they take a look into your stomach?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: So I mean that's kind of what it sounds like and that's what the point of the actually instead of the ranitidine I'd give you something else um, it's a little stronger for acid suppression.
PATIENT: Oh just thinking about them going down my nose, oh.
DOCTOR: It's down your throat actually but you'll be sedated, you would be sedated if they do that test.
PATIENT: Oh, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You don't want that?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I mean that's kind of what it sounds like so what we could do um is also start on that PPI and we'll give you omeprazole um so you can take that once a day and what I can do is check you for this bacteria called H. pylori that can sometimes happen in the stomach um and also it can create ulcers in your stomach actually um and if you do have H. pylori it's very treatable.  You just take a course of antibiotics for two weeks um and that'll knock it out.  Because those things, that bacteria can be really irritating on the stomach and actually cause ulcers so it's good to, um if you have it to treat it because otherwise if you kind of let it fester for years and years and years then what can happen eventually it can cause a type of cancer in the stomach.  So it'd be good to figure out if you have it or not.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And all of that is that it requires you to um, it just requires you to send in a stool sample, that's the best test that we have to see if you have it.  So what you can do is you can go to the Lab and we'll get you the container that you need to put your stool in and send that in.  Can you sit up there for me?  So what are you doing to lose weight?  You said you've been cutting back on things? Are you exercising?
PATIENT: Um not really.  I'm uh, I was going to a gym but uh then I got hurt at that gym.  You want me to take this off?
DOCTOR: No that's okay; you can just take your glasses off for me if you could.
PATIENT: I got hurt at that gym.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's how I tore my ligament again.
DOCTOR: Oh I see.  Do you swim at all?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Have you ever noticed bright red blood in your stool or is it just the dark stools?
PATIENT: And this was uh oh it was a month or two ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: When I had that stomach thing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I finally went to the bathroom and then I think it was last night.
DOCTOR: You had another episode?
PATIENT: Looked dark to me but I had had some mustard and turnip greens for lunch too.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know if that was it or not, you know it could've been.
DOCTOR: Deep breath.  Go ahead and lay back for me for a second.  I just want to listen to your belly.
PATIENT: Any way you can remove it.
DOCTOR: If only, then I'd be a rich woman.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Any pain in here at all?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: No pain in here now?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: You can sit up.
PATIENT: How long are you going to be here now?
DOCTOR: I will be here until um June of next year.  You know what we didn’t get on you last time was your blood count, why didn't they do that?  You were 11.8 a year ago.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  The problem is your, you are anemic cause your blood count was low and the MCV which is one of the numbers that we look at tells me that you may be a little bit iron deficient and typically if you're iron deficient and you're anemic that means you're having some form of blood loss from your GI tract.  So it's a little, the thing is you developed this anemia after you had the colonoscopy in 2007 and the iron studies, your iron was a little bit low but the rest of the labs looked okay.
PATIENT: I was all uh, always borderline.
DOCTOR: You were.
PATIENT: Yeah I was always borderline uh I don't eat a lot of meat.  The last check was B12 and whatever.
DOCTOR: Yeah I guess your blood levels have been pretty stable for the past five years.  The meat aspect could definitely do it too okay.  So what I would say is, could we get a repeat of your blood count today?  Would that be possible here next week sometime?
PATIENT: What have my shot or what?
DOCTOR: Yeah just the blood tests, from the Lab.
PATIENT: I ain't ate so so I guess I'm still under the fasting thing.
DOCTOR: Well that's fine; it's the kind you don't need to be fasting.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So that'll actually be fine.  Um so I'll put it in and then you can get that done and pick up the stool cup too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So give me just a minute, let me put in the omeprazole for you.
PATIENT: So the medicine I'm on is cool right?
DOCTOR: Which one?
PATIENT: Uh all of them.
DOCTOR: Yeah the only one I'm changing is the acid reflux one; I'm changing it to a different type of an acid reflux medication that's a little bit stronger.
PATIENT: Take it at night too?
DOCTOR: That one you can take in the morning before you eat, like half an hour before you eat.
PATIENT: Is that the one that look like a little capsule?
DOCTOR: I don't know what they look like to be honest.  People ask me that all the time, I have no idea what the medication looks like.  I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  51:19  DOCTOR IN:  54:50)
(Patient makes the statement "Yeah you make a note cause I know you listening but this is the prettiest doctor I have ever been to.")
DOCTOR: Alrighty.  So I put in for that omeprazole at the Pharmacy if you are able to pick that up today.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: And then if you don't mind just going to the Lab to draw your blood and get that stool um and then just remember the glyburide, your diabetes medication to take one pill at night instead of the two.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and I want to see you back in three months.  If you notice that you're having more frequent dark stools like you had a month ago you need to come in and we need to have GI see you cause that means that you're having some ongoing bleeding from your stomach or somewhere in your upper GI tracts okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: I know it doesn't sound pleasant to have that procedure done but it's actually quicker than a colonoscopy um and they sedate you for that as well.
PATIENT: One is just as bad as the other.
DOCTOR: I know but I just don't want you bleeding, continously from your stomach okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Do you have any callers?
DOCTOR: I don't.  I [REDACTED] at home.  I [REDACTED].
PATIENT: So how am I gonna be able to reach you without going through that computer you know if I have to?
DOCTOR: The best way to do it is to sort of call one of the nurses here in the Gold Clinic and then they pass those messages along to us.  Cause I'm usually not actually at the VA site, I'm over at UNC so um the best way is when they page me and let me know that you want to talk to me.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And that's it, alright.
PATIENT: Okie dokie.
DOCTOR: Very nice meeting you.
PATIENT: Nice meeting you.  Doc you have a good day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, you too.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: 56:44
Time is 10:05.
