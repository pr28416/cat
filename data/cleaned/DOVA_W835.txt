PATIENT: Oh.  Good morning.
DOCTOR: How are you?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Anywhere in particular?
DOCTOR: Um let's see maybe you can set this chair over here.  Okay.  So I can't believe it's been such a long time.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: Since I've seen you.  I'm looking back [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh my gosh really.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Time flies when you're having fun huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah so what's been going on?
PATIENT: Uh nothing, I donâ€™t ... and I've been trying to get a knee replacement but I've had um cellulitis so many times.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: We were just going to do it on February 24th and on February 20th I got it again.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Like right over the knee?  Is that where you're getting the?
PATIENT: No it was down the leg you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know here like.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So it's been, with no wound, couldn't figure it out but.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: In the hospital for a week but, a few days, four days in.
DOCTOR: And where was that?
PATIENT: CDH of DuPage.
DOCTOR: CDH okay.
PATIENT: So a DOCTOR the orthopedic surgeon he's kind of backed off it now cause.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's been three times it's happened.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So and I'm still confused.  There was one doctor said it comes from the MRSA.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The cellulitis is a MRSA.  I never knew that uh, I just thought cellulitis was cellulitis and MRSA was MRSA.
DOCTOR: No I, MRSA is a common cause for cellulitis.
PATIENT: Oh really?
DOCTOR: If you're in the hospital a lot, you can get the hospital-acquired kind and sometimes you hear on the news about like you know outbreaks at schools or something where a lot of students at school, seem to pass that are around each other.
PATIENT: So you can get cellulitis in other places besides your legs?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Yeah you can get it anywhere and it's not always cellulitis.  Sometimes you get little abscesses.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um but I think you in particular are kind of prone to getting.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: The cellulitis.  Now you're probably colonant to it, meaning that you've got this bacteria that lives in your skin all the time.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um just like you know because I work in the hospital I probably have it too but.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If you have a little break in your skin, something that makes you susceptible it can take hold and it kind of flourishes there.
PATIENT: It's probably true because I was putting my wheelchair in the back of my Honda Pilot and taking it out, I was always hitting myself or cutting myself so the VA got me a lift.  So that did away with that anyway [REDACTED] came back.
DOCTOR: It came back anyway.
PATIENT: But I was wondering maybe the VA would replace the knee.  That's why I went to Orthopedics, see what they said.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause it is an injury from the service.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So I don't know.
DOCTOR: Uh yeah I'd be interested to hear why, you know what exactly is preventing them at CDH. I mean it's that [REDACTED] one person idea once there is infection, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: You know no matter what hospital you go to.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so it may be the right decision that they're making cause you know I mean the last thing we want, as you know, is if there is an infection anywhere.
PATIENT: MRSA.
DOCTOR: Cause you want, you know a new knee in there and then have it be infected.
PATIENT: Yeah I know cause I got a new knee here.
DOCTOR: Right.  But I know it's frustrating um.
PATIENT: Could I at least go see him though so I can tell those folks at [REDACTED] Medical that they don't think it's a good idea either?
DOCTOR: Uh, yeah we'll see if we can get you in their clinic.  Alright um, anything else going on?  Have you been?
PATIENT: I been pretty good.
DOCTOR: Have you been?
PATIENT: Except you know the CO, there you go.
DOCTOR: COPD?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I met DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So he told me not to, well he didn't say not to, he just said why don't you just start coming and see me at the VA?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I been seeing him now.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And did they change around any of your medications?
PATIENT: No, he thought that was a pretty good idea.  I wish I could see him today cause I've been on tramadol.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I need some, I don't know if you can give it to me, some of that uh, what they call it, Nystatin.
DOCTOR: Oh are you getting some.
PATIENT: Oh gosh.
DOCTOR: Stuff on your tongue.
PATIENT: Oh they're terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's burning like.
DOCTOR: So how much prednisone are you taking a day?
PATIENT: I've been taking.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry (doctor was paged).
PATIENT: Oh that's alright.  Uh it's generally 10.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But he did give me permission, he said you know you're going to have to [REDACTED].  You know I explained to him about how the 10 can really make a difference.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: In your breathing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I have taken 20 on some days.  I was up in Minnesota; I got sick so I was taking 20 for about a week.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How recently was that?
PATIENT: Uh two weeks ago and then I tapered down to 10.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then I did 5's and now I'm back to 10.
DOCTOR: Did you do okay on the fives?
PATIENT: No, it's like cheating yourself.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: That's another thing I wanted to ask you doctor.  I'm really a [REDACTED].  They have this commercial for, I think its Sally Field.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: She takes a pill once a month or once every three months for uh bone loss.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Why won't they give that to men [REDACTED]?
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: She takes that because of that prednisone or is she taking it because of I'm wonder if.
DOCTOR: Well it's called, I mean woman are more, get.
PATIENT: Oh osteoporosis yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah, although being on prednisone does put you at risk for osteoporosis and other bone problems so I don't see anywhere um that you've had a scan looking for osteoporosis.
PATIENT: No I haven't in years.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: I had one about ten years ago.
DOCTOR: Did you?
PATIENT: Yeah and they said there was narrowing at the hips or something to do with.  It wasn't here though, it was [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Cause what it's called is a DEXA scan is what we'd be looking at.
PATIENT: Yeah it's pretty simple isn't it, just a quick wand and.
DOCTOR: Yeah let's see.
PATIENT: I was kind of wondering if I could get something like that to see if.
DOCTOR: Yeah I think that's reasonable so maybe we can get you set up with that.  Okay.  You're full of good ideas today.  Um okay, so.
PATIENT: That must be some pill she takes, cause I thought she said every 90 days.
DOCTOR: Yeah there are a variety of different kinds.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So there are some that you take every week, there are some you take every month there are some you take once a year.
PATIENT: How does it work, it just boycotts the bone loss somehow?
DOCTOR: Right, it kind of freezes the bone and prevents it from uh; it prevents it from breaking itself down.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Which can happen you know when you're on certain medications or in women who have gone through menopause.  However, it's not good to be on it forever so it's something we kind of use when we need it.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: That's why we do the tests, we do the scans, to make sure that someone has osteoporosis so like really true bone loss before um, before we prescribe it.
PATIENT: There could be a chance I might not have bone loss, but probably not huh, I don't know.
DOCTOR: Well you never know.  How long have you been on the prednisone for?
PATIENT: Well I on and off 20-30 years probably yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So we'll put in the Nystatin, you like the liquid stuff that you swish around and swallow?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  It really relieves that burning.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And how often do you use it?  A couple times a day or twice a day.
PATIENT: Yes. Uh probably at least once a day but probably twice a day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Some of the instructions say you can swallow it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: One doctor told me don't swallow it, it's not good for the kidneys.
DOCTOR: Oh.  Um I'll have to take a look.  You can swish and spit.
PATIENT: Okay.  Like in the saloon huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.  Alright do you want to pick it up at the window or have it mailed to you?
PATIENT: I'd rather pick it up if I could.  I've got just a teeny bit left.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright, let's see what else.
PATIENT: I'm also going to try to go upstairs and see if they can give me a shot in the elbow.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah it's been helping you right.
PATIENT: Oh boy they really help.
DOCTOR: Good.  Now are you, did you take a look at the medication list that we printed out for you?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Well are we missing anything.  There must be more than we've got on here right now.
PATIENT: Uh yeah I'm taking something for the prostate uh.  Oh God, let's see what I got.  There was a commercial on television, football is driving me nuts.  I keep going, I keep going, I keep going uh.  I wonder what's the name of that stuff?
DOCTOR: Uh is it Flomax?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Flomax.
DOCTOR: And you get that from an outside doctor?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay and are you taking the hydrochlorothiazide for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes.

DOCTOR: Are you taking alprazolam?
PATIENT: Is that Xanax?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And how about, are you on a Fentanyl patch?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: You are alright.
PATIENT: That's the reason why I'd like to get this knee thing done.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: But like you said if one set of doctors thinks it's a bad idea.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Alright so you're taking the lisinopril for your blood pressure, what am I missing?  Are you taking a stool softener?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: What, do you know what you take?

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Oh I was taking uh Viagra but Blue Cross, they didn't drop it but they raised it to $50 a pill so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That kind of blew me out of the ballpark for that and someone gave me Cialis.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Which is, I don't see what it does but I have some of that.  That in itself is, Blue Cross will allow you 24 every 50 days.

He said itâ€™s - an infectious disease doctor and he listened to my heart and he asked me, you better go to Cardiology cause I hear something there, I'm not sure what I'm hearing but.
DOCTOR: Okay.

PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause I can put in for the consult for the orthopedist, they'll contact you about setting up an appointment.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you can ask them about a possible knee replacement.  Um they would want us to kind of reassure them that from a cardiac standpoint, from a lung standpoint.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That you would be okay potentially to even go to surgery so um, so as long as you haven't been told that for some reason your heart wouldn't be able to withstand surgery or your lungs wouldn't be able to.
