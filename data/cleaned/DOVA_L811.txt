DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR, nice to meet you. [REDACTED].  How you doing?
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: Uh [REDACTED] huh finally.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's kind of a tease at the moment.  It looks nicer than it is out there.  Yeah.  Uh how have things been going?
PATIENT: Oh just you know, it might be the cholesterol medicine and I did take that uh fasting blood test.  But when I call them up to refill it, they say it’s not ready yet or something like that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But the uh, the new reflux pill works perfect.
DOCTOR: Does it?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t have any reaction to it [REDACTED] burning you know, in the chest and that and I'm taking once in the morning but it’s a really big improvement from what there was.  Cause for the last month, I got a cold and during the you now blowing your nose, [REDACTED] it feels like I'm congested in the head and when I blow my nose my nose bleeds, not a lot but just you know a little bit on the Kleenex and then I'm always stuffy now and it's oh, been like a month.
DOCTOR: You never had that before?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And you're stuffed up now?
PATIENT: Basically stuffed up, just hard to breathe [REDACTED]. (Knock at the door.) Shall I open that?
DOCTOR: Yep. Uh okay uh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And I've been feeling kind of crampy and drained out but uh [REDACTED] but the back is like you know just about normal.  I mean it's you know you get that kind of thing where it's difficult to you know put on your socks and shoes but the pain tolerance.  Cause I take the uh, you told me to switch to the Excedrin so I take that and it relieves it a little bit and I really don't, you know, I'm not physical.  I don't you know really do anything but walk the dog.
DOCTOR: You have, that's right.  Do you drink any alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh yeah I have a beer once in a while and uh Sunday, I had a birthday yesterday so we got a couple of glasses of wine with dinner.  But drink-drinks, I don't drink.
DOCTOR: Uh you haven't had any thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No my dad had a thyroid problem.  Thirty years ago.
DOCTOR: Now your cholesterol has [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Would you like me keeping taking the pills or?
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, so you're almost there with your bad cholesterol.  You're almost where you need to be um but uh your triglycerides.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Are up pretty high as well.
PATIENT: Oh it's high?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Do you think they should be like 100 something?
DOCTOR: Under 160 your triglycerides.  Your are 480.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: Well that could be, since I wasn't taking the medicine though right?
DOCTOR: Well the medicine, you know actually come on over here I want to show you this stuff here.  So here's your good cholesterol, your LDL is your bad cholesterol and that's 105.  We like that over 100 if possible.  You're not far off.
PATIENT: It's not good.
DOCTOR: That's not too bad.  This is often the more important one.  This is the one that causes more trouble with heart attacks and strokes, things like that.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: This can definitely be an issue as well, the triglycerides.  Uh especially when they get over 500, that can actually irritate your pancreas and give you pancreatitis.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Um the guidelines say that we should go after this one first uh, in fact it's pretty hard.  If we get this to goal, that may help out your overall health.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But after you get to that goal, if it's high, we go after that. There are some medications that really knocks this down quite a bit but this is the more important one.
PATIENT: Now is it that because, you know, in the winter time, I don’t go out because I can’t afford to fall with the snow and ice. So, I’m more like housebound. Because even with the cane in the winter time. And falling, it’s just not worth going out of the house. Could that be from not doing anything? Not walking?
DOCTOR: It could definitely be you know, it takes several months of good exercise to kind of help that uh.  Alcohol can definitely make that worse.
PATIENT: Well like I might have within a week, I might have two drinks.   Is that bad?
DOCTOR: That’s okay.  The trouble is the triglycerides can irritate the pancreas and alcohol will do the same thing.  With your pancreas.  So there's a couple medications that we can do to try and bring that down um one, there are a few that actually have slightly increased risks of giving you muscle cramps and muscle breakdown like the statin you're taking now but there's also fish oil which can help bring those triglycerides down.  That’s going to be the safest one.
PATIENT: Okay.  Cause anything that gives me cramps I couldn't take it anymore.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My foot, you know like your foot is regular like this.  My foot will just turn to the inside and the toes will crinkle up and I can't even straighten out.  They can stay like that for 20 minutes at a time and finally get it straight, they'd be straight and relax for a little bit and then it's start again and do the same thing.
DOCTOR: Now this one's going to be more like the big proximal muscles the arms, things like that.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Fish oil first.  So the fish oil can cause a little bit of diarrhea.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] really like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED] work out well for you.  Any chest pain, any trouble breathing?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Then I caught a cold.  Seemed like, maybe February and then it just got worse and never got better.  I mean, it got better overall coughing but it just, my nose got all stuffed up and stayed like that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] fish oil [REDACTED] increase that statin medicine.  The pravastatin you're taking, we're going to give you a full pill.
PATIENT: And that's for the cholesterol?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I was breaking it in half.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  When do you take it?  What time of day?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I take the one, the reflex, I take that every morning about 9 o'clock and the other one I take it at the same time, I take it at bedtime.
DOCTOR: I prefer that you take that simvastatin at bedtime.
PATIENT: At bedtime okay, it's easy.
DOCTOR: The one for reflux, I don’t care, it works the same.
PATIENT: No I’ve been taking in the morning.
DOCTOR: This one you take [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: But it's not a huge deal.  The only one that really matters is the statin.
PATIENT: Okay, take it.
DOCTOR: The body makes more cholesterol when you're sleeping.
PATIENT: Oh yeah?
DOCTOR: So those medications kind of work.
PATIENT: Like after dinner take it?
DOCTOR: Yeah right before you go to bed.
PATIENT: Okay, I'll just take it then.
DOCTOR: But uh those medications kind of work a little bit better at bedtime, uh than they do during the day.
PATIENT: Now is that going to be the same numbers that I had for my calling in.
DOCTOR: Yeah always you can call into the same place.  So the simvastatin that you have now.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You need to start taking the full pill.
PATIENT: I don't have any.
DOCTOR: Oh you don't okay.
PATIENT: There are some things they could have thrown that out because I haven't had it for over a month.
DOCTOR: Yeah well it looks like it expired you know a while back. Uh so I just reordered it for you, but yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah same pharmacy.
PATIENT: Okay.  Oh I pick it up before I leave?
DOCTOR: Oh if you want to you can, otherwise I was just going to have it mailed.
PATIENT: Oh okay yeah that's good.
DOCTOR: Let's take a look at what [REDACTED].  Um otherwise what I want to do is get some blood work from you.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] today and three months from now.
PATIENT: I didn't fast today.
DOCTOR: That's fine.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Uh let me have a quick look at you.  Any ear pain or pressure?
PATIENT: Yeah the ears is always ringing and I took the hearing test where they put you in the thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh it [REDACTED] they tell you like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So they had fitted me for hearing aids, I did one and I then they did two and then it would do it would give me [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] I couldn’t take the pressure.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So then the doctor said that what was happening is the hearing aids were intensifying the ringing in my head, they just made it worse.  I could hear, you know I mean I could hear you better but what I.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Ringing. Uh open up for me ah.
PATIENT: Ah.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Give me a deep breath.  Is there any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Uh like if I'm really constipated it like affects the hemorrhoids and then I'll have blood, blood in the stool but not that normal.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah it's probably uh.
PATIENT: The EGD procedures.  But this leg could be like ice, it'll be like cold and you can’t like touch it, it’s like a tube of ice, is that like normal?
DOCTOR: Now what happened with the leg? Why you got the foot drop again?
PATIENT: I’ve had like five back operations.
DOCTOR: Okay so it's all from nerve damage.  Yeah it's likely due to the nerves.
PATIENT: These now, you know how you hear people are kind of weak in the legs, there's no circulation there.  I rub it a lot. I take the brace off and rub it up in there.
DOCTOR: Let me have you pop your shoes off real quick, your shoes and socks.  Or at least on that one foot.
PATIENT: Just the one right doc?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It’ll be, like a [REDACTED] This isn’t even too bad, it’ll be but just at nighttime it will be like purple, like a, just like a different color.  This will be whiter and this will be like real red.  When it get real bad, I’ll just lie down and elevated it pick up a little bit you know.
DOCTOR: This one is a bit cold.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] circulation.
DOCTOR: Can you feel me touching right here?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: These are all from the surgery. It's a nerve problem.  So unfortunately there's not really much I can do.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I can't feel like anything down here just past the ankle.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's from nerve damage.
PATIENT: Surgeries?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Those nerves that go down into the foot, they start up in the back.  Which is where they come out in there.
PATIENT: Like this I can feel but you can't feel nothing down there.
DOCTOR: Yeah so everything will start in the back and then they kind of split up as they go down so if there is, even if the problem is at the back, if there is just a compression on part of it, then that could be, you know depending on what part of that nerve some compression or damage to it, that could be up here and this could fine or it could be down there and this would be damaged.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] come back?  For a while I did physical therapy.
DOCTOR: Nerve damage takes a long long time to come back.
PATIENT: Yeah.  This has been like four years.
DOCTOR: But it's been several years so I don't think this is ever coming back uh.  I mean it’s often permanent.  [REDACTED] people have trouble with nerves for a long time.  It usually takes at least several months.
PATIENT: But that's good circulation right?
DOCTOR: Yeah there’s good blood flow.
PATIENT: But I mean, its okay I just can't use it good okay.
DOCTOR: Right.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh man.  [REDACTED] the worst.
DOCTOR: No.  Uh, alright for the nose, do you ever have trouble with allergies?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do you feel like you're draining a lot or does it feel like you're stuffed up and you can't get anything out?
PATIENT: It feels like it's stuffed up.  I'll take two showers a day, just heat it up and then I take [REDACTED] and it breaks it up a little bit.
DOCTOR: Well there's a couple things we can do for this.  I want you to take ibuprofen just for you know a couple of days.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: At most, because you know you had some trouble when you were taking all that ibuprofen with possible bleeding uh, what that can do is help reduce any inflammation there.
PATIENT: But just regular ibuprofen right?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  And then I'm gonna get you a nasal spray as well.
PATIENT: I’m using Vicks, would that be bad?
DOCTOR: That actually could just help you a bit.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what I do when it's really bad, I use that and it seems to open it up a little bit.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's totally fine.  So this an Afrin nasal spray, oxymetazoline um and that can help open things up.  You take it twice a day but I don't want you taking it for more than three days.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh if you want I can have you pick that up today.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: If that'd be easier for you, it's over-the-counter too.  But the problem is if you use it for more than three days and then stop it, sometimes you get what is called rebound and you can end up getting worse.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So cut it off at three days uh.  If you're having a lot of mucous, which it doesn't sound like, it sounds like it's more you know inflammation, congestion there [REDACTED] mucous and then you can take like a Mucinex, stuff like that.  You could try Zyrtec as well for allergies; it has some anti-inflammatories with that.  I don’t know if you want to pick that up today too?
PATIENT: Oh yeah I could you know wait for it, that's no problem.  Do you want to do the blood tests today?
DOCTOR: Yeah the blood tests will be today.  So it's actually going to be today and unfortunately since we’re changing some medications around, we've got to watch your liver function.  Your liver function looks okay but there's a lot [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Uh with that simvastatin, we changed the dosage we need to check.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah we just need to check it again when we change it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And [REDACTED].
PATIENT: So I'll come back in two weeks for another blood test?
DOCTOR: Yes just the blood test, you don't have to come to the clinic or anything like that.
PATIENT: And I won't have to fast?
DOCTOR: No, you won't have to fast for any of these tests.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then in three months I'd like you to come back to the clinic and they'll do blood work around that time and that one you'll need to be fasting.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now the one in three months, will they send me something.
DOCTOR: They should.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But uh if you don't hear anything then you need to call us.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So [REDACTED] the Zyrtec [REDACTED], it's also over-the-counter, it's an allergy pill.  If things start cleaning up you don't have to take it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, you can pick up the nasal spray today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I'm going to send you out the simvastatin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We'll do blood work today, two weeks, and then fasting blood work in three months.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: And then you'll come back to see me, actually it won't be me.
PATIENT: In July.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Uh so I'm actually going to be gone mid-June and I'm actually moving to Kansas City.
PATIENT: Oh really.
DOCTOR: So I won't be here so you'll have to get set up with another [REDACTED] resident [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.  Kansas City, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh I'm from there originally.
PATIENT: Oh, okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah family is there, mom and dad are still back there.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] yeah, yeah I'm pretty excited about it.
PATIENT: Home cooking.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Nothing like home cooking, I tell you that.
DOCTOR: So uh it looks like everything else is pretty well set up and I'm going to set you free but uh get the blood work today and.
PATIENT: Do I go down to the basement for that where they do the blood?
DOCTOR: When you check out up front here, uh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh ask them if they're, I'm not sure if they're still doing it down the hallway.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: They may, you can just look around.
PATIENT: Yeah right.
DOCTOR: You know if you get all the way down the hall and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh yeah, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Congratulations [REDACTED].  Take care.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
PATIENT: Oh okay then, give this to [REDACTED].  Thank you.
