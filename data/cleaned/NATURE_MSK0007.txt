DOCTOR: OK. And is there any numbness or tingling anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no, no numbness or tingling.
DOCTOR: OK. OK, so that was everything that I wanted to ask about today. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention?
PATIENT: No, that was that. What do you think I have and how can I fix it?
DOCTOR: Yeah, so it. It's certainly it it sounds like with the medial aspect of your elbow having pain there over the last several months and some of the physical exam maneuvers, such as like passive wrist extension, resisted wrist flexion as well as pronation and the point tenderness over the medial elbow this could be a medial epicondylitis or a tendinopathy in that area. And so this is typically treated with activity modification, so this could be trying to avoid repetitive movements that that cause pain. And using medications such as Advil and Tylenol and doing strengthening and stretching exercises, which you can learn from a physiotherapist or or on your own as well. And also other things that that the medial side of the elbow that it could be is an ulnar ligament injury. Um or yeah, or the other thing to be considering is and ulnar ligament injury and so if the pain isn't going away, then we might consider an ultrasound or something to look at the structures there.
PATIENT: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.
