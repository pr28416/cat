PATIENT: No, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: OK, and does anyone at home smoke?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: OK, well, those were all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions of your own?
PATIENT: Yeah, no, I was just really worried like, the grunting is just really scaring us. So do you, I was just wondering if you know what it could be.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so the grunting is worrisome. He could have anything from bronchiolitis to pneumonia so what we'll do is, we'll, first get his temperature, we'll get his O2 sat and we will get some imaging done as well to see if it's more in line with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. If it's bronchiolitis, it will be supportive treatment so we can keep him here at the hospital because he is in some distress and we'll keep him hydrated and give him some oxygen. And if it's pneumonia, we'll prescribe him some antibiotics. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, and will he need to stay in the hospital at all?
DOCTOR: Yeah so for now, because, if he is in any distress and if he needs oxygen, and IV hydration, he'll need to stay in the hospital until he's better from that standpoint. I should also mention, we should do a covid swab on him as well because his symptoms are in line with covid as well, so we'll have to do that to rule it out.
PATIENT: OK, yeah, that sounds good, Uh, uh, yeah, thank you so much.
DOCTOR: Yeah, no worries.
