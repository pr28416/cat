PATIENT: He's getting the shaft I think.
DOCTOR: Do you think?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you think they told him to not come in?
PATIENT: Well not only that but you know it's not all his fault man.  We need an offense to do anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know.  And then once the doc tells you you can't go in, you ain't going in and you know.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] not to you know.
DOCTOR: You don't think he kinda limped out a little bit?
PATIENT: Well yeah he did I think, I mean I do, but maybe next year.
DOCTOR: I just don't like his attitude.
PATIENT: Well he bums everybody out you know.
DOCTOR: That's the problem.
PATIENT: He sat on that bench and pissed everyone off, you know.
DOCTOR: You know and that's not a good quarterback.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: That's not a member of the team.  Deep breath, breathe out, breathe in, again.  Good.  Lay back for me.  You don't notice any water in your legs or anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: All in all, he just, you can sit up.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: I just don't like his attitude.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].  You know he's shown that a few times already too you know.  That's where uh.
DOCTOR: And then he thinks he's getting the shaft but I think part of the time the problem [REDACTED] by the way he carries himself.
PATIENT: Yeah I mean they say he's soft but I don't know where the ACL is in the knee, I imagine it hurts.
DOCTOR: Yeah but, Roethlisberger played on a broken foot.
PATIENT: Yeah I mean look at all [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: NAME would have come in with his arm in a sling okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: Then they really messed up when they put that second quarterback NAME.  They should have put NAME in for him.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um.
PATIENT: But the offense really sucks; we got to get an offense.
DOCTOR: Are you still smoking?
PATIENT: A little bit yeah, I'm down to less than, well about a pack a day now.
DOCTOR: So what, what do you want?  Do you a patch or do you want the gum or do you want?
PATIENT: I can't chew gum I got dentures.
DOCTOR: How about the patch?
PATIENT: The patch I tried but it didn't work.  [REDACTED].  You said you wanted to give me two of them [REDACTED].  I'd probably be able to do this on my own.
DOCTOR: Well let me know which do you want, do you want to try to do it yourself and then if it doesn't work let me know?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Let's do that, you know I'm managing to quit all my other shit and.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let's do that.
PATIENT: I'm down, I mean I was smoking about 2 1/2 packs and I'm down to.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.  About a pack, little less than a pack a day now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I can't smoke at home cause my girls won't let me smoke in the house.
DOCTOR: Those are good girls.
PATIENT: Other than that, I don’t know, everything has been okay.
DOCTOR: Your labs are back and your liver function is a little high, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You when I talked to NAME she said I got a little bit of scarring on there.
DOCTOR: Yeah you do.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: It is going up [REDACTED] 120, 130.  One the enzymes in your liver.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So you know.
PATIENT: Is it still going up now?
DOCTOR: Yeah the last time they checked it was in June of 10 and it was 120 and now January @@ it's 159, so.
PATIENT: That's not good huh?
DOCTOR: Not great but I mean the rest of your liver enzymes look pretty good.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So that's good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] quit drinking.
DOCTOR: Yeah it is.  Hang on, so we'll see.  We'll see what they say.  Let me go check with my attending real quick uh.
PATIENT: So you think you are going to get hold of Mental Health or am I?
DOCTOR: I think you are.
PATIENT: I need to go downstairs to I think don't I.  So I can make an appointment with them.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] Agent Orange [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh yeah, well years ago back in the 70s I was tested down in Arkansas and I had but now they don't take it anymore do they?
DOCTOR: I’m sorry?
PATIENT: They don't, there's no claim for it anymore and they don't test for it anymore do they?
DOCTOR: They don't?
PATIENT: Not that I know of.  Cause I've always wanted to fight them on that cause my daughter's missing her five fingers on her one hand.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay let me go ask him about the Mental Health and the meloxicam.
PATIENT: Okay doc.
DOCTOR: And [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Sure.
(DOCTOR OUT:  52:04  DOCTOR IN:  60:35)
DOCTOR: Hey, okay.  So well this is done.
PATIENT: What's that the meloxicam shit, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: In your knee?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It can be.  So here's what [REDACTED].  We could do [REDACTED] I think you should probably see PT again for your knee because strengthening the muscles surrounding your knee is the best way to support your knee and decrease the pain um.  You saw them once before right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: When was the last time, it's been a while ago right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Would you be interested in doing that or no?
PATIENT: He told me, I mean he told me exercises [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Because putting in a new kneecap is [REDACTED] specialist.
DOCTOR: So what do you think?
PATIENT: Uh I guess I'll give it a try.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So I'll do PT and then have you ever tried that capsaicin cream?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Has it worked for you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Not at all?  How long did you use it for?  You should give it about a month for it to work.
PATIENT: Oh yea?  No only used it for a couple of weeks.
DOCTOR: Do you want to try it again?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: And the problem is that after like month beyond this, the next thing we do is Vicodin or like narcotics and someone with your history.
PATIENT: They don't want to give me Vicodin.
DOCTOR: But you know what I mean that's the problem.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know we're kind of running into a brick wall.
PATIENT: Yeah that's fine.  I mean I can deal with it.  The only thing is it's hard getting up and down.
DOCTOR: Well I'll write you for capsaicin, I'll write you for meloxicam again I'll just refill it.  The trazodone I'm going to let the Mental Health and you’re good to go see them and you need to make an appointment, it's been less than two years since you've seen them, so just call.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So you need to call.
PATIENT: GI guys.
DOCTOR: GI guys and.

DOCTOR: Mental Health and Liver is going to make your appointment for you.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And then I will put in the lipid profile and CBC in the computer.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And um get those when you've been fasting for 12 hours so that we can do those to check a cholesterol.  So.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Oh give blood okay.
DOCTOR: Blood.  So those will be in the computer next time you're around. Get those done. And then um that's it.
PATIENT: Cool.
