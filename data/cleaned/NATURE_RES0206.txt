DOCTOR: What brings you in today?
PATIENT: So I so I have COPD and it's usually like pretty manageable with my puffers and that. But just in the last like 3 days I feel like it's gotten a lot worse. You know, I, I feel like I'm coughing more often and I'm now, uh, kind of producing more sputum. Kind of like a green yellowy sputum uhm. I even notice that there is like a little bit of blood a couple times when I was like, really coughing hard. I’ve been finding it like harder to breathe than usual. I don’t have home oxygen or anything, and I'm not. I didn't think I was quite there yet, but this these last few days it's been. It's been really hard to breathe.

DOCTOR: OK, and has this ever happened to you before?
PATIENT: I’ve had I had some troubles like when I've been sick before where the cough is gotten pretty bad. This is probably this is probably the worst that I've had, but I have like I have had in my COPD been made worse by being sick.
DOCTOR: I see OK. Well, I guess the first thing we're going. So how's tbad, how bad is your shortness of breath?

DOCTOR: OK, uh, alright, well I guess one more question, are there any lung diseases or heart conditions or cancers that run in the family?
PATIENT: No, nothing that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Alright, well that's those are all the questions I had for you. I will now do it physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest. It's likely that what you have right now is COPD exacerbation, maybe just a like an infection that you got, which worsened some of your COPD symptoms. We would also have to rule out covid, so we'll be doing a covid swab and will decide based on the on your labs in your vital signs. It's instead of other things whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted, or if you are good to go home, I will also talk to my attending and will make those decisions together and come back and talk to you. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Your welcome.
