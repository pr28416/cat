DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Oh yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah, follow me.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] me.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Grand Central Station here.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh I'm doing alright.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm sort of getting all hospitalized out, [REDACTED] hospitals.  Research projects, University of Illinois and uh I was upstairs for two days as an inpatient just to get a spinal tap.
DOCTOR: Okay for what?
PATIENT: Okay, well I got the spinal tap, I'm out of breath just give me a second.  I got the spinal tap uh because uh my neurologist DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh felt it would be useful in determining and I'm speaking as a civilian non-medical person, the uh nature of my neuropathy I have uh bilateral sensory polyneuropathy.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: In both legs and it's crawling up to, in fact I just noticed last night, it's like pretty very close to my knees, right next to my knees, although it's not 100% that high but what Iâ€™m trying to say is I've got neuropathy in the feet and legs and uh since 1998 and that is when she first diagnosed it.  Then uh I'm also worried about the fact that I have it, I'm just going to take a while just to say about, I've lost about 40% of the feeling in my hands, maybe more.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I've also got edema, I've got gout in the right wrist and I've got edema which is causing all these marks which are called [REDACTED] disease.
DOCTOR: So why did they do the tap?
PATIENT: Well to find the nature of my neuropathy.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: See if they can determine uh what is causing it or whatever.  Now that was last Tuesday finally, I had a successful spinal tap.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: The first two attempts were not good uh by DOCTOR.  He was brand new; I don't think he had done them before.  If I heard him correctly.  And then uh your doctor in Interventional Radiology with an Armenian name, [REDACTED] he did it in Radiology Tuesday of last week.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um I don't want to uh, it's not fair for me to bother you I suppose.  Is there any remarkable comment by the uh, by the radiologist or I mean yeah by the radiologist relating to the uh?
DOCTOR: Done here?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's the spinal tap here in Radiology.  I'm just curious if there's anything that stands out as a result of that spinal tap or whatever, the lumbar or whatever it is.
DOCTOR: When was it?
PATIENT: It was last Tuesday, let's see today is what like the 29th?
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: So it would have been the 20, am I right in saying yeah the 22nd, 22nd of September.
DOCTOR: And the culture was negative.
PATIENT: The culture was negative?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: For anything disastrous. Or anything deleterious as they say.  Nothing relating to Agent Orange or dioxin or anything of that sort I'm sure.  I think dioxin could only be, so I understand that it can only be found to [REDACTED] blood [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: From what I can find here, so far it just a negative.  There are some things that are pending.
PATIENT: Oh still pending okay.  Now I'll mention one other important thing that's happened just recently.  In fact Friday um now, when I was in the hospital for the spinal tap they gave me blood tests for other miscellaneous things here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um and then I got a call last Friday from your, I don't know the exactly you know the TeleNurse or whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Telephone Nurse, whatever that is.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And she said I'm calling about your high blood pressure and your diabetes okay.  Now I've never been formerly diagnosed by any doctor with diabetes okay.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Um now, I did have a high glucose level about six, you know six or eight weeks ago here okay.  Very high, it was like after I'd eaten a lot of cherries you know okay.
DOCTOR: How high?
PATIENT: It was like 175 I believe.
DOCTOR: After eating?
PATIENT: After eating a lot of sweet cherries.
DOCTOR: Uh huh.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now the point is, was something found.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh 10 days ago or there about, not eight days ago, from the blood tests that were taken relating to uh whether I have been recently diagnosed by anybody with having diabetes?
DOCTOR: As far as I can find here no.  So I don't know who called you or why or.
PATIENT: Well it was the nurse.  It was the Tele whatever it is and that's what she says.
DOCTOR: From here, from the VA?
PATIENT: From the VA here and uh they call after a patient has been an inpatient you know.
DOCTOR: Everything's [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And I said is this formal notification that I've been diagnosed with diabetes and she said no and she wanted to get off the telephone quickly.  She didn't want to deal with the problem you know.
DOCTOR: Did you end up getting the follow-up colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Uh I had a colonoscopy roughly, I'm gonna say you know, seven or eight months ago okay.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I had at least 13 polyps taken out.  I'm like a polyp farm you know.  I had like 13 polyps taken out.  Now uh in two previous colonoscopies and let's just say the last three years, in two that were six months apart I had lots of polyps taken out.  I'm gonna say um you know 13 or 14 or something on that order and the thing that sort of worries me is that my next follow-up colonoscopy is not for three years from the date of the last one okay, which would have been.
DOCTOR: Who told you that?
PATIENT: That's the letter that I got from the GI Clinic that said it would be three years okay.  Now they said if I have any questions call the clinic and the recording said someone will get back to me within a day and a half or two days or something.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: No one ever got back to me um and uh the reason I called is because if they're taking out you know two dozen polyps over a short period of time pretty much, the question becomes should I wait three years for the next colonoscopy?
DOCTOR: Yes.  Yes.
PATIENT: Well the reason, the only reason I say that is because um when 2 1/2, 3 years ago when I had a colonoscopy and they took a lot of them out.  I forget the exact number.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It might have been seven or six or something I called and talked with a GI doctor.  At that time I was successful in talking with the GI doctor after the polyps were taken out and I said my next colonoscopy isn't planned for several years, you know based on the number of polyps they've taken out in the last two times uh should I wait that long.  He said you know you're right, you should not wait several years you should have one soon, which I had; I'm just going to guestimate about one year later or less.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay.  Um so you know I'm willing to go along with whatever you think.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: But just keep in mind, the last time 13 polyps.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.  I'm just so, you're thinking even if I get a lot of polyps, they're not gonna be necessarily cancerous within three years but the odds are fairly low, that's probably what you're saying.
DOCTOR: Um well the uh it always depends on the pathology.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um if any more than.
PATIENT: There's one flat polyp recently that whatever, you know I don't know the technical names.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well there was one flat polyp which I understand are more dangerous.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So.
PATIENT: There was one, the rest were what are they called plastic polyps or something?
DOCTOR: Hyperplastic
PATIENT: Whatever they are yeah.
DOCTOR: So when was the last gout flare you had?
PATIENT: Oh yeah well, depending on whatever your definition is, I three or four or five times I've felt a gout flare-up starting on my right wrist which it was diagnosed about a year and a half ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I had two flare-ups then.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I had.
DOCTOR: Are you taking anything?
PATIENT: What starts as flare-ups but and it actually sort of went into gout probably.
DOCTOR: Are you taking allopurinol or?
PATIENT: I sure am, every other day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But uh I haven't had a long, I had actually weeks, I've had a couple of instances of not being really able to lift things with my right arm because of the gout but it didn't last, it only lasts a week or so.
DOCTOR: Are you still taking the Coumadin or are you on aspirin?
PATIENT: No I'm on aspirin therapy.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I was on Coumadin for several years for a-fib.
DOCTOR: So why did they stop the Coumadin?
PATIENT: Well I lost, believe it or not, when I had my left toe and the first ray of my foot amputated December 7th, following that I've lost, believe it or not, at least four and maybe five pints of blood which were replaced both here in this hospital and at St. Francis Hospital where I was brought, the same within 12 hours after I went to the nursing home.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I was taken to St. Francis Hospital from the nursing home, I lost several pints of blood and I was given several pints of blood at St. Francis Hospital in Evanston.  Uh I was given blood here, maybe one or two pints that I lost through the toe.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah.
PATIENT: That had been amputated so uh the podiatrist left me on the Coumadin while I had the surgery.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I think probably because they feel they can tie off the foot so that it won't bleed during surgery.
DOCTOR: Yeah but.
PATIENT: So I'm not sure they were thinking too much about post surgery.
DOCTOR: Uh are you still cathing yourself?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Eight to ten times a day.  I've probably done it 20,000 times, literally 20,000 times.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] still?
PATIENT: Uh every six months or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: I still have an atonic bladder.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's the main reason and also another name for it.
DOCTOR: And you're still taking your vitamin B12 supplement?
PATIENT: Yes I'm due in fact to take it tomorrow, uh the B12.  I shoot the B12 with whatever you call it.
DOCTOR: Okay and then you're still seeing the kidney doctors?
PATIENT: The what doctors?
DOCTOR: Kidney.
PATIENT: Um I have an appointment for November 1st, I'm gonna try to get in even sooner.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh just to check the status of my uh.
DOCTOR: So you're taking Tylenol, allopurinol, amlodipine uh aspirin, uh calcitriol.
PATIENT: What's the last one you said?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: For your [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh yes by the way does it show, does that is still active as far as you can see there?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Or you know.
DOCTOR: The diltiazem.
PATIENT: I take that every other day.
DOCTOR: Diltiazem.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Finasteride, [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yep, yep.
DOCTOR: Folic acid?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Lasix, the furosemide.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Do you do 1 1/2 tablets twice a day?
PATIENT: That's correct.
DOCTOR: Um gabapentin?
PATIENT: Yes uh yes.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] bedtime.
PATIENT: Uh yes, it's very odd.  As you can see, in fact I even quit that for quite a while off and on because it makes me fall asleep during the day so DOCTOR said well just try to take it when you go to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: When you're trying to get to sleep.
DOCTOR: Um lisinopril?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Half a tablet.
PATIENT: Half a tablet twice a day.
DOCTOR: And metoprolol?
PATIENT: Yes two.
DOCTOR: Twice a day.
PATIENT: Two tablets, one tablet twice a day.
DOCTOR: Yes.  Uh and then the thiamine.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Anything else?
PATIENT: Those are, that's.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You've got the, what was that?
DOCTOR: That's pretty much it?
PATIENT: Yeah that's pretty much it yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So.
PATIENT: So uh so you didn't glance at anything uh I [REDACTED] want to take this boot off, I'd be happy to.
DOCTOR: Pretty swollen.
PATIENT: Oh yeah that's been the big problem.
DOCTOR: The swelling?
PATIENT: My uh you know a couple of months ago I was sent by Podiatry to a local prosthetics place.  They gave me a diabetic shoe to be fitted because I have ulcers.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they're now very close to being healed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But what's stopping the healing or hurting me is the what do you call the edema.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Which I had, in fact the very day, the very day I went to the prosthetics place near my home.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh my feet and legs swell up.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: With edema and you know I'm coming on to my non-medical opinion.
DOCTOR: Deep breath for me okay.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths.  Any fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Uh I, every three months, including about two weeks ago I had uh, I had uh chills.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: What felt like and I had a small fever.  It's every three months or so I get that and it lasts usually you know about eight or ten hours overnight and then it goes away. Iâ€™ve always suspected in my non-medical way that it has something to do with my kidney disease which I have.  At one time I just, maybe stage five kidney disease and then they got my blood pressure under control and I went back to stage three.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now it's probably lingering around stage four.
DOCTOR: Any uh vomiting, diarrhea?
PATIENT: Uh no I'm pretty good.
DOCTOR: Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No except, except blood, I was diagnosed here and when I had the colonoscopy as internal hemorrhoids of the anus.
DOCTOR: Um do you need refills of your medications today?
PATIENT: Uh the only thing, I'll being going there, I don't think you would have to worry about this.  Uh except to say one thing, I'm going over, there's a lady who takes care of catheters.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I can't remember her name.  She has a real odd name uh I'll be seeing her today to get a renewal.  As long as I have a renewal, I'd like renewals left on my catheters that you might be able to notice there and on my lube gel, the gel that is used with catheters.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Did you notice?  That's the one thing I'm concerned about.
DOCTOR: You have six refills on the lubricant jelly.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then 11 refills.
PATIENT: On catheters?
DOCTOR: 10 refills.
PATIENT: Oh that's good.  Now there's only one other quick thing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: A doctor, I'm trying to remember, oh you know what it was he was a hematologist.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I was discussing briefly with him about three weeks ago, thereabouts roughly, uh the uh diabetes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh.
DOCTOR: You don't have any.
PATIENT: Well apparently not.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Okay uh by the way can I bother, do you recall what my glucose was, I assume they took my glucose like 10 days ago when I was here in the hospital for the spinal tap?
DOCTOR: The last glucose was 82.
PATIENT: 82?  About ten days ago or something like that?
DOCTOR: On the 21st.
PATIENT: No, did you say the 21st, yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: No kidding?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Well that's great right.
DOCTOR: No you're good.  Your kidneys are looking good, everything is.
PATIENT: Well my kidneys, believe first of all my left kidney I was told two years ago is dead.  It's atrophied and now other doctors have said well maybe it's not quite dead but it's near its.
DOCTOR: Yeah but you don't have diabetes though.
PATIENT: Oh yeah well that's the best news I've had all day.  I was just gonna ask one question.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Remember I said like the hematologist.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Hematologist I got on the subject of diabetes.  He said the next time you have a blood test; it would be good to have what you call the A.
DOCTOR: A1c.
PATIENT: I think it was an A1c.
DOCTOR: You had it last year.
PATIENT: I had one last year.
DOCTOR: In May and it was fine.
PATIENT: It was okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh do you have 5.9 or something like that yeah okay so and plus what you're telling me about the 21st is good news.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I don't.
DOCTOR: They checked your sugars and they were all fine.
PATIENT: Yeah he said the next time I had blood tests to get an A1c but that was before the good news that you just told me about that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: No your sugars look fine.  I doubt really that much would be new.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Now I'll be seeing the Renal on November 1st.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'll be seeing, I'll be getting the results of the spinal tap.  I'm going to make an appointment for an EMG.  I think it's for getting the results of the spinal tap.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  39:53  DOCTOR IN:  53:31)
DOCTOR: Um when do you follow up with Neurology again?
PATIENT: I do not haveâ€¦ I'm about to make an appointment in the next 20 minutes.  I believe they're working the floors right now in the hospital.
DOCTOR: You don't need any refills or you do?
PATIENT: I don't believe I need refills but the only thing I would ask of you is see, you know I probably won't be back here until you tell me, it's three, four, five, six months.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now if that's the case do you see anything on there?  Is it difficult for you to decide if uh let's say I need additional what do you call it, um you know, additional refills on especially for instance blood pressure medication?
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Is it hard to make that out?  I'm gonna take a wild guess and say it's gonna be closer to six months that I probably would not be back here unless you indicate differently.
DOCTOR: Um I was going to say four months.
PATIENT: Uh-huh sure that would be great uh.
DOCTOR: Um let's see.
PATIENT: Something's always coming up.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: As long as I've got enough to get me through, let's say four months.  If it seems like I do, terrific but.
DOCTOR: You can always call.
PATIENT: Yeah that's, yeah.  That can be a little problematical but that's okay.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: For your swelling, for the next three days.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Instead of doing 1 1/2 of the furosemide.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Do the full two tablets.
PATIENT: Okay, alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: For three days only.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Starting tomorrow.
PATIENT: I suspect.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That they, you know, by the way I'm like it's always difficult to tell with me when I have active [REDACTED] which I've had in the past.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Um uh and so what I'm trying to get at is you know a lot of the swelling might have been, started with you know active [REDACTED] fluid or something which they indicated.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: In the last few months.
DOCTOR: It's hard to say that it's that or if your kidneys or if it's.
PATIENT: Yeah, right, exactly.  However, uh my suspicion based upon only, my non-medical suspicion.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Non-medically trained suspicion is that uh you know I read an article recently that said you know uh edema is sometimes caused by inactivity and in my particular case you know the podiatrist you know uh seemed happiest when I simply had my feet up and I'm not really getting, because I had ulcers on the toes you know the remaining toes that I have.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh they're happiest when I'm not doing a lot of walking.  So that's what I suspect is a large part of the problem.
DOCTOR: Do you check your...
PATIENT: So I'll be seeing them very soon, I have two appointments to make today.  One is with the uh.
DOCTOR: The foot doctor.
PATIENT: Is the foot doctor and one is with.
DOCTOR: Neurologist.
PATIENT: Neurologist yes.
DOCTOR: Good yeah so I mean so far youâ€™re doing [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But you don't think I should wait three years to follow up with the colonoscopy?
DOCTOR: Well we can talk next time, you're still not due.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: You just had one.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: Okay.  I'm uh.
DOCTOR: Right now you're good.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm just a little worried.  My father died of colon cancer and my mother seemed to have had it.
DOCTOR: Okay, next time you come we can go over the whole pathology.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] exactly what they found.
PATIENT: Well I may, what I've been really putting off is that I may call the GI doctors.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Again and just see.
DOCTOR: See what they say.
PATIENT: And just reset that one.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Alright so uh.
DOCTOR: But you're doing good, you're doing good.
PATIENT: Oh that's great.
DOCTOR: Um depending what they find on the results of the lumbar puncture.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Then, neuro - I'm guessing you'll see Neurology by that time and they can see if there's anything you need for the different [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  My overwhelming and key thing right now is my kidneys you know and.
DOCTOR: And [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And maybe I'm gonna need dialysis.
DOCTOR: Dialysis, very true.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Have a great day okay.
PATIENT: Thank you for putting up with me, I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: No problem.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: 58:43.
