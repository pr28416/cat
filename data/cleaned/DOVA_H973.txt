SECOND PERSON H973
He sounds kind of wheezy.
DOCTOR: Yeah he does, when he came in here.
PATIENT: And that's, and that's what I know I've got asthma.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I don't got anything at home now but before whenever I got an asthma attack I'd go to the hospital, now I got a, what do you call it?
DOCTOR: A nebulizer.
PATIENT: A nebulizer.
DOCTOR: How often are you having to use that?
PATIENT: Well, when I get to the point where the medications aren't helping I go to the nebulizer and that helps it right away.
DOCTOR: How many times a week do you think you've been using that regularly?
SECOND PERSON H973
Um the last time he used it was in November.
DOCTOR: Oh excellent, oh good.  Okay good.
SECOND PERSON H973
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That tells me that the daily medications, cause the way that we treat this is try to get the daily medications to make you so you don't need the rescue medication.
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So um sounds like you're in a good place.  This season is trouble.
PATIENT: It is.
DOCTOR: Cause a lot of patients with um asthma or COPD.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Your airway is hyperreactive so if there's, if someone would get a little sniffle, from an allergy or a cold or whatever, it's gonna hang out and be a lot longer than it would with the next guy.
PATIENT: Okay, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um so I can deal with you being a little wheezy as long as you feel like you can walk around and you're not using the rescue inhaler too much.
PATIENT: Well I been waiting for the one [REDACTED] hibernating for the year.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: I couldn't get out during the wintertime.
DOCTOR: Yeah.

PATIENT: Not lately but I've been very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The trouble is that if I'm walking my back, is real bad.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause when I get that pain on my back it's just, I have to fall and that's the only way that I could fall.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have to be careful cause when I get the feeling I want to pull up and grab something.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because it's, I'm just pretty sure it's something I have.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If there's nothing to hold on to.
DOCTOR: Yeah we got to be careful.

PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You're not on Warfarin and you have a filter?
PATIENT: Now I got a filter.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Past medical history otherwise, we talked about the asthma, COPD and I read about you, so correct me if I’m wrong, the [REDACTED] which is a pretty rare disease.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I've never seen that.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] is worse.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It's just a vasculitis thing but it's just not that common.
PATIENT: What is it?
DOCTOR: It's in the vasculitis family, it has to do with the blood clots but it's pretty rare, pretty rare.  Um other things that you have, you've had colon cancer in the past.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Is that correct? Okay.  Um they diagnosed you with an iron deficiency anemia when you were last in the hospital.
PATIENT: You know, I've had, the regular doctor, my private doctor that I’ve had for years.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: When I [REDACTED] VA for my private physician.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I didn't drop him cause I've had him for over [REDACTED] years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] he knows me more.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: But he always told me, are you losing any blood anywhere.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I said why.  He said your blood work always shows you.
DOCTOR: A little anemic.
PATIENT: Yeah a little anemic and he knows about it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh the reason I got to [REDACTED] little concern.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean we worry, so when were you diagnosed with the colon cancer?
PATIENT: '89.
DOCTOR: Okay so you sometimes that's an early symptom of colon cancer and I don't know how yours presented but sometimes people will come in with this kind of slow bleed.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] actually I happened to be, I retired that year.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: From the job and I went in to see him, having an appointment and I said doctor I noticed some blood in my stool today.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: This morning and he said well I want you to send you to the Lab for some tests.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: He sent me to, you know I had lab there at the clinic and he sent me there and they didn't find anything [REDACTED] He said I don’t trust [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They sent me for the lab down there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Good thing he did.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause they found the cancer.
DOCTOR: Um did you have a surgery to remove [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I have an incision from here to here.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Did you have to have a bag at some point?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Did they connect.
PATIENT: No the doctor said that you’re lucky that we found it in time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  I don't [REDACTED] how long it is and that would have to be in the records to look um.  Are you having any blood in the stool or black tarry stools now?
PATIENT: You know what happened, I don't know maybe about three years ago I got up during the night, maybe 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning and I went to the toilet and I had something like diarrhea and I looked down and it was all blood.
DOCTOR: And that was three years ago.
PATIENT: About three years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay then what happened?
PATIENT: I went upstairs and I called [REDACTED], you got to get up; I got to go to the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She took me to St. Joseph.
DOCTOR: Did they do a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: They did a lot of stuff.
DOCTOR: What was the diagnosis?
PATIENT: They, that's when they found the uh.
SECOND PERSON H973
[REDACTED] [Shear Shaw?].
DOCTOR: Oh that was when they found [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay wow, okay well yeah so I mean there's a couple explanations.  The fact that you had a colonoscopy as recent as three years ago I'm pretty confident that it's not a recurring colon cancer coming back.
PATIENT: Well they.
DOCTOR: Colon cancer takes ten years to develop.  That's why we say when you turn 50 get one.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: That's how long it takes the polyps to become a cancer.
PATIENT: But they.
DOCTOR: The only thing, I'm sorry.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: The other thing is that the [REDACTED] if they found little blood vessels, sometimes you just get here and there you know if you're on prednisone, they’re not going to fix, you could be bleeding still from that.  The other thing is I don't know exactly what they took out.  Iron is absorbed in the far part of the small bowel, near to the colon right where the appendix is.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So sometimes you see colectomies and they end up taking a part of the small bowel [REDACTED].  So that's kind of three good reasons why you might be a little anemic.  But as long as you're not getting dizzy, you're not having chest pain, your blood count's really not that low, kind of low grade anemia.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I'm not super worried about it.  Um the other thing I wanted to do is, they diagnosed you with an iron deficiency but they didn't look to see how much iron the body stored up.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: I'd like to see that cause sometimes when people have things like [REDACTED], any kind of disease, your body stockpiles iron.
PATIENT: And you know what.
DOCTOR: Cause it doesn't want the blood [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] keeps repeating.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] then every year now it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Where I all of a sudden have breathing and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they look at one thing and by the time they started looking in there, there's no place, they can't find the location.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: It could be [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Inside my intestine.
DOCTOR: Yeah cause those [REDACTED] and they're real annoying to try to find cause they'll bleed for a little bit then they'll stop.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: And they're not able to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well I guess we're just gonna have to keep an eye on it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I know it's gonna happen again.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I've had that every year for the last three years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H973
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Probably gonna happen again unless you give me something to stop it.
DOCTOR: Well we'll give you iron to get your blood storage up.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED] iron.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Anything else bothering you aside from the anemia?
PATIENT: I'm very weak.  Cause I've been home.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I lost my appetite.  I lost, once I was 175 pounds, I'm down to 167 pounds.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean I love to eat.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And she'll take me, I like to eat at restaurants.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So we eat out a lot.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I get my favorite food.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What's your favorite foods?
PATIENT: Anything with grease and fat in it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON H973
Anything that's fried.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Does he live with you?
SECOND PERSON H973
Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, alright.  Um well that's kind of a vague complaint.  Sometimes when you're your age um being in the hospital can also take you out um.
PATIENT: Usually when I go to the hospital when I didn't know if I was going to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it's bothering me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: To the point where I've been losing sleep and I keep thinking, it's not worth it, is this it?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Your diabetes panel was really low.  Um that can't really explain about the stabbing sort of pain you get.  You might have back spasms, a lot of people do have.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Arthritis and stuff but I'm really happy that you're not, that you know come [REDACTED], I don't want you falling down or anything. That makes me really nervous.
PATIENT: You know I had stones in my bladder?
SECOND PERSON H973
Gallbladder.
DOCTOR: Oh that's okay.
PATIENT: And they, that would be they scheduled me for surgery at St. Josephs’s and I talked to the surgery and [REDACTED] diet and medications.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And he never called me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So instead my doctor gave me enough medications to resolve the stones.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  Generally with gallstones if they don't bother you they don't bother us as a general rule and like you're right a surgeon never wants somebody to go into surgery if they're not gonna definitely feel better afterwards.
PATIENT: And the fact that he couldn't go in, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh it was laparoscopic?
PATIENT: Yeah, he couldn't do that.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: But he said he had to go in because of the cancer surgery.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: And they had to go in and open it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But my doctor didn't want to do it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh and.
SECOND PERSON H973
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: I have to tell you one other thing because that's a couple of years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh I know I've been that way for years and I just couldn't take it.
DOCTOR: Is this gallbladder pain?
PATIENT: Once in a while I get a little pain.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And you know they said well if it goes to the back then you've got to worry about it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you're supposed to go to the shoulder.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So I wouldn't worry about that.  If you start getting fevers and chills and sweats that’s when we worry.
PATIENT: Oh that, okay.
DOCTOR: Because something could get infected but again if they don't bother you they don't bother me.
PATIENT: Well can you give me that prescription? I need the prescriptions.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah I usually call it in for the first thing but the number on there [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah this is for the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  That's all I got.
DOCTOR: Oh for your blood sugars?
PATIENT: I need refills you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I need to get them.
DOCTOR: Do you get them here?
PATIENT: They um get them from the outside so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The only other time that I came in here uh that was to the hospital and they gave them to me.
DOCTOR: Okay they gave you these kinds and they worked?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay cause they contract with of course one glucometer maker, one you know what I mean.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: There are about a billion glucometer makers.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I want to make sure.
PATIENT: I don't know if the VA gave me that or the [REDACTED].  But I think I might as well today from here.
DOCTOR: Yeah absolutely.
SECOND PERSON H973
Cause we don’t know, the machine itself.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Let me just make sure it's compatible you know.  I should be able to look it up.  Do you like it to go to your house or do you want to pick it up at the window?
PATIENT: No I better pick it up cause that's all I have.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Both medications I have to pick up.
DOCTOR: Okay you've been on this for a while right?
PATIENT: Both of them.
DOCTOR: Okay just to make your co-pay simpler I'll give you a 90 day supply.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: With three refills and then I'll see you in six months but I'll give you my card and everything if you need to see me before then.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um.
SECOND PERSON H973
So you'll still be here in six months?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.
DOCTOR: I know, we change you know cause this is like our apprenticeship.  I've been in medical school and I have an MD and all that stuff but um I'm getting tweaked you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I always practice under somebody which is good.
PATIENT: Actually yeah they're recording me, the conversation.
DOCTOR: Oh really?  Did they tell you?
PATIENT: Yeah it's in my jacket I don't even know if you can [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh that's good to know.
PATIENT: If it picks it up.
DOCTOR: They've been doing it.  I mean that's really funny.
PATIENT: That's why I told you that you're going be on Candid Camera.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah I wondered.  So you only have precision um not free style, you know what I mean so I don't know if they're gonna be compatible.
PATIENT: It's the same thing all over yeah.  Cause I.  You know what I could do is that I had that machine for years, I wonder if I could get a new one.
DOCTOR: Uh does it work okay?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's beginning to get a lot of errors on it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's like I was talking to someone the other day on the phone, they wanted to give me a new machine.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And she said you know those machines don't last forever.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it works for years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And you should think about replacing it.
DOCTOR: So what I'll do is, if you're concerned about it anyway it might be a good time just to give you the Precision brand strips to just give you a Precision machine.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: So we can give you that.  Other medications I have you on, let's see here.
PATIENT: We got a list.
DOCTOR: Oh good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] came out of the hospital.

DOCTOR: So I'll make sure you have plenty of refills on this.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: For six months.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um when you came out of the hospital they said that your magnesium and it was really low.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: When it came so that can cause sometimes a cramping in the legs and a sensation of weakness.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: The magnesium I don't want to keep you too long on it.
PATIENT: Could you give me for my cramps I used to [REDACTED] and they used to give me, what was it, uh some kind of medication for cramps.
DOCTOR: Oh I don't know that could be anything.
PATIENT: It was called, I can't remember, but I used to keep a supply of it all the time and I haven’t had any like you said the reason why I get cramps in the legs.

DOCTOR: Did you want that today too?
PATIENT: We have enough.
SECOND PERSON H973

DOCTOR: I'll make sure you have plenty so you know call us about two weeks before you run out.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: But I'll look through all the medications and make sure you have enough refills.
SECOND PERSON H973

DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H973
Cause those, your blood pressure ones you only have one more refill.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Now are you having any chest pain or shortness of breath?  I know, well you told me a little bit about that.
PATIENT: Yeah I had a little bit of it, like I say it came back again but it's not as severe like it was before.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Is this the same kind of chest pain?
PATIENT: Yeah.  It's not a pain it's like, it's kind of like I'm running out of breath.
DOCTOR: Like a tightening you said is the word you used yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah I feel like it's, it's a good thing that it’s a gradual thing.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You've had no blood in your stool?
PATIENT: My stomach has always been bad and I've got all kinds of medications for that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you moving your bowels okay [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah but I have to take something for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's okay.
PATIENT: That they gave me.
DOCTOR: As long as we got you to a good place.
PATIENT: Dark black stools are caused by the medications.
DOCTOR: The iron.
PATIENT: The iron.
DOCTOR: Yeah iron will tend to bind you up too so make sure you're taking the stool softener.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Any trouble passing water?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Good okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay and you said before you feel like your legs are gonna go out you feel it, you can grab yourself.  You're not falling down or passing out?
PATIENT: No, no, no.  Not, [REDACTED].  If I get up in the middle of the night I got a lot of light from the street and from the alley.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My apartment is lit.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I do get up and walk to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: But I have to be very careful.
DOCTOR: Yeah definitely, definitely.
PATIENT: But usually I just take the walker.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um [REDACTED].  Good.  Let me just look.
PATIENT: I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It's a little red.  I'm going to just, go ahead and close your mouth, close your mouth.  [REDACTED].  It's a little red but it's not like, you know when little kids get strep throat and their tonsils get big and yucky, your’s is red.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Coughing at night? Do you feel post nasal [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No I thought it was [REDACTED].  It probably something [REDACTED] but mouth it could be just very dry.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that helps.
DOCTOR: Any pain going up this way?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I've seen a throat like that sometimes in patients that get sinus trouble.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's why I was asking you about a cough and stuff like that but of course with you having the asthma so who knows, you normally cough anyway right.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So it's gonna be hard to say.  The other thing is sometimes patients will get sensations of reflux.
PATIENT: I have reflux anyway.
DOCTOR: And that would also.
PATIENT: Well I got to get a refill of the reflux medication.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you having any trouble with reflux now?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay cause yeah usually a lot of patients.
SECOND PERSON H973
[REDACTED] he has [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's yeah.
PATIENT: I ran out of it, so I got to keep [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah so no even though it's fun to do that [REDACTED] on a full stomach usually three hours, wait about three hours um, things like chocolate will really irritate some people.  Some people will say that they have trouble with like tomato sauces but they can eat a fresh tomato without trouble.  Um alcohol of course.  A glass of red wine is good for you and even a beer once in a while is good for you, but too much alcohol [REDACTED].
PATIENT: What did you hear about my clot.
DOCTOR: What do you mean?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] left leg.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] left side, all the way up there when I was in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they were concerned about that because [REDACTED] clot on the bottom of the leg.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Wasn't bad but they said that would have to go up into your groin.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well usually most of the clots, so if you have clots in the legs they're gonna go to the lungs so those can kill you.  These can hurt, but those can kill you.  Most the clots actually form in the thigh here.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then they travel down and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But you have a filter in.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah so we just have to wait for your body to break down that clot naturally.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Sometimes when you have things like [REDACTED] and you have a lot of autoimmune diseases or you don't move around a lot, it's hard for your body to break those clots.
PATIENT: It's not [REDACTED] cause you're not going out you know and fall and break a leg.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So now I'm confined to the house.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I you know I had to get up and walk.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So haven't done anything like that, just inside the house.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I got a bicycle.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know.
SECOND PERSON H973
He hasn't really been alone since Thanksgiving.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON H973
Cause he caught a bad cold.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H973
And all winter he just couldn't get rid of it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H973
And he'd get a little better and then he'd get you know sick again.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON H973
A little better and then get real sick again.
PATIENT: I just haven't been myself.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: For the last couple months or more.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, doctor's order, that's a pretty good indication.  But yeah I think.  Cause that's a hard thing to really pinpoint you know.  Not feeling good like that.  I think um there are a couple of reasons pretty anemic, but you've been that anemic for a while so, you'd think your body would have adjusted.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I can hear you, like your daughter said, wheezing quite a bit so you might be hanging on to a cold.
PATIENT: I just got over it.
DOCTOR: A little longer.
PATIENT: Right.  I had a cold with the asthma.
DOCTOR: And what I don't like is the losing weight you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Well you know I think I've lost the weight because.
SECOND PERSON H973
How much did he weigh recently?
PATIENT: I'm starting.
SECOND PERSON H973
In the hospital.
PATIENT: When I was in the hospital I couldn't stand the food that they gave me for one thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I wasn't hungry either.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I went home and the same thing, even though I eat the favorite foods.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But what I'm saying but once [REDACTED] I force myself to eat it.
DOCTOR: In the hospital you weighed 167, so you've really only lost like three or four pounds which I mean can be you know, it's not really much.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But when you were telling me you used to be in the 170s, you've lost about 10 pounds.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON J257
I thinking [REDACTED] a while ago.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know.
PATIENT: And like I said because of my clothes, they say I could get ride of my old clothes [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You were 175 in November so I mean that's actually less than.
SECOND PERSON H973
Oh it was less than ten?
DOCTOR: Yeah it's about, I would say in about six months you lost about ten pounds.
PATIENT: 10 pounds.
DOCTOR: That's not so much where I really, really worry.
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But we ought to keep an eye on it okay and make sure you're getting good nutrition.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Also once the weather starts get up and get out and get moving.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We'll draw your labs today to make sure your electrolytes aren't out of whack and just to make sure you're not too anemic.
SECOND PERSON H973
He had breakfast.
DOCTOR: Oh that's fine, yeah.
SECOND PERSON H973
That doesn't matter?
DOCTOR: No that doesn't matter.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON H973
They can check the, what's that lab test the blood count?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SECOND PERSON H973
The iron, magnesium, potassium.
DOCTOR: So what I'm gonna check are the magnesium, potassium, do the panel where we check the kidney function level.
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna do that.  I'll check the blood count.  I'm not gonna check the iron level cause they checked that last time but I'm gonna check how the body stores of iron.
SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um because sometimes you know that can affect how much iron your body is able to use.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It's kind of hard to explain but um it actually when you have a lot of inflammation for one reason or the other the stored which [Sher Shaw?] [REDACTED] is enough to account for that.  Um our body automatically thinks we have an infection you know which is kind of actually if you have an infection, the bacteria just loves iron, that's what they live on.
SECOND PERSON H973
Hmm.
DOCTOR: So your body just kind of collects iron.  So sometimes we can see patients with really low iron in the blood, not because they're not getting it, not because they're not absorbing it, not because they're losing it but rather your body's trying to sequestering as a sort of as a protective mechanism because through evolution you know it's what used kill people, hundreds of years ago used to get infection right.
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Now we've gotten to the point where we've got antibiotics and all these things where you wash your hands but our body still thinks infection whenever there's a problem.
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we check the iron stores and the electrolytes.
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And we'll just make sure there's nothing reported in the blood count, make sure there's nothing out of whack.  I'll make sure I have a phone number to contact you.
SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so I'll let you know if there's any trouble.  Um we'll make sure you have enough refills, I'll see you in six months.  I'll give you my card you know so if you need to see me sooner and we'll give you, I already put in the ursodiol and your strips and the new monitor at the window.
SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.
DOCTOR: You should be able to pick those up whenever.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I'll need to take a listen to your heart and your lungs.
PATIENT: Oh, do you want me to get up there?
DOCTOR: On no you're okay there, that's fine.  With your mouth open deep breaths in.  Yeah you're kind of wheezy.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good.  Deep breath in for me.  Can you just sit up on the table for me so I can poke on your stomach?
SECOND PERSON H973
He woke up today feeling achy and it's just like he's coming down with a cold.  So that's probably what it is.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean, it's kind of the time for summer colds you know we're getting into that season where the summer viruses are coming.
SECOND PERSON H973
Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to interrupt I keep getting paged, I'm just gonna see who's paging me.  [REDACTED].  Yeah [REDACTED].  Is there anybody in the house with you to help him?
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh my brother comes down.
DOCTOR: Okay.  (Doctor makes a phone call paging another doctor)  Your brother comes by?
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh yeah.  Yeah uh.
DOCTOR: Whoops sorry.
SECOND PERSON H973
[REDACTED] if he does walk around you know he'll stumble, he stumbles.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H973
And you know he'll just.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H973
Catch himself.
PATIENT: I have to use the walker.
DOCTOR: You use a walker, do you have one at home?
PATIENT: Yeah.  When I'm walking and things like that, I had to start using the walker when one end of the house to the other.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I use the walker.
DOCTOR: Can you feel your feet?  Like can you feel me touching you?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And do ever recall besides having that pain, you know you said you get like a sharp kind of stabbing pain sometimes in the back.  You ever fall apart from that?
PATIENT: The pain on the back?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's the bad one.
DOCTOR: Right and does that what makes you stumble?
PATIENT: Yes it is.
DOCTOR: Does anything else make you stumble?
PATIENT: I think that's about the only pain cause it's around my back.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H973
It's the pain that he gets.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  As a matter of fact one time it was so bad that I couldn't even walk.  She had to bring me into the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean, I just took a bone density test.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Just this week.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know what the results were.
DOCTOR: Did you get it here?
PATIENT: I did it, yeah.
DOCTOR: So are you having any back pain now?
PATIENT: Always, always.  It's constant.  If it's severe I can’t stand it, it'll knock you down.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: If I step on it and put weight on it and the pain is there, I'm going to fall and then I grab something.
DOCTOR: So you have osteoporosis.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: And all that means is your bones aren't very dense.  Your bones are normal they're just not very dense.  Um do you take calcium?
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: With vitamin D?
PATIENT: Uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I take it yeah, two times a day, it’s supposed to be three.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I take it two times a day.
DOCTOR: Okay so you know those commercials with Sally Fields?
SECOND PERSON H973
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um usually that's another osteoporosis medicine we put people on sometimes.  Um the reason we worry about osteoporosis is it doesn't in and of itself cause pain.  Most people don't even know they have it but if you do take a spill you're more prone to fractures, that's the problem.  So usually the number one fracture that people with osteoporosis get is they get compression fractures of the back so that may account for the back pain.  I don't know if you have it anywhere else.
SECOND PERSON H973
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah you probably have compression fractures.  I'm not sure um.
SECOND PERSON H973
It just says calcium carbonate, it doesn't say if it has vitamin D or not.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think it's in the fine print.
DOCTOR: You have some scoliosis in there too um.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you were probably born with that.  Let me go talk to DOCTOR, he's my boss.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we'll touch base.  I'll see if she has any suggestions about osteoporosis in terms of either adding.  The calcium carbonate, usually they make calcium and vitamin D together. I’m surprised he’s on just the calcium carbonate.
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I’ve been taking this for years?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Vitamin D pushes the calcium in the bone which is why we have them both together, but I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Get more comfortable.
PATIENT: Okay I'll better sit back and move.
DOCTOR: Just kind of be careful.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'll be back in just a little bit okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  51:40  DOCTOR IN:  61:24)
DOCTOR: Alright, sorry to keep you guys waiting so long.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um so let's do this um your ursodiol that you take for the bladder stones rather um and the test strips and the meter are waiting for you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So stop and pick those up.  We'll do some labs like we talked about.  Um do you have a phone number I can reach you at?
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh yes uh NUMBER.
PATIENT: That's your cell.
SECOND PERSON H973
That's the cell.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll call you when the labs get back so probably, I'll call you by next week.
SECOND PERSON H973
Let me give you my father’s number.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON H973
NUMBER.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'll call you um if there's anything wrong of course I'll call you right away but I'll call you by next week irrespective if it’s right or wrong just to let you know um you know.
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna check a couple things, you know just general like we talked about and just make sure there's nothing else going on.  I don't like to leave things.  We'll start you on the one new medication too, the Sally Field medication the alendronate [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah cause we're at the point where I don't think calcium and vitamin D are enough.  I don't like to put people on medicine unless I think they need it but your osteoporosis is pretty bad.  What we do is they have a score measure you know how dense your bones are and yours are pretty brittle so you got to be careful okay.
PATIENT: So this medication is whatever you were talking about that combines with the calcium?
DOCTOR: No calcium and vitamin D is one thing.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Which you should be on anyway.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um which I'm.
SECOND PERSON H973
Are you going to change this calcium to.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SECOND PERSON H973
Change the calcium.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  He needs [REDACTED] vitamin D.  I don't know why they would put him on just calcium carbonate um.
PATIENT: Is that [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON H973
Uh I think we just had it filled.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well I mean what could you always do is I can give you a vitamin D supplement separate, you can go to Walgreen’s and get a cheap vitamin D supplement that’s fine with me, would you want me to do that and then just use up the calcium?
SECOND PERSON H973
Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll see if we have them here but I think it's important to just put [REDACTED] alendronate which is once a day drug.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay and then we're gonna repeat that test.
SECOND PERSON H973
And the side effects of it is?
DOCTOR: Um in cancer patients they found trouble with um, with the bones of the jaw.  Sometimes people have trouble swallowing um but apart from that it's a very safe drug.  So if you look it up I mean they are bizarre side effects those are the big ones to worry about but more of the side effects like I said were [REDACTED] with the jaw in in cancer patients [REDACTED] move to the bones.  Um very rare but esophageal, you're esophagus next to your mouth, your stomach.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You can have some esophageal narrowing from it so this is a very rare side effect.  Those are the two major ones we watch out for.  If you look it up on Google, you will get nausea and vomiting [REDACTED] shortness of breath [REDACTED] and all these other things.  Sometimes it can cause some stomach upset um so you can let me know if that happens but other than that.
PATIENT: I have my trouble with my stomach.
SECOND PERSON H973
Yeah that's one thing [REDACTED] concerned [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Like the reflux.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's different than what this causes um.  Reflux the best thing is lifestyle and not eating three hours before you go to bed.  Sometimes if people have a lot of trouble they will put their bed up on cinder blocks, not necessary a lot of pillows but put the actual top, you know what I mean, the two posts that are close to the wall.
PATIENT: I might.  They told me that for years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um those are the best things to do for it and if that doesn't work you know there's always medication which I believe.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm taking.
DOCTOR: You're on omeprazole which is the strongest one there is.
PATIENT: I'm taking it in the morning.  Maybe I could take it in the evening.
DOCTOR: Technically it’s a 24 hour drug it shouldn't matter.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But watch the tomato sauce, watch the chocolate.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: All the stuff you like. You just said you like Italian [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I had [REDACTED] all the list of [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: All the [REDACTED] things yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  They told me to put it in my vest.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] than I like.
DOCTOR: Yeah so.
PATIENT: She said moderation, moderation.
DOCTOR: Right yeah.  Long-standing reflux can cause problems but at the point you're at I'm not worry about it; it's more just symptoms you know.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um if you want to hold off on the alendronate, the medication I think that that, you know I can understand at your age if you don’t want to take another drug but I also don't want you falling down and getting a fracture which would be really terrible.
PATIENT: And I'm hoping by the time, that you know this will help with getting out, I have to get rid of it one way or, maybe if I start to exercising.
DOCTOR: Yeah I think that that's important to helping getting out.
SECOND PERSON H973
What did she say about something about the weaknessthat it could be caused from [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Weakness can be caused by anything.
SECOND PERSON H973
I know that he had something with the iron.
DOCTOR: Yeah so you could be iron deficient and us just giving you iron might not be helping much so I'm gonna check the body's iron storage with the blood test.
SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.
DOCTOR: You know um, weakness is such a vague complaint, it's real hard you know so.  For some things we look for um, for some things it's kind of you know it can be caused from anything from just plain old fatigue and like you said hanging on to a cold for a little period but there's nothing in his labs to make me think that there's something real serious going on but we'll repeat some labs today just to make sure the electrolytes aren’t out of whack.
PATIENT: Right now you want me to go to the Lab, so this is for a vitamin deficiency and stuff like that?
DOCTOR: Yes.
SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Any questions for me?  I know we went through a lot and we spent a lot of time.
PATIENT: No, that's what usually happens, thank God, you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It uh, every time I come in I have [REDACTED].  I have no complaint about the VA they treat me like a million bucks and they have, well like I got a stroke, we went to California on vacation one year and I got a stroke while I was there and what hospital do you want to go, oh I said there's only one hospital that I can be with here in California just because it's the VA and they took me there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well they treated me like a million dollars.
DOCTOR: Good, good.  I'm glad to hear it.
PATIENT: And then when I got sick I needed my medications and I happened to be in Texas.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And the nearest hospital was Temple, Texas.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Which was two hours away and I had my cousin drive me over there and the same thing happened, I didn't even have to tell them anything, all they had to do is just put my number in the computer and there it was, everything was on, all the information was there for them.
DOCTOR: That's like invaluable.
SECOND PERSON H973
It really is.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And they gave me all my medications.  [REDACTED] the VA is here for you.
DOCTOR: Alright I've got phone numbers for you, you'll go to the Lab, you'll hear from me, um you know I'll be here for a few hours so if I find anything serious I'll call you right away either today or tomorrow.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I'll check in the morning [REDACTED].
PATIENT: If I'm not at home, I'm not, I can't get to, just leave a message to call you.
DOCTOR: Yeah, okay.  Good, alright.  I'll make sure that you have enough refills to call everything in.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And it's going to be waiting for you at the window, you'll get your strips, your meter, your ursodiol and now the once a day pills.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you have any questions about these I'll give you my card so we use it quite a bit you know um anything else?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: I think we pretty much covered it huh?
PATIENT: Yeah you did a very good job today.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Here's my card um.  It was a pleasure to meet you.  Do you know where the Lab is?
PATIENT: Yes I do.  Okay doctor, thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay be careful walking okay.
SECOND PERSON H973

PATIENT: Alright.
