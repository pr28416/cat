DOCTOR: Okay, well I understand that you are a patient of DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Is that's true?
PATIENT: That's true yes.
DOCTOR: Okay so what brings you to the clinic today?
PATIENT: Well blood pressure basically, chest pains.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay so tell me when does it start, what's happening?
SECOND PERSON Z459
Did read any of the prior notes?
DOCTOR: So let's see.
SECOND PERSON Z459
We faxed some tests results.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Been talking back and forth with DOCTOR um, he's had some elevated blood pressure readings.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Uh chest pain.  Uh he had an epidural on Friday and because we were here they told us to come in after he was done.
PATIENT: Done here.
SECONDD PERSON Z459
And of course because he had twighlight um his blood pressure was fine when he was here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Over this weekend uh, quite frankly, he had a horrible weekend, especially Friday night.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Tachycardia of 122, uh blood pressure was quite elevated, uh 180/112 um.  He didn't have increased respirations.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECONDD PERSON Z459.
He didn't have increased respirations but um I had him taking nitro.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Which he's not prone to do because it gives him such a headache.  Um but uh this is something that's been going on for a while.
DOCTOR: So all of a sudden your blood pressure goes up and then you have chest pain?
SECOND PERSON Z459
No it's been going up uh on a regular basis.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Um.  Spoke to her.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Um couple of times, uh she said well we'll do a follow-up appointment, that's not until March 16th.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Things got worse, I gave her a call um, faxed her the test results and she said um she could talk to the attending and get back to me and I never heard anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
So then I spoke to NAME several times trying to get down to the bottom of it because um quite frankly, well Friday night on a scale of 1-10, uh he probably was at a 20.
DOCTOR: In pain?
SECOND PERSON Z459
In pain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Uh, continuing over the weekend, his blood pressure was elevated.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Pulse anywhere from 90 to 102.
DOCTOR: And the whole time you're having chest pains?
PATIENT: Yeah I have, actually dear I'm having chest pains right now.
DOCTOR: Right now you're having chest pain?
PATIENT: Yeah.  They don't, they elevated.  They come but they don't ever completely go away.  They've been that way for a while now.
DOCTOR: And on a scale of 1-10 how bad is the chest pain?
PATIENT: Right now, probably a 5.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
And that's about the lowest that they go.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay and how long has, you said this is gradually getting worse.  How long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Probably the better part of a good month, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I see DOCTOR in the fall.
DOCTOR: Yeah and he gave.
PATIENT: And my blood pressure was starting to give me problems then.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And she decided to add another blood pressure pill to the regimen I was already on.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I take like 20 mg at night when I go to bed.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But regardless taking it in the morning or taking it at night together, uh it's like all weekend long my blood pressure was systolic wise it was in the 150s, low 160s.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so since then it's just been going up?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So what are you on, let's see you're on diltiazem, why are you on diltiazem?  Is that just for blood pressure?
PATIENT: No my heart.
DOCTOR: But why?
PATIENT: I have a bad valve.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
And he has coronary artery spasms.
DOCTOR: So how did they diagnosis the coronary artery spasm?
SECOND PERSON Z459
Angio.
DOCTOR: Okay and they saw that.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Right at the time it was happening.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Cause he's had heart attacks in the past but they could never find anything.
PATIENT: Because they never could catch it when it was going on at the exact time.
DOCTOR: Okay and then they did a cath and it was negative and that was in 2009.
PATIENT: No in 2009 they did a cath.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: And it was.
DOCTOR: They saw spasms.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z459
They finally saw it.  He had had prior heart attacks.
DOCTOR: Oh.
SECOND PERSON Z459
But nobody ever saw anything.
DOCTOR: Oh and finally.
PATIENT: Yeah DOCTOR found it, that was down at Holy Cross Hospital.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: At Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Yeah when NAME took my blood pressure, we got here, what was it again NAME?
DOCTOR: Yeah it was 148/102.
PATIENT: And she took it just before we left the house to come here and it was 161/102.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well yeah, you're not, it's not really been under control hmm.  Okay, well a couple of things.  When was the last time you had an EKG and a lot of other things for you?  And if you're having active chest pain.
PATIENT: I mean when I had the epidural on Friday.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They hooked, because of my heart the way it is, they didn't want to take any precautions so they made me have the epidural in the OR.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Basically he's had no testing.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
She did say to me when was his last stress test?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z459
I said it was probably at least 2 1/2 years ago.
PATIENT: It would have been in November of 09.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Yeah.
DOCTOR: So then okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
And again she was going to talk to the attending and get back to me and I have never heard.
PATIENT: But we never heard from her.
DOCTOR: Yeah what testing have you gotten so far?  You said that you had.
PATIENT:
DOCTOR: I first started coming into the VA.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now you said that you faxed something to us, what did you fax to us?
SECOND PERSON Z459
I faxed um.
PATIENT: I bet it's not in the computer.
DOCTOR: No, it wouldn’t be.
SECOND PERSON Z459
An EKG, an echocardiogram report um.
PATIENT: You brought it with you didn't you?
SECOND PERSON Z459
Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what I thought.
DOCTOR: May I take a look at those?
PATIENT: Those were just done in January.
DOCTOR: Now this chest pain is it worse when you're walking around or do you just notice it worse when your blood pressure is higher.  Is it chest pain and where is it?  Is it on the left side; is it on the right side?
PATIENT: It moves.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So like right now it's bothering me like right in here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Sometimes it's in here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Sometimes it's in here and goes down my arm.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  And is it worse with the blood pressure, you notice if the blood pressure is high that's when your chest pain is worse?
PATIENT: If I'm just sitting down totally relaxed, we'll say watching television or reading a book.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I could still be sitting here having chest pain.  I get up and move around, especially here of late maybe the last week, 10 days, all of a sudden I'll find myself getting short of breath.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then the pain elevates so I'm sure if I go back and take my blood pressure or have NAME take it.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it would be high.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: So you think it's associated with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh I don't think there's any way around it.  I, but like I was saying when I had the epidural on Friday morning.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they had me all hooked up, I don't know if that's actually the case, but they were watching my heart.
DOCTOR: Well yeah but that's not an EKG.
PATIENT: So what they didn't see anything per se or they wouldn't of did the epidural.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: And that was your blood pressure right, they just saw you in the clinic.
PATIENT: Right.  Now I see DOCTOR this week as a matter of fact.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Thursday.
DOCTOR: So one of the things is your chronic low back pain is why they did the epidural.
PATIENT: Correct.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Lower back pain.  He has a right rotator cuff.
DOCTOR: Oh.  So what's wrong with your mitral valve?  Do you know?
PATIENT: I got everything that DOCTOR ever did on my heart but I didn't bring all that in here.  It should be in the computer from DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She had all my records at one time.
DOCTOR: Yeah and none of this, any of this, there's no echo or anything here.  This is all from different things.
SECOND PERSON Z459
There's an echo there.  It might be on the other side.
DOCTOR: Oh I see.  They're all double-sided.
PATIENT: Yeah see this number right here concerned me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: Okay here's your echo.  So where did you get all this stuff done?
SECOND PERSON Z459
Loyola.
DOCTOR: Do you see a doctor at Loyola?
SECOND PERSON Z459
No it was uh basically to get a baseline for ourselves.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Cause he has a triple A.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
And because he has such severe back pain I kind of wanted some, I'm an RN.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z459
I kind of wanted to know when it was back pain and when we had to worry about triple A.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
So, DOCTOR you now.
PATIENT: So basically what we did was.
SECOND PERSON Z459
To know the size of the aneurysm now.
DOCTOR: So, okay, why did you have all this wasn’t done here at the VA?
SECOND PERSON Z459
Good question.
PATIENT: I tried to get DOCTOR to send me to a cardiologist last fall and she came back in and said they didn't.
SECOND PERSON Z459
She could take care of it herself.
PATIENT: Yeah and they never sent me to him.
DOCTOR: Okay so how did you get this?  Who did you see at Loyola?
SECOND PERSON Z459
This was just like a clinic where you pay for it.
DOCTOR: Oh you can get all these like.
SECOND PERSON Z459
All these summations done, some yeah.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z459
We didn't get with DOCTOR you just have to pay for it.
DOCTOR: I see.  Um so how long ago was all this?  Oh January 11th.
PATIENT: Yeah, what a month ago.  A month and what two days.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z459
It would have been wonderful that they did something here but it's not from the lack of us asking for it.
DOCTOR: The way they are reporting these things are kind of strange.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Yeah.
PATIENT: Basically though that's more like a baseline to like bring to you or to a cardiologist.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So that they have an idea because there's stuff in there that should have been followed up on so.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you have some diastolic dysfunction but that's kind of expected when you've had a history of heart disease and that kind of thing.
SECOND PERSON Z459
She made a comment about um, uh because of his triglyceride level.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z459
That she should change him off the simvastatin and put him on something else but she said again I needed to talk to the attending and then I never heard nothing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I'm actually looking at your most recent lipids and you look okay.  They actually look more than fine.
PATIENT: Those were a year ago.
DOCTOR: February yeah.
PATIENT: So it was a year ago, DOCTOR ordered all that blood work.  That was a year ago.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z459
There's a lipid panel in those papers.
PATIENT: Yeah see I wouldn't, she was, what NAME told us on Friday when we came in.
DOCTOR: Now this just says that, it doesn't give me the numbers it just said that your numbers were normal.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah I mean she said she was going to talk to DOCTOR Friday afternoon cause she wasn't here when we were here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And have her call us and.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Never called.
PATIENT: Then again we never heard from her.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I.  NAME did get this appointment scheduled today.  Obviously we're in here seeing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: To see you because it was the only thing she could find available.
DOCTOR: It was the only thing open.
PATIENT: Right.
SECOND PERSON Z459
And the EKG here says see doc soon for symptoms.
DOCTOR: And the EKG.
SECOND PERSON Z459
They didn't really give us; they didn't really give us a report on the EKG itself.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you're triglycerides are a little high but actually we don't really treat triglycerides other than.
SECOND PERSON Z459
That’s what she said yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So they're not really, we wouldn't do anything about that.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Well she made [REDACTED] about the simvastatin so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um let's see.  And then there’s this early [REDACTED] change.
SECOND PERSON Z459
I mean that obviously we need to get the blood pressure more under control and we got that.
DOCTOR: Right.  Well okay and right now you're saying you're having a 5 out of 10 chest pain?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  If I get up and start moving around very much it'll get worse.
DOCTOR: It does.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.  I guarantee you it will.
DOCTOR: Is it similar to the coronary stabbing pain you had before?
PATIENT: Um you mean as far as me actually having, like call 911 and have the ambulance come and get me?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Normally if it goes all the way out, I mean it looks, it feels, it's the worst pain you could ever imagine in your life.  It's like an elephant sat down on my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But normally it'll make me sick and then it's like I'll break out into, what, a hard sweat within seconds, maybe a minute, you'd think somebody poured a bucket of water on me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: If I'm laying in bed the whole bed will be soaked.  If I'm sitting on the chair like this, there'll be a puddle underneath me.
DOCTOR: Well what I would do is get a troponin and EKG.  If you're having active chest pain we have to look at that.  Um and then I would order a stress test and if you're really having chest pain with angina and you know sometimes we would consider sending people with these symptoms to Cardiology to get a cath.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so let me talk with my attending.
PATIENT: Yeah because see I don't know if DOCTOR showed him any of this stuff.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or her or what [REDACTED].  I haven't because she never responded back to us again.
DOCTOR: And maybe because, you know the residents aren't always here so I'm not sure what rotation she's on, you know a lot of these things um.
PATIENT: I don't know what she said.
SECOND PERSON Z459
No I know she was there that afternoon, Friday afternoon and we left at 12:30 and she was just coming in so I know that she had that afternoon she could have called me and I had talked to her on Wednesday.  Thursday she was there.
DOCTOR: Sure.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Um so I mean, I don't want to completely uh says she you know.
PATIENT: It's more; again she didn't return any calls.
SECOND PERSON Z459
And DOCTOR had NAME call me and tell me we're not sure what to do yet.
DOCTOR: Right.  Well have a seat here, let me just examine you.  I'm going to send to get another EKG for our records and I'm going to talk to my boss.
PATIENT: You need me to take my shirt off here?
DOCTOR: Yeah that would be helpful.  Either way when they do the EKG they'll probably need that.
PATIENT: Oh they'll have me take it off, yeah sure.
DOCTOR: But I don't know they may not do it in here though so, actually just keep it on, I'll lift it to examine and then they'll have you take it all the way off cause you may have to move to a different room so.  Deep breath.  You said about a month you've been noticing this right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Sometime about a month, around there yeah.
DOCTOR: Can I get you to lay back down here?  So it's worse with exertion and when your blood pressure is up?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: And right now how's your back pain?
PATIENT: Um I'm a little sore but I mean that's still from the epidural.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So no.
PATIENT: I'm not in as much pain in my lower back.
DOCTOR: No belly pain?  And point to your chest pain again?
PATIENT: Right now?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It's right in here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's right here.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Does it hurt when I push down at all?  Any change to that pain?
PATIENT: I can feel that, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Did it feel like the pain that you're having?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It does?
PATIENT: Yeah.  See like you hit right here I feel that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: When you get down in here I feel that.
DOCTOR: So that's the pain that you're feeling?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay so that actually makes me a lot less concerned.  When you have something, so what this is called is reproducible chest pain and when you have something reproducible chest pain it's a lot less concerning.  It makes me think it's more of a muscle spasm versus your heart.
PATIENT: Ah, I disagree.
DOCTOR: Well when I push down it hurts right?
PATIENT: No not necessarily.  I feel it.
DOCTOR: You feel it but it's not the same pain that you're feeling?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Cause you feel it here too right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay but it's not the same pain that you'll have in your chest.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON Z459
He usually has it like right here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON Z459
And then right upper gastric.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Oh left I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Left chest okay and its worse when you're running around, going upstairs and its worse with high blood pressure.  What about eating or laying down, does that change anything?
PATIENT: Yeah, I mean.  I'm smart enough to know because I take something for stomach anyway.
DOCTOR: Yeah for GERD or something like that.  This is definitely not that.
PATIENT: No, no.  Um it's not gastric.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If that's what you're asking me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So that's what, in the beginning that's what I thought.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That it was gastric pain because I was getting so much of it in here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But no and it's different.  I know I've had going back and forth in my stomach for years.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well let me, um come with me cause I want you to get an EKG and I'll talk to my boss.  DOCTOR will see you and he'll bring you back to my room when he's finished.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay thank you very much.
(DOCTOR OUT:  91:00 DOCTOR IN:  95:54)
DOCTOR: After you get the EKG um, is she [REDACTED] the machine right now? okay. So I talked with my attending and we think its best that you actually go to the Emergency Department right away.  There's a couple of lab tests that I wanted to order and it just happens a lot quicker if you just go there.  So after you get, you are going to get the EKG right now and then just go.
PATIENT: Do you agree with it?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we just want to make sure that there aren’t any [REDACTED] changes, not anything alarming,  it's just easier like if you're there to just hook him up to get another EKG there.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay.
DOCTOR: And then after that go to the Emergency Department.  [REDACTED] send him down.
SECOND PERSON Z459
So what blood tests?
DOCTOR: So it's like a Troponin, that kind of thing.  They'll evaluate him down there, they'll get a chest x-ray right away, and they’ll do it right away so the doctors can look at it right away um you know and they'll see the EKG that we did.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Will they contact you?
DOCTOR: Yeah, um they'll contact DOCTOR since she's your doctor but they'll take care of you down there, anything they can do to [REDACTED] like that stress test I'm just going to go ahead and order it now.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: Um and they'll schedule that for you.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay but after NAME does this we'll send you down there.  I just want to make sure there's nothing very obvious on here okay.
SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay, alright.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll be right in here.
(Patient is getting an EKG in the room)
PATIENT: taken to the Emergency Department.
Time is 12:25.
