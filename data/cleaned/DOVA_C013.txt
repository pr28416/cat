DOCTOR: Helps you deal with the Parkinson.

DOCTOR: Miralax.  That will be good for you, the sucralfate will be good for you.

DOCTOR: Oh sometimes uh, sometimes people with Parkinson.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: At this point can [REDACTED] sometimes it's hard for them to turn.  It's called, we call it postural instability which means they can do fine but when you turn you have a hard time turning.
PATIENT: Well I said that before, my body turns but my legs don't.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: I found that to be many times.

DOCTOR: You can see me as often as you like.  I was thinking we can go every six months but if you wanted to see me sooner we can do that too.  Do you want to be seen sooner?
PATIENT: Well maybe.
DOCTOR: No.  Are you having any, are you having any thyroid symptoms?  Cause sometimes constipation could be from thyroid.
PATIENT: Really?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But how would I know that I have a thyroid problem?
DOCTOR: Are you um, you're not gaining weight.  Do you feel like your reaction is slower?  Do you feel fatigued, do you feel like you're skin is dry?  Do you feel like your hair is getting coarse or anything?
PATIENT: No I can't think, if I had I didn’t recognize it.
