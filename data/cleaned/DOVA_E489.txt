SECOND PERSON E489
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don't know when it was.  But I did have [REDACTED] cramps in my ankles and stuff and I would put the brake on.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My foot slipped off and I should have put some new springs on but I didn't.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But anyway I got my foot in between the gas pedal and the brakes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Alright, so no weakness.  Are you usually in a wheelchair?  How much do you walk?

SECOND PERSON E489
15 years ago.
PATIENT: Okay.
SECOND PERSON E489
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh I got you.  Squeeze my fingers.
PATIENT: Which ones?
DOCTOR: Okay, put your hands out this way.  Don't let me push. Okay and this way.  Ah you're strong and smile for me.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And close your eyes really tight and I'm going to take your glasses off and then what you looking, very good.  Okay can you frown? Okay.  And puff out your cheeks, very good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Push on my hand this way, take my way [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] right.
DOCTOR: Very good, very good.  The other way, very good.  Just checking your strength here, okay.  Alright now let me just take a look in your eyes.
SECOND PERSON E489
Did you have a headache yesterday?
PATIENT: Yeah I had [REDACTED] in the left eye like it was fogged over.
DOCTOR: Was it blurry?
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON E489
He's doctoring that for a year now.  It had infection in the pupil.
DOCTOR: Okay alright.  Um close your eyes and let me know if you feel me touching you okay.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright good.  Well um the concern is always you know um whether or not you had a stroke. You know with symptoms like this.  [REDACTED] you had some memory problems before.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But this seems like a chunk of it is missing.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um and you have a fib, right irregular heart rhythm?
SECOND PERSON E489
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you're not on Coumadin.
SECOND PERSON E489
No.
DOCTOR: And that increases the you know if you could have like a clot, a little clot forming in your heart, that's not, you know because your heart is not pumping regular.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So that could have, you know went up to your brain and caused some you know memory problems.  So you know I think we should get a CAT scan, you know just to have to make sure there is nothing acute there.  Are you on daily aspirin though?
SECOND PERSON E489
Yes.
DOCTOR: E489
And you’re [REDACTED] okay.  And uh okay.  So what I would do is continue taking this aspirin and uh we'll scan the head and see if there is anything new there that um.
PATIENT: I'll be lucky if there was.
DOCTOR: Uh the treatment is all the same, you know taking aspirin and we’ll look at the dose on the different medications but the um, the thing is...  Was it you that didn't want to do the Coumadin, no?
PATIENT: I don't even know what it is.  I've heard of it.
DOCTOR: Well it's a blood thinner.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know to make sure that your blood is thin enough so you don't forming the clots.
SECOND PERSON E489
See he had a buddy who was diabetic and he was on Coumadin and he died in a pool of blood. Five years ago. I think that’s . . .
PATIENT: It can’t be that long ago.
DOCTOR: Well I’ll let DOCTOR talk to you about this issue to see if you want to be on Coumadin, don't want to be on Coumadin.  I mean um.
SECOND PERSON E489
I wonder if I should test for Alzheimer?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh this was kind of like one acute episode it would be like a transient ischemic attack, that's what it sounds like um and uh let's just first make sure that there is nothing acute like stroke going on now and then from, after that we would get a neuropsychiatry evaluation that could be done for that.
PATIENT: Cause he usually knows all the questions.  I mean he's strong in [REDACTED], just not on his like if the doctor asks him his date of birth and who's president and what day of the week you know.
PATIENT: But actually I couldn't think. Now I tell you I couldn't, no.
SECOND PERSON E489
You couldn't think yesterday.  I was surprised that I got the phone call last night that you even knew the phone number.
PATIENT: Well I had this paper that had it.
SECOND PERSON E489
That's what I wanted to, where can you get a bracelet or dog tags or for his ankle or his wrist.
DOCTOR: Oh, good question.  Um.
SECOND PERSON E489
You’d think the hospital might know.
DOCTOR: Let me check.
SECOND PERSON E489
I haven't asked the right person yet.
DOCTOR: I'll check on that okay.  Okay, I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Don’t forget us.
SECOND PERSON E489
[REDACTED]
(DOCTOR OUT:  84:33  DOCTOR IN:  97:29)
DOCTOR: PATIENT.
PATIENT: Hello.
DOCTOR: Hey there, I'm DOCTOR.  I work with DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Hi there, you must be Mrs. PATIENT.
SECOND PERSON E489
Hello.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON E489
Me.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh I don't know about that.  Get in the habit.
DOCTOR: First what do you remember?  What do you last remember?
PATIENT: Oh I don't know, I was driving and I didn't know where I was going and I just kept driving.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  How did you know something was wrong?
PATIENT: Well I talked to him a little bit ago.  [REDACTED] when we were first here so.  I don't know. I just kept going.  Where I was going I don't know that yet.
DOCTOR: But how did you know that something was wrong?
SECOND PERSON E489
But then you decided you needed to walk your legs or was it when you decided you needed gasoline or was it because of your hunger?
PATIENT: Probably both uh but my legs, both of them was real numb.  I had a lot of cramps in them.
DOCTOR: Which side of your legs went numb?
PATIENT: I don't know which side really they just went numb and I went to hit the brake and it slipped off and got between the brake and the foot pedal and I had a heck of a time getting my leg out of there.
DOCTOR: Were you driving along without knowing it or did you stop and then.
PATIENT: No I kept driving but I stopped two or three times when my legs was numb and I walked.
SECOND PERSON E489
How did the young man find you that called me?
PATIENT: I found him and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Who called up you?
SECOND PERSON E489
A gentleman by the name of NAME and he was going to call me back but in the meantime instead of him calling me back then the local police.
DOCTOR: What did they say?
SECOND PERSON E489
[REDACTED] way down south by Joliet.
DOCTOR: How many miles is that from here?
SECOND PERSON E489
So they told him 75.
DOCTOR: And what did they say was wrong?  What did they notice?
SECOND PERSON E489
Uh I got no.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON E489
[REDACTED].  Then [REDACTED] called and DOCTOR called me and said I have your husband and he's alright but uh there's something wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON E489
And uh they [REDACTED] that he hadn't had his medications yesterday morning and he was due for medications in the evening at 7:30 last night and he was due for his medications in the evening and then [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON E489
And uh but we didn't know if he'd had anything to eat all day or not so he says I'm going to talk to him a bit and oh he said he was going to put him on I55 to head him back home.
DOCTOR: Well what did they say was wrong though, I'm still not sure I understand?  Why, he just said there was someone here who's not sure why he's here or not sure how he got here or [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON E489
I know, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] where I'd been.
DOCTOR: But you don't remember.
SECOND PERSON E489
They didn't know.
DOCTOR: Do you remember talking to someone at all?
SECOND PERSON E489
He didn't have anybody to talk to other than.
DOCTOR: Okay, were you confused how you got there?
PATIENT: I didn't question it I just didn't know how I got there.
DOCTOR: Has it ever happened to you before?
SECOND PERSON E489
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Not like that.
SECOND PERSON E489
Nothing like that, not that far away.  But it’s happened [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Tell me about what else has happened.
SECOND PERSON E489
Well we live about 5-8 blocks from a restaurant and he likes to go there and listen to the conversations with the guys you know and have a cup of coffee.  Some guys will have breakfast there.  So if he gets up early I know where he's going to but yesterday I didn't.  And I never did find out but then when I didn't call there to see if he had been there yesterday morning.  So he might have got up and got going to where he was going before I ever knew anything and normally if he leaves at 8, he'll come in about 10:30 and he didn't come in, I figured he'll be here for noon meal and it was our anniversary so I had planned to go out to eat.
DOCTOR: How long ago was all of this?
PATIENT: Yesterday.
DOCTOR: Oh this was all yesterday.
SECOND PERSON E489
This was all yesterday.
DOCTOR: But what happened, but I thought this happened once before?
SECOND PERSON E489
Okay I'm the one that’s confused.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON E489
I was telling about the restaurant not being very far away so then he left the restaurant one day and he ended up some place east of Schaumburg and got home.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON E489
And got back home and um then the other time we were, I don't know what he was doing but he ended up down 59 going south and you ended up in Streamwood, but I had never been to that part of the city Streamwood.
DOCTOR: Have you had problems with memory? Have you noticed any?
SECOND PERSON E489
Uh.
PATIENT: Well my memory used to be wonderful.  I mean I could [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON E489
He remembers more back when than he does now and yesterday.
DOCTOR: Have you had any problems with dementia?  Has anyone ever said you have dementia?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON E489
I don't know the difference between it and Alzheimer.
DOCTOR: Well has anyone said that you have Alzheimer before?
PATIENT: The doctor didn’t give [REDACTED] I don't know.
DOCTOR: Have you felt your heart pounding at all?
PATIENT: Yeah I have a few times [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: When was the last time you felt your heart pounding?
PATIENT: Oh I don’t know, not very often.
DOCTOR: Not very often.
SECOND PERSON E489
He always talks about getting a cramp.
PATIENT: I get a lot of cramps.
DOCTOR: What about that numb feeling in your legs?
PATIENT: I don't know it just goes numb.
DOCTOR: How often does that happen?
PATIENT: Oh [REDACTED] around my feet and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Do your arms ever go numb or just your legs?  Do your arms feel like they ever go numb or just your legs?
PATIENT: Well my arms will but I don't know about my hands or anything.
DOCTOR: You tell me about the numbness in his legs.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]
SECOND PERSON E489
[REDACTED] numbness [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah it's hard to know exactly what has happened if it was.  It sounds like you've been having some background memory problems and um.
PATIENT: Now I, my memory has just gone to heck.  I mean I can start from here to there and I lost it you know.
SECOND PERSON E489
It's been 22 years since he's traveled anywhere out of the country and he's been talking like it was yesterday or last week.
DOCTOR: How long did the whole episode last?
SECOND PERSON E489
All day yesterday so.
DOCTOR: You didn't know that until you got the phone call from the police that he was 70 miles south?
SECOND PERSON E489
Right.
DOCTOR: Has his blood sugar ever run low?
PATIENT: It runs low.
SECOND PERSON E489
Once in a while.  When it runs low that's when he'll stick his finger but otherwise.
DOCTOR: By chance did you check it yesterday when you found him?
SECOND PERSON E489
No.
DOCTOR: Okay can you take your glasses off for a second?
SECOND PERSON E489
No because he was so hungry when he came in and he wanted to eat right away.
DOCTOR: Open your eyes real big.  What happened to that left eye?
PATIENT: I had the wrong doctor work on them.
DOCTOR: Has that pupil always been like that?
SECOND PERSON E489
Not quite as bad.
PATIENT: No the [REDACTED] came off and it pulled apart and when they put it back in about two pieces.
SECOND PERSON E489
He lost the vitreous fluid and now.
DOCTOR: Can you see out of that eye?
PATIENT: A little bit yes.
SECOND PERSON E489
He [REDACTED] I don't know how much he can see but for the last year now they've been doctoring him for inflammation [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Open your mouth please.  Say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Smile. Relax.  Does your face look a little different to you?
PATIENT: Oh I don't feel like it.
SECOND PERSON E489
I don't think he looks, I'd really have to say the whole [REDACTED] of the face.
DOCTOR: Does this side look a little droopy to you?
PATIENT: The left eye does.
DOCTOR: Is that new? That droop.
SECOND PERSON E489
It’s Just a little fatter.
DOCTOR: Okay [REDACTED] against my hand. Can you turn this way.  Are you able to walk at all?
PATIENT: Oh yes.
DOCTOR: Let's have you walk a little bit.
PATIENT: I've been a little more tippy lately in getting my balance, I know that.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Do you always walk with a cane?
PATIENT: Yes now.
SECOND PERSON E489
Oh he can forget that cane and we can look for it.
DOCTOR: Let's have you take a couple steps for me.
SECOND PERSON E489
For a half an hour before we can find it.
DOCTOR: Have you lost any control of your bowel or your bladder?
PATIENT: Oh yes off and on yes.
DOCTOR: Is that a new problem?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON E489
Uh uh.
SECOND PERSON E489
No it's not new.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Just relax.
PATIENT: You better get a bigger hammer than that now.
SECOND PERSON E489
There's no kneecap there.
DOCTOR: What happened there?
SECOND PERSON E489
Oh the VA took it off and forgot to put it back in, 60 years ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  I want you to squeeze my fingers.  Now push this way, look the other way, now back.  I don't think he's as strong as there.  [REDACTED].  Oh we'll give DOCTOR a call, your doctor.  It's hard to know cause you don't really know what happened and that makes us a little concerned and as you know you have risk factors to have a stroke and/or what we call a warning sign for a stroke like a TIA and it could not be, this all could just be memory problems or something more longstanding but with the numbness in your leg and not knowing what's going on, I would agree with DOCTOR to get a scan of his head, a CAT scan and it would probably make more sense to send you to the Emergency Room um where they can get the scan of the head and ask Neurology to see you okay, to make sure that nothing else needs to be done.  There are a couple of things that we'd be worried about.  Um so I think that's what I recommend doing now.  I know depending on how busy they are that could be, if you've gone there before its several hours in the ER you know but it's the safest for you.
SECOND PERSON E489
That's why he started [REDACTED] today.  We had been to Podiatry this morning and talking with a girl there and she said you're going to see a doctor before you leave, try to get in the clinic and if you can't you go to the Emergency and I'm going to follow up you've got to do something today.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON E489
So we brought him in.
DOCTOR: Yeah there's a reason why, I mean but the, ER, the nice thing is we can get all this expedited which we can't do here.  So what do you think about that?
SECOND PERSON E489
Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We have to give the docs a call to let them know he’s coming and what you now we should do.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And uh, I just think it's going to be the safest thing for you okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
SECOND PERSON E489
You're just wanting to help so I agree, because.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Alright we'll get them going on it.
SECOND PERSON E489
[REDACTED] the limo got him in at 1 o'clock last night and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright.
SECOND PERSON E489
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It makes the most sense for you okay so.
PATIENT: Okay. What are we doing?
SECOND PERSON E489
We'll go on to Emergency.
DOCTOR: Down to Emergency Room.
PATIENT: Now?
SECOND PERSON E489
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  I'll give them a call to give the doctors a head’s up, but um, but uh they'll be able to do a CAT scan much faster than – we order it here and then come back again, and uh then Neurology folks can see you there.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And do a neurological examination and such, okay.
SECOND PERSON E489
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: I hope.
DOCTOR: And they can do the EKG.
PATIENT: Oh while you doing that, I really needed to say [REDACTED].  What [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: This one?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] that's nothing.
PATIENT: Oh well then you can have it.
SECOND PERSON E489
He says that he wanted to, they never [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah it's benign.
SECOND PERSON E489
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Alright.  I'm going to give the doctors a call that you’re on your way there, alright.
SECOND PERSON E489
Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I told the nurse, I had a hang nail on that big toe.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They could take it out; the dumb thing seems to hurt.  I had some antibiotic salve I put on it.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it seemed like that [REDACTED] thing now [REDACTED] I don't know.
DOCTOR: Well tell them in the Emergency Room as well.  They can give you some pain medication.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
SECOND PERSON E489
They can probably put the salve on now.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON E489
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: 113:0
Time is 4:50.
