DOCTOR: PATIENT?  How you doing today?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Oh man its freezing.
PATIENT: It could be worse.
DOCTOR: How much worse can it get?
PATIENT: That's true.
DOCTOR: No [REDACTED].  So how have things been going with you sir?
PATIENT: Okay.  You know I got a question for you. Before I forget.
DOCTOR: You got a question [REDACTED] what?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The doctor before you, when I first started taking some of these pills, after a while your system, blood is, whatever he said you don't need to take this lipisil so I wasn't taking it.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Yeah I wasn't taking it and all of sudden through the mail I got like two bottles, that's what I get guess I'm supposed to take it.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Then one of the gals called about the blood test, I told her about that and said you gotta be wrong, I said no, so I said so I started taking it again and I said the docs told me, I said what do I do with the pills that I got?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Just put them on the side.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let's see when you were last in.  You were on lisinopril; it was on your medication list way back in October of 09.
PATIENT: Yeah it was way back.
DOCTOR: You should be taking it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Will you do me a favor?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I called in for what I need refills on and I didn't ask about the lisinopril.
DOCTOR: The lisinopril?
PATIENT: Yeah could you put.
DOCTOR: I renewed all of your medications as of yesterday.
PATIENT: Oh good.
DOCTOR: Yeah so you should be getting them all in the mail and uh how have things been going for you?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: You look thinner.  Do you think you're losing water weight or what?
PATIENT: Oh that and I work out.
DOCTOR: You started working out?
PATIENT: Yeah.  The only thing I got now, I got a damn head cold.  I got like an on/off sore throat.  My ears blocked up and maybe if they open up, you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  How long has that been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh about almost two weeks.  I'll pop a Hall's and it soothes the throat.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any fevers or anything like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know when you’re real smart, and you're too lazy to go to the bedroom to the coat to get [REDACTED] sticking out of the mail slot, and you open the door with a skinny shirt on [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh I hate to be an idiot.
DOCTOR: So let's go over all your problems step by step here.  The health issues anyway.  For your diabetes, um did you get labs done when you came in today, labs today or?
PATIENT: Yes.  Just had it.
DOCTOR: That was just your INR though, your Coumadin level right?
PATIENT: I guess yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um, back in November of last year, your diabetes was under pretty good control.
PATIENT: Well I monitor myself you know three times a week uh.
DOCTOR: How have your numbers been?
PATIENT: Like uh 100-120.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When do you take your meaurement then?
PATIENT: Well it's supposed to be on a Monday before breakfast, I take it like 7 o'clock.
DOCTOR: And that's running like 100-120?
PATIENT: Yeah around there, about 120 and then on the Wednesday before lunch so that's usually like around 1 o'clock and that's low.  Sometimes it's even 105.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then on a Friday before supper, I've had it where it was down to 90.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you ever had any episodes of really low blood sugars, where you're kind of feeling shaky or lightheaded?
PATIENT: One time.
DOCTOR: Just one time, when was that?
PATIENT: Oh gosh that was during the summer.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It was one of those days when it was hot and I was doing something, oh I was playing with the dogs in the backyard and got all sweated up and then came in the house, that's when I started feeling that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  When did you last see an eye doctor?
PATIENT: Uh last year.
DOCTOR: That was here?
PATIENT: No, my other glasses got broke and I had to go to my neighborhood, [REDACTED] Pearle Vision.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I went over there and I got a pair of glasses.
DOCTOR: Well we're going to have you see the eye doctors here.
PATIENT: Hey uh that's right I did the.
DOCTOR: The diabetes scan?
PATIENT: Yeah that was three years?
DOCTOR: Wow, we need to get you in there.
PATIENT: About three years ago.
DOCTOR: Yeah, lets get you in there.  Um do take an aspirin?
PATIENT: Yeah in the evenings, a kiddie aspirin.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Children's aspirin, I call them kiddie.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So we need to have you see and this is just a test for diabetes of the eyes, not for glasses.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Or anything like that.  Alright so diabetes looks like pretty good. Um you’re doing a good job measuring blood sugars, you're just taking the one medication for that, the metformin.
PATIENT: Yeah half of it.
DOCTOR: Yeah half a tab so that looks pretty good.  Your cholesterol was pretty close to where we want it back in November.  Your bad cholesterol is 74; we want that around 70, certainly less than 100.  Um in regards to your a fib or [REDACTED], you're on the Coumadin for that.  You're following with the Coumadin Clinic right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you're also on two medications, metoprolol.  What is the dose of your metoprolol?  Do you know?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Cause there was different, when I was reviewing your meds yesterday, it was different, this one says 100 mg but that's just over, I renewed it for, so you're going to be taking 75 mg.  How many pills are you taking of the metoprolol?  Do you know?  Are you taking one or one and a half?
PATIENT: Uh, the metoprolol, is it a little, is that the diabetic one?
DOCTOR: No that's for your blood pressure and heart.
PATIENT: Uh one.
DOCTOR: One twice a day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I see here there are two orders in the system.  One was for 75 mg twice a day and one was for 100 mg twice a day and there's no.
PATIENT: Well one I take twice a day and the other one is once a day.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Let's do the 100 mg, I think you've been taking the 100 mg that you've been taking.
PATIENT: That one I take once a day in the morning.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I got that metoprolol tartrate.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.
PATIENT: And other metoprolol, that's like a green color, blue, that's the one I take twice a day.
DOCTOR: Sure.  Um, are you on any water pills?
PATIENT: Yeah the furosemide.
DOCTOR: Twice a day right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And how's, have you been watching your weight?  Like uh daily or no?
PATIENT: You can't have everything.
DOCTOR: Have you been watching your salt intake?
PATIENT: I don't use any.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What about like eating salty foods, fried foods?
PATIENT: No I don't.  I've never, even when I was a kid.  My family are Lithuanian and most of the stuff you eat is boiled.  You know boiled chicken neck.  My great uncle lived to be 96.  You could give him $100 to eat something fried and he wouldn't touch it.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: But I don't even have mashed potatoes or French fries, I like rice.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good.  And uh are you still smoking?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: How much are you smoking?
PATIENT: Uh I smoke a pipe, maybe four or five times a day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's not no.
DOCTOR: Any interest in quitting?
PATIENT: No.  I like it.
DOCTOR: You understand the health risks though right?
PATIENT: Sure do.
DOCTOR: Okay so heart disease, stroke, lung disease.  You know we got those pulmonary function tests that were done.  That was a while ago, but you do have what looks like um emphysema or bronchitis.  So, you are having some lung damage and um that's probably why you've been short of breath too when you exert yourself.  Yesterday I just reviewed things and I could give you an inhaler called Combivent that you could use.  You use it every day twice a day okay and it might, this will help with your breathing when you exert yourself. Uh two puffs in the morning and two puffs in the evening and that way if you're like feeling like you could run a marathon you're breathing so good, still do, it okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And it'll help your breathing out.  Uh and but the best thing that you're going to do for that is to quit smoking okay.  So.
PATIENT: So really the amount that I puff on the pipe it's almost like not smoking because I don't inhale it that much.
DOCTOR: Yeah and your lungs have already suffered quite a bit of damage.  Like your pulmonary function tests your lung reserve is pretty low right now.  So you're like, as people age, as they get older their lung volume goes down.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's just normal aging.  Someone that smokes, their lung volume is going to go down really quickly okay.  If you were to stop smoking, you can't reverse the damage that's already occurred but you can go back on this normal slope so that the damage will occur less rapidly um so you know I'm afraid that if you continue to smoke, with your severe lung function uh it's gonna, you're going to end up being on oxygen and things like that, you're only 65, you need some more years in you.  Alright.  Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Did you ever?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay and one other test we need to do is that I would encourage you to do, we never got an ultrasound of your belly, looking for an aneurysm and any male over the age of 55 that's been smoking for five or more years, deserves a screening for this and it checks for the ballooning of the aorta in your belly.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um let's get that done okay; it's just a probe with some jelly on it, probably 20 minutes.
PATIENT: Will I have a foxy looking gal do it?
DOCTOR: Hopefully.  Not if you really want to get it at the VA though.
PATIENT: I don't care.
DOCTOR: I haven't seen too many foxy gals walking around here.
PATIENT: They used to have.
DOCTOR: Really?
PATIENT: Maybe guys like me chased them out.
DOCTOR: Are you getting any chest pain or pressure at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do you when you exert yourself?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Uh have you gotten a flu shot this year?
PATIENT: No.  I don't need it.
DOCTOR: Even with your lung function?  How many people do you think die from the flu every year?  Throw a number out.
PATIENT: Oh a couple thousand.
DOCTOR: 25,000 and that's not worldwide, that's in the United States.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That is a lot of people dying from the flu and uh and you have other medical conditions namely heart disease, diabetes and now lung disease so you're a high risk if you ever get the flu and it's still floating around.  We're actually seeing more flu cases now than we were a couple months ago.
PATIENT: Naw.
You're the only person, really only patient that that hasn't worked on.
PATIENT: (Laughter)  I don't scare easy.
DOCTOR: I'm not kidding you.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: I've had the most stubborn patient [REDACTED] today and I want you to have it.
PATIENT: Are you serious?
DOCTOR: I'm serious about it and it's safe.  What's the reservation about it?
PATIENT: I just don't want it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I mean are you concerned that you're going to get sick from it or?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: What about the pneumonia shot?
PATIENT: Na.
DOCTOR: So if the flu shot and the pneumonia shot protects you from the main bacteria that causes pneumonia [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I don't want to push it anymore.  I'm going to write refused the flu and Pneumovax vaccine.  How's your shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: Been okay?
PATIENT: Yeah okay.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah and have you thought any more about the cardiac catheterization?  Have you talked to your doctor DOCTOR about it?
PATIENT: Yeah, no.
DOCTOR: And you understand the risks of not going through that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh how's your swelling in your feet or your ankles?
PATIENT: None.
DOCTOR: You don't have any?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You’re still in that irregular rhythm but it's low.  [REDACTED].  Any uh, that's good.  We need to get some, I know you were just down in the Lab but [REDACTED].  Would you mind getting one more blood test, [REDACTED].  Um do you mind getting one more blood test, we might even be able to get you,  today just check out your kidney function cause you're on a really high dose of the water pill.  I just want to make sure that your kidneys are still functioning normally and we're not causing any damage to them with the high dose of the water pill [REDACTED] and we can also test your diabetes to make sure that's been controlled for the last three months.
PATIENT: You mean get that done now?
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll send you down as soon as we're done here.  Okay.  Did you used to smoke cigarettes too?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: When did you quit the cigarettes?
PATIENT: Oh, well actually it was when they raised the price and that was about four years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright have a seat up here, take off your shoes for me.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any sores on your feet at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: And you're checking feet daily?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  Take some deep breaths in and out.  Again.  Just breathe normally now.  Let me check the lungs okay.  Look that way, [REDACTED].  Okay.  Alright I really think you're gonna notice a difference with the inhaler. Your lungs sound a little wheezy.  [REDACTED]
PATIENT: I got the cold too.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]  yeah they definitely doesn’t help.  Okay let me just go talk to my supervisor about this stuff and I'll be right back.
(DOCTOR OUT:  38:29  DOCTOR IN:  45:15)
DOCTOR: Alright sir.  There are a few uh, [REDACTED] I talk to DOCTOR and she is in agreement with everything.  She said stop smoking, take your flu shot, get the Pneumovax.
PATIENT: (Laughter).
DOCTOR: Come back in six months and continue taking all your medications, including that lisinopril okay and go down to the Lab today to get your kidney function tests.
PATIENT: They know about the kidney function?
DOCTOR: Yeah I already wrote the order.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'll be down there.
DOCTOR: So take this to the check-out desk with you.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Take it easy.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
PATIENT: 45:52
