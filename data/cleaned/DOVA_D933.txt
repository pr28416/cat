DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Hey doc.
DOCTOR: How you doing today?
PATIENT: Doing fine, fine.
DOCTOR: Very good, very good.  Welcome back.
PATIENT: Oh you know I just did lab work you know done.
DOCTOR: Yeah on the 27th yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  [REDACTED] to get everything that I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No perfect, things really looked good.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um it looks like your [REDACTED].  You have no problems right now.  [REDACTED] um so far, anything new over the last three months?
PATIENT: No, no, no.  But you know he gave a phone call you know when the lab work came back and he was telling me that my potassium had been getting a little high and then I was telling him, you know I eat a lot of bananas and oranges, taking multivitamins you know he was just telling me well maybe I just need to delete the oranges and bananas you know.  I don't know.  I mean how high is it?  I mean it is.
DOCTOR: Uh right now uh, at least from the lab work that you did a couple of days ago it was 4.9 which is on the upper end of normal.  So the high would be at 5 and above.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know based on the lab testings here.  Um different lab tests have small differences in their testng.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But uh for here it shows borderline high.  Uh let's see here.
PATIENT: So what do you recommend, I just cut back on them or cut them off?
DOCTOR: Well yeah I would stay away, at least right now and you can do some dietary modification, maybe a low potassium diet um.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think I can print out, I think there's like a form that we can give you for that.  Um the other issue is the reason for it and it's likely just because of you know the chronic kidney disease issues that we already know about.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You know relating to your diabetes, the hypertension.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Those sorts of things and its stable but you know sometimes what happens is when your kidneys can't clear the potassium as well as a young healthy kidney.
PATIENT: Yeah.  You know he said something about the lisinopril.  He said.
DOCTOR: And so that's the other issue but you know I mean you have diabetes; you have chronic kidney disease, blood pressure issues.  There's a lot of indications for that lisinopril to be there.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And I hate to stop it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If it’s not I mean if your potassium was like 5.5, 6 like something that was above normal range.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I would stop it.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Because it could lead to you know problems down the road.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But right now it's just a high normal.  You know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Its, it's still normal, it's just you know when you look at it, from a physician’s standpoint like oh wow it's higher than what I normally see.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: To be honest most people have low potassium you know and so when we see a 4.9 we think it's high but it's actually normal.  But you know it definitely should be addressed.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I mean dietary is a good first step.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I'm gonna, I think either DOCTOR [REDACTED] our pharmacist should have a form on a low potassium diet.  So I'll get that for you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let me write this up.  It's not uncommon for patients on lisinopril and that have.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Kidney disease to have those kinds.  I think uh your blood pressure, excellent.  Still taking the amlodipine, lisinopril and atenolol?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Let's see here.  See if there are any issues; it looks like you saw the kidney doctor.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Uh recently, the 29th.  DOCTOR did absolutely nothing for you, said, “nice seeing you, see you in four months.”
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So obviously, uh you're not taking ibuprofen.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Indomethacin, nothing like the NSAID type medicines.
PATIENT: Right, right, right.  I think he said stay away from that.
DOCTOR: Yeah. Sounds good.  And definitely I know you have some of that colchicine left over there for the gout stuff but only take if you have a gout flare.
PATIENT: Right, right.  And you know I want to tell you something about that.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: You know like when I first had it, when it flared it up.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I took it and it you know took it a day or two and it, you know I'm guessing the gout; the pain subsided with everything else.
DOCTOR: Well that's good, that's good.
PATIENT: But, you know it happened before and I took that medication and you take it until the pain subsided or you develop diarrhea.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I developed diarrhea but I still had the pain you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I don't know.  The tests you run on me it comes back negative.
DOCTOR: The uric acid level or?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that can happen.
PATIENT: Yeah and then you know I went up to the foot doctor and he said that I bet it's gout, I bet it's gout and I said well the tests say it's not gout.  He said well you know when it flares up again call me up and he'll get some fluid off.  It swelled up, this was a year or so ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Swelled up, I comes out and I see the foot doctor and you got to make an appointment.  He told me to come in you know when it flares up right.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I just got frustrated and I just hobbled back to my car and went home you know.
DOCTOR: You know you could go to Urgent Care where that can be done.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But it's just if you get a flare-up again for whatever it was worth.
PATIENT: Well like you know, I'm gonna tell you, you know like I cut back on the green leafy vegetables like greens.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh no problem.  I don't know if that was the cause.
DOCTOR: Oh for the gout?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh that's odd.  I like your shoes by the way.
PATIENT: And they're really comfortable.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  They're very, very fashionable right now um so for the gout issues uh, so [REDACTED] leafy greens.  You know the main thing they do for gout is mostly like uh beers with a lot of grains.
PATIENT: Uh I'm not drinking any more.  I wasn't drinking in 12 years.
DOCTOR: And then like uh and red meats.  Those are the two big things that are for the most.  Cause gout, back in the day, historically was called the disease of kings.
PATIENT: Yeah, rich man.
DOCTOR: Yeah like the rich man’s disease.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Cause it happened like you know sort of [REDACTED] England, circa the 1400's you know people who have like beef and chicken.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: These were normally the rich people.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And so they were the ones who got gout and so that's kind of the things you would imagine the excesses of life, so a lot of red meat, beer, alcohol.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Those are the things you'd want to cut back on.  Not that that’s  anything that's going on.
PATIENT: Well what about that new medication they got now?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So um it's a good medication.  It's ridiculously expensive and I'm not exactly sure where it fits in.  I mean, so actually with talking about it, the medication itself is actually an old medication um and but much like colchicine, another medication for gout we already knew about, a lot of these companies are trying to take these old medications and give them a new indication and then re-brand them so they can charge more money to people.
PATIENT: Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yeah colchicine is like 60 or 70 years old so I guess.  Actually there's a company that bought the patent for it to create a new indication for it and now it's a very expensive medication.  I know it’s amazing, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Wherever there's a dollar to be made you know.  Um so I think in terms of [REDACTED] as a gout treatment, it's for people who have a refractory gout to - you're on allopurinol if you're getting multiple gout flares per year and you take colchicine and it doesn't go away, you take a medicine, you take prednisone, it kind of goes away but then comes back really quickly, that's one of the indications for it.  Is when you're failing standard, cheap, normal therapy.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Then you can start considering adding that in.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Um and so I think for right now we're doing okay, unless I missed my guess.
PATIENT: No, no I'm fine.  I haven't had a flare-up of that thing in a long time.
DOCTOR: I don't want you to.
PATIENT: No then I have something for it.
DOCTOR: Yeah sure, sure.
PATIENT: That glipizide, glyburide.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, I think you're on glipizide.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Is that possible, can you take that twice a day?
DOCTOR: Yes did we not go up on that for you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm still taking one pill a day and see what it is, I used to take it before meals uh right now my first meal normally is about maybe 5 o'clock and it was basically fruit.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Fruit you know maybe some vegetables and I eat late you know and I figured you know I don't know what the time set on that thing.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: And I took it this morning when I got up right.  Now I don't eat probably till 5 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Would it still like be in effective?
DOCTOR: Um so it can be taken twice a day.  Okay it can be taken you know around meals um so that's also something we can do.  Uh what I'm trying to think of, and that was the next thing and I'm glad you brought it up; we're eventually get to is the diabetes.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And uh your A1c that you drew on the 27th of April [REDACTED] uh so you know back in late 2010 it was 6.7 and it was well controlled.  Then it kind of spiked up in January to 8.6 um you know and generally for type 2 diabetes we want to get it around like 6.5 you know, for me that's a comfortable place for me without causing low blood sugar.  But 8.6 is high.  You've come down to 8.1 over the past couple of months but still above what I would like to see in terms of your average blood sugar.  The question is what do we add?  So your kidney function doesn't let us add metformin and in fact I’d say [REDACTED] a long time ago uh, that’s a first-line medication.  The glyburide we could try twice a day but the way, I'm sorry glipizide.  You can try twice a day but the way it works is it makes your pancreas essentially just secrete more insulin that what it normally would.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um the thing about it is that and we can see what it does but the question is are we going to get enough out of going to twice a day to go from 8.1 to like 6.5?
PATIENT: Well you know now you know I'm gonna get back into my you know bike riding.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know and I, the first time you know when they put me on that pill.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh I started to ride the bike and I noticed that I had I had a flat tire and repaired that and got back on it and had another flat and then I just started, you know and I didn't know exactly what to do so I called my office, whether you know he's a type 1 diabetic and he said check your blood sugar and I checked it and it was 33 you know and then uh he said well you've got to eat something.
DOCTOR: Now when was this?
PATIENT: This was when I first started taking that pill.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: And then I came back to the VA the next day and I spoke to a doctor and he said stop taking it you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And so I didn't take it for a couple years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then I just started back on that and I know once I start to work out riding the bike, cause I'll go 20-30 miles.
DOCTOR: Then it goes down.
PATIENT: And you know it would really drop it but I'm thinking you know if I increase those pills to twice a day you know I can take one when I eat my heavier meal you know and then it's not earlier so I may not have needed it.  If I have a prescription then I can pick that up and get it refilled and I'll have an ample supply.
DOCTOR: Exactly.  So you know um, you're checking your blood sugars again right?
PATIENT: You know what when I had to stop it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I left the home you know and I think everything's pretty good you know for me, you know for me like it'll be 90 you know 110.  It never run above 160.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Never run above 160.  And that was basically after a couple hours after a meal you know but you know it just stayed that way you know but I was thinking and I had the pills you know I said when I get up in the morning I'll take, you know I'll the glipizide, glyburide, whatever it is and I take the blood pressure medication you know and then I say you know I'm taking those pills and I'm not eating you know and I can take it twice a day you know.  I think that would work a lot better.  I don't know.
DOCTOR: Well you're not having any low blood sugars issues correct?  Like you haven't had hypoglycemia or anything lower than 60s?
PATIENT: No, no, no.
DOCTOR: Like you don't have any sweaty, dizziness?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] down.
PATIENT: No sweating, I get nervous.  But it seem like to me I just, you know I just, the numbers don't say it's low but like you said you know it might be how I just got to adjust it to you know high blood sugar levels.
DOCTOR: Out of curiosity, anyone in your family have diabetes?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] so no one's ever uh like no, I mean something more like parents, grandparents, great grandparents, you know that sort of thing like.
PATIENT: Oh you know what, okay you know what my.
DOCTOR: Like something like sickle cell traits.
PATIENT: My son has sickle cell traits.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So does your wife have sickle cell traits?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know where that come from but he says he told me you know, they said he had sickle cell traits you know, back then you know, I don't know.  Then my kid brother, I think I talked to you him about him before, he took the biopsy of his prostate.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that went south.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know and uh I don't know what they're gonna do about that but anyway he took the CAT scan and you know like I talk about that, saying my mother passed from colon cancer and you were talking about rescheduling me for the colon exam but I went up there and I checked and I'd had it like a little over a year ago.  But anyway he went in for a CAT scan and I guess they discovered something in the stomach but he took a colonoscopy and that was fine but then they went in the 19th of May and they removed a tumor in the stomach and my sister she's an RN and she works out at Hines, she [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Did she tell you what it was?
PATIENT: Yeah so I don't know, he knows, I don't know.  I got him to come in and get an AA card and he did a check-up and then you know the thinks I'm gonna tell him what I told you so I told you so, so you know like sibling rivalry, or whatever, but anyway he's up there.  They go in, they take this out and you know, you probably know they probably could tell by looking at it if it was benign I don't know.  Then the gallbladder.  You know he was complaining about his stomach.  They said when they went in they said he was full of gallstones and they took the gallbladder out you know.  He's probably still here, I don't know.  He's supposed to be, you know released but when they took the gallbladder out you know until he make a bowel movement they said he can't hold any food down you know.  But uh that's that thing that's why I try to stay on top of the PSA and my gut you know cause [REDACTED].  That's everything about that.
DOCTOR: Your PSA was normal uh in January.  Uh your colonoscopy was in 2006 but uh they wanted a repeat in five years.  Where was it done, was it done here in 2006?
PATIENT: Right.  Well now it wasn't that long ago.
DOCTOR: But was it done here though?
PATIENT: Yeah.  It was done here.  I'd say what, 8; I think it's three of them I've had here.
DOCTOR: I'll take a look and just see, they said repeat it in five years.  I would suggest, I don't know if that's because of family history or did they tell you at that point that they found a polyp?
PATIENT: That's what I understand; they said they found a polyp.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well the first time they found one it was so small and then you know they said they took it out, they couldn’t do a biopsy on it.
DOCTOR: Yeah and this last time, usually when they say five years it's because they found um like a tubular adenoma or something like that.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Yeah I think they found one the last time.  But it seem like I just had it like two years ago.
DOCTOR: Well uh December 06 was the last time here but you think you had one more recently?
PATIENT: I'm pretty sure I had one more recently than 06.
DOCTOR: I was just [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You talking about five years.
DOCTOR: July 2010 okay.  Okay you never know.  Um let's see here, they found, 6 mm polyp in the sigmoid, no other polyps in the colon.  Okay so that was July @@.
PATIENT: July of 2010?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah you're okay then.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So yeah they found both those it looks like back together so that, yeah tubular adenoma so repeat in five years so you don't need to come back until 2015.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Good, okay.  [REDACTED].  The only other thing is we just need a repeat of a liver ultrasound just for your yearly screening.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: This is [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.  Now they'll send me a letter, they'll send me a letter for that right?
DOCTOR: Uh we can actually schedule it today if you want to.  It doesn't have to be done today but.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, I could go downstairs today.
DOCTOR: Yeah the last one was @@/@@/@@ so it's about time for that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Other than that, give me a couple of minutes and I'll come back and you know otherwise I think we're looking good.  I'll talk to DOCTOR about going up on the glipizide.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: It could be you know and I don't know if we need to, so if you can't do the metformin, and glipizide you know you don't want to do multiple medications in the same class.  There's another medication called Actos, pioglitazone but it causes a little weight gain um.
PATIENT: I don't want to see that.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean that's the biggest complaint.  People quit it because on average people gain like 5-10 pounds in like water weight.
PATIENT: I want to lose 15 pounds.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.  And people everywhere complain about it so beyond that then we start talking about fancier medications um like Januvia and Byetta and some of the other kind of fancy medications and then after that its insulin.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So let's try to see what we can do.
PATIENT: I think if I drop about 20-25 pounds.  I need to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Weight loss, exercise, diet, those will help immensely.
PATIENT: Okay.  You got, you say [REDACTED] you want to give me the script for the.
DOCTOR: Okay yeah I'll be right back and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.  Alright.
DOCTOR: Give me a couple of minutes.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  31:10  DOCTOR IN:  41:32)
DOCTOR: So [REDACTED] talk about it.  You know I, we came to an agreement, let’s try to go with glyburide twice a day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um because of the issues of like the hypoglycemia in the past and you [REDACTED] but let's spread the medication out a little bit so you're not taking it all at one time so I want you to ride your bike but you can't have your blood sugars [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah well you know I'm going to be keeping track of my blood sugar so uh you know I could just monitor the blood sugar when I'm checking it so.  When I ride you know I take about three candy bars with me anyway.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know cause I just [REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: Now you should always have, everyone with diabetes should have a little sugar thing on them but actually give me a second, I’m printing something out.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: This is kind of a list of things that have high potassium.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: This is sort of the avoid list, but not 100%.  You don't have to avoid everything cause there's a lot of stuff on there that's good for you but the other thing is you know, like anything with like a really high number.  Like 400, so like you know bananas, kind of like dates, you know that sort of thing.  Like try to avoid the ones that have like the really high numbers, what's 65, beets, oh.  I don't even know [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You know what I'm gonna tell you something.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Bananas and I just devour two cantaloupes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Yeah.
PATIENT: I wonder if that brought it up cause I've been eating cantaloupe and the seasonal fruit.
DOCTOR: No you can eat it yeah.  I'm just saying you know its other things where you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's just good to maybe find something off of it by dietary means you know it's sort of like you know it's more like an informational type you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We're talking.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's not something that's 100%.
PATIENT: Right well if I eat the cantaloupe then I just lay off the bananas.
DOCTOR: Sounds good.
PATIENT: I can eat bananas anytime though.
DOCTOR: And that's excellent [REDACTED].  So I gave you the form.  So I'll change your medications in the computer too um so we'll do a three month follow-up with the Pharm D with the A1c and everything.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But can you give me a prescription for that?
DOCTOR: I'll get it for you.
PATIENT: I'll pick it up today [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: VA appointment, you'll come back and see me in six months.
PATIENT: Great.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] glipizide.
PATIENT: You gonna send me for lab work?
DOCTOR: Uh yes.  We need to get it obviously and so right before you see the pharmacist.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I'll put it in the computer to be drawn like 2-2 1/2 months from now, you just kind of come in whenever.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So we can get your level like before that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And so we'll recheck the A1c next time.  So I'll make sure you get your lab work.
PATIENT: Well you know I just as well, since I'm gonna pick them up I can come back and take the blood work you know maybe a couple of weeks before I see you.
DOCTOR: Well I would like for you to take it before you see the pharmacist cause they would actually try to make a change.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: In any of your medications.
PATIENT: Oh you gonna send me to the pharmacist?
DOCTOR: Yeah in three months for the pharmacist.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And in six months to see me.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The pharmacist can manage the A1c number otherwise you’re too healthy to be coming back to see me.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh let's see I want to make sure [REDACTED] yeah so we've got.  I'll set that up in the computer.
PATIENT: Right [REDACTED] baked potatoes [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh let's see, what is today? [REDACTED].  I think every single time you come in I'll have you go check with her and see which one it is.
PATIENT: Okay.  I gotta tell you something, looking at this here I'm killing myself with potassium.  Sweet potatoes.
DOCTOR: Well sweet potatoes have potassium but they’re so [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's it, that's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Do you get your prescriptions in like the 90 or 30 day rate?
PATIENT: 90.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll put them in here for your refills.
PATIENT: No, [REDACTED]  For the, not blood pressure but for the.
DOCTOR: For the Pharmacy?
PATIENT: For the Pharmacy.
DOCTOR: I'll give it to you and you give it to [REDACTED] or one of them up front.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And uh they'll make an appointment with NAME for about three months or so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I'll put it in the computer to follow up with me in six months.  So in about five months or so you'll get a letter saying to come back.
PATIENT: Okay.  Are you putting it in the computer before I go and get for the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: I'll put in the order for the ultrasound but you'll need to schedule the date and time.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Or yeah you can still go there and do that and then the lab work I'll put in but you won't be able to take it until probably about two months or so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll put like the start date cause the order will last 30 days in system, so maybe about a month before the Pharmacy appointment you can come in and have your labs.
PATIENT: Okay so when I come into the Pharmacy appointment well I just going to put on a Thursday to remind me to put the lab work in for my visit cause I'll be seeing you three months after that.
DOCTOR: Um I can put it in for myself also, that'll be fine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Good.  Good seeing you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Thanks a lot doc.
DOCTOR: Good thing [REDACTED] that one yeah.
PATIENT: Same here.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's right.
