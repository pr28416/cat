PATIENT: Let me do that.
DOCTOR: You want to do it?
PATIENT: Yeah.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] one of these.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] finger there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: There you go.
PATIENT: Is that it?  That's [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's it.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Not bad.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  120 and under.
DOCTOR: That's good; I mean it should be when you wake up in the morning.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's what we, now if you take your Glargine at night when you wake up in the morning it needs to kind of 120 or under.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Now what did you eat today?
PATIENT: Uh well [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What have you eaten today?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What time?
PATIENT: Around 12 noon.
DOCTOR: Did you [REDACTED] before that?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So it's about 4 o'clock now.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay so it's just four hours post prandially so it still might be a little bit high.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um.  Maybe what we can do is we can check your A1c.  If your A1c is really high.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh then maybe I could give you a call and I could tell you to just increase your Glargine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um but if it's fine then we can keep it as is okay.  We just made a change recently so you said it's still high.  Your morning blood sugars are still high.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Well then before I had, I had one low.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I had one low level [REDACTED] 98.
DOCTOR: Those are great.
PATIENT: Right.  [REDACTED] before, before they increased it.
DOCTOR: Before the change.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You said since the change your sugars have been higher?
PATIENT: Right.  And I was thinking uh that the Glargine is the long-acting, 20 and then I was taking uh the 70/30.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I was taking 80 and 80.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Of that.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: And uh [REDACTED] cause it was lower [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: My suspicion.. but the 70/30.  Before, you were taking your blood sugar, you thought your blood sugar was more controlled with the 70/30 and the Glargine?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So but what we just need to do is titrate up or increase what you're on now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Right.  Uh it's a little bit of a better you know regimen.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay.
DOCTOR: So let me see.  I think we'll check the A1c today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And kind of see where it's at.  I think if you're taking the 24 with meals and you're taking 20 just at night before you go to bed.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And your blood sugars in the morning are still high; they're still very high right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um we should.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You're doing a lot of pop.
PATIENT: Well not, no maybe one.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Do you want to quit that?
PATIENT: Yes I do.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Yes I do.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um let's do that.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well it's tough for me to really know what to change when I don't see the blood sugar records okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Let's take a look at your A1c; if it's still high then we'll consider increasing your Glargine dose.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Probably we'll probably do that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I need to know also what your blood sugars are a couple hours after you eat and when you take the insulin with it because we need to make sure that that insulin, okay is accurate.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So again, bring in your blood glucose log in a month.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: We want to know what the morning is and we also want to know what it is two hours after you give yourself insulin in the evening.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Those are important to know.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Right so we need to know if we need to increase the dose.
PATIENT: Right [REDACTED] it's pretty accurate.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm going to be right back okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] possible [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: To what?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] Secretary of State [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I don't know if I need to take a look at what else is going on.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: This is the part that's the problem okay.  And they're being a little bit more stringent with us.  Cannot walk 200 feet without stopping to rest does no longer qualify them for disability.
PATIENT: I see.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So I don't think because you can walk okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Right?
PATIENT: Right.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah but I don't think unless there is one of the following conditions okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Lung disease which I don't think you have.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right uh you don't have a heart condition.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Uh you walk on your own; you don't have an assistive device.  You don't have [REDACTED] or orthopedic condition that's severe right.  So I don't know if you necessarily qualify.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Let's hope you don't.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright, hold on one second okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  46:35  DOCTOR IN:  63:47)
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I think what we're gonna do, because your blood sugars are so high in the morning, in the 200s.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We want to increase your nighttime insulin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we're going to increase it from 20 to 25.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know what you need to do if you feel low blood sugars right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: I want you to then come down.  If you get low blood sugars in the morning.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I want you to come down back to 20.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So you're gonna be taking Glargine 20.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then the long-acting.  At night, tell me what you're taking, tell me what you're gonna be taking.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] 24.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: And [REDACTED] 24, then 25 at bedtime.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good.
