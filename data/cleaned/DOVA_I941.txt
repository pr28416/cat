PATIENT: You had it.
DOCTOR: Oh no it's okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] now friend.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I want to listen to it and see.  Remember the last time you were here we talked about how this was the first time coming to the doctor it was kind of a new thing for you.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So it kind of takes some time to get used to all of the medications and how to take them and all that stuff.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But what I want you to remember is you don't feel sick but you have a very sick heart and you have a sick body and you need to take the medications seriously, so as long as you understand that you need to make sure you review your medication list and you take them as it's written.  Are you taking the medication called Plavix?  The one they told you to stop because of the foot surgery?
PATIENT: Hmm.  I think it's called Plavix or another name for it.
DOCTOR: Clopidogrel?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah did you stop that one like you were supposed to?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay are you taking your aspirin yeah?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: You restarted the.
PATIENT: Started taking it again.
DOCTOR: Okay good but no Plavix, no clopidogrel.
PATIENT: You told me to stop taking that.
DOCTOR: Good.  Are you having any problems with your medications or do you have any questions about them?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Now the medications were the main thing I was worried about last time and again what's the most important thing in terms of how your health is doing?  Do you remember what we talked about?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You don't remember?
PATIENT: And I'm not drinking anymore.
DOCTOR: That was one of the big ones was the drinking.
PATIENT: Yeah I stopped drinking.
DOCTOR: And then other big one was uh your heart.
PATIENT: My heart.
DOCTOR: So you understand it right.
PATIENT: Right I can't do no more exercising, no [REDACTED] stuff like that?
DOCTOR: So you still do that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My blood pressure is back to, what was it 135 is what it was.
DOCTOR: Yeah and for you.
PATIENT: It was 180 at one time, I remember that.
DOCTOR: Do you know what your goal blood pressure should be?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So because you have heart disease, now when I say heart disease I was talking about the blockages in your heart.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Because you had that, your goal blood pressure should be 120 on the top and 80 on the bottom and you're about that right now.
PATIENT: 135 yeah.  I thought, I asked the lady and she said that's normal.
DOCTOR: She didn't know you had all these other, it's normal for somebody who doesn't have heart disease.
PATIENT: Normal for normal people.
DOCTOR: Yeah but you're not normal anymore.
PATIENT: I ain't normal man.
DOCTOR: So we don't mean it in a bad way we mean it in just the, that way we identify you as somebody we need to take close care of.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So your heart doesn't get you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm not saying your abnormal to make you feel bad.  We just say that you don't have a normal heart anymore; you have blockages in the arteries and that.
PATIENT: What causing it?  The food I eat?
DOCTOR: The food you eat, the cholesterol you have, high blood pressure, all those things combined.
PATIENT: Blocks the heart.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So.
PATIENT: Exercise don't help?
DOCTOR: It does help but it doesn't take away all the other problems.
PATIENT: Hmm.  Okay.
DOCTOR: It builds up over time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you've stopped drinking all together?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Wow, that's very good.
PATIENT: Well I'd say coming from me that is good.
DOCTOR: When was your last drink?
PATIENT: About two months ago.
DOCTOR: You didn't have any problems trying to go back to the bottle or wanting to drink more?
PATIENT: Hmm.  I tell you what, I don't want any more, cause I quit drinking before.
DOCTOR: Good, good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Cause the liver, it's gonna cause you a lot of trouble.
PATIENT: Cause that's [REDACTED] when I worked.

DOCTOR: You walk up and down flights of stairs?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: How many stairs do you go up at night?
PATIENT: I go up two flights.
DOCTOR: Do you have any problems with chest pain?
PATIENT: Sometimes shortness of breath, sometimes pain you know, it stops me, I get dizzy, lightheaded.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]
PATIENT: I think that my blood pressure.  Do you get dizzy.
DOCTOR: Uh this also could be from the heart.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: The blood pressure has to be really low to give you those symptoms.
PATIENT: To make you dizzy?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My blood pressure is high.
DOCTOR: Exactly, I don't know if that's it.
PATIENT: Yeah.  But if I exercise or over exercise I get dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I get dizzy and I stop.
DOCTOR: Do you have it every time you go up the stairs?
PATIENT: Not all the time, just if I overdo it you know.
DOCTOR: Now since they put that stent in your heart, has it become less frequent?  Do you notice you're doing better since then or is it the same?
PATIENT: The same. The same. I did notice I get the dizziness sometimes after [REDACTED] short winded.
DOCTOR: Alright.  What other questions do you have for me today, sir?
PATIENT: None.
DOCTOR: None.  Do you remember um the last time you were here you also told me you were having some problems with peeing at night and um you know you were going to the bathroom pretty frequently and we talked about it.

DOCTOR: No that's fine.
PATIENT: Munich, Dachau, the whole of Germany.
DOCTOR: And you were in Vietnam.
PATIENT: Oh man [REDACTED] I saw [REDACTED]
SECOND PERSON I941
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: I [REDACTED] we were digging holes laying in the ground.
SECOND PERSON I941
Wow.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: The reason why I was asking you was I was wanting to know if any of that stuff with you wanting to drink and stuff like that.  Do you ever have flashbacks?
PATIENT: Oh plenty of them yeah, plenty of them.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] about that.  All that stuff in Vietnam.
DOCTOR: What do you think about your old days of partying and the fact that now you're 59 and you have blockages in your heart and a bad liver.
PATIENT: I have to slow down the party you know.
DOCTOR: That’s all I want to hear.
PATIENT: Slow down that party.
DOCTOR: You understand that right?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Yeah I still going around peaking at parties you know and what's been going on, man I'm giving it a little break, that's the end of the conversation.  That's [REDACTED] alright.  I'm not drinking right now.
DOCTOR: Did you get your colonoscopy yet?
PATIENT: Is that where they put you in the MRI [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh MRI.
PATIENT: MRI.
DOCTOR: No the colonoscopy is the one where.
PATIENT: You get to drink all this stuff.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah I did that yeah.
DOCTOR: But they said they were going to schedule it but I don't think they did it did they?
PATIENT: Yeah they did it.
DOCTOR: When?
PATIENT: I think it was a colonoscopy?  They put me in a MRI and.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: I drank a lot of stuff.
DOCTOR: Oh that's something different yeah.
PATIENT: PET, [REDACTED] on the first floor.
DOCTOR: No that's another one, that's something different.  The colonoscopy is they make a drink a prep overnight that makes you poop all night long cleans out your entire bowels and then they put you to sleep while they put a camera in your rectum and they look for cancers in your intestines.  You have not had that.  I think people remember that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  I think they talked to you about it in the GI and explained to you that the reason why they want to do it is uh everyone is supposed to have one at the age of 50 okay.  It's a screening for colon cancer.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And the reason why we do it is because colon cancer is one of the few cancers that if you catch it, while it's still like a little small couple of cells that are growing in your intestines we can see we cut it out and its gone and we just have to do a follow-up test later.  If we don't look for it, we don't catch it and it becomes a cancer and grows into the stomach, goes through the walls of the colon, just through the walls of the colon and then it goes to other places.  Once it spreads past the colon.
PATIENT: What does the colon do anyhow?
DOCTOR: The colon is the large intestines, that's all it is.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: The large intestines.
PATIENT: Pancreas.
DOCTOR: Pancreas is different.  That helps you digest food.  The colon helps you pass the food out and makes stool but that's the second highest form of cancer Americans get.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The only thing more than that is lung cancer.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: But the colon cancer is the only one we can actually look at, cut out and stop it before it becomes a cancer.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So they wanted to do it but then they got worried that you were on that blood thinner.
PATIENT: Right, right, right.
DOCTOR: So now that you've stopped it, I think we should probably have you go back and get that done, what do you think?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: You'll go for it?
PATIENT: Yes.  In order to get a lot of years.  I love my Sci Fi.  [REDACTED].  Comic books, science fiction.
DOCTOR: What kind of comic books?
SECOND PERSON I941
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Flash Gordon, [REDACTED].  Doctor Who.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Um your blood pressure's better um but we need to get it even lower by you know the next time you come.
PATIENT: Will I still be breathing?
DOCTOR: Well do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Do you want to pick up one today so that we can actually have you check your blood pressures at home?
PATIENT: I can check my own blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Yeah you just put a cuff on your arm, press the button and the machine reads it up to you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And that way, actually bring it when you come in.
PATIENT: So what happens if it's too high or too low?
DOCTOR: I want you to write it down.
PATIENT: Call 911.
DOCTOR: No.  I want you to write them down and the next time you come see me bring in the sheet of the blood pressures you wrote down.
PATIENT: I take the blood every day?
DOCTOR: One in the morning and one in the evening.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Do it for like two weeks and then write them down and bring them in.  Cause if something like you know if your blood pressure's like 140/90 that's not good enough but you're like but here it shows every day I'm 120/80 at home, maybe I just don't like you and that's why my blood pressure goes up.  We'll leave it at that and we won't change your medications.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But if you’re continuously high then we need to change it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The same thing, when you come to see, we'll reschedule the Pharmacy visit.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: When you come in to see the pharmacist uh.
PATIENT: You going to reschedule that for me?
DOCTOR: Yeah, so when you come in to see her, she can actually even look at the blood pressure medications, blood pressures and decide what we need to give you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And she'll just put it under my name.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So why don't we pick up a blood pressure cuff today.
PATIENT: I can get that today.
DOCTOR: Yeah and then once we get that going, for the next two weeks write down your blood pressures and we'll move your Pharmacy visit back two weeks.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Sound okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um now let me try to remember where you get your blood pressure.
