DOCTOR: OK, when you say the past couple of days, do you mean two days, three days, four days?
PATIENT: I would say the last two days, yeah, just yesterday and today.
DOCTOR: OK, so loss of taste, so you can't taste anything or you can only taste some things or you're just not getting the full depth of your taste?
PATIENT: Yeah, I really noticed it with the pizza, but with like other things too, it's just a yeah, really plain, it doesn't  really have any flavor with the food that I'm eating.
DOCTOR: OK, so it kind of tastes like cardboard.
PATIENT: Yeah, kind of, and I think, like, I mean part of that is that I maybe not smelling it as well either.

DOCTOR: OK, good good. Do you think that this morning you were dizzy because you were dehydrated? Or is this like a normal thing for you?
PATIENT: I mean, I guess I could have been dehydrated. I didn't even think of that, but I mean, since the food didn't taste so great, I don't know. I probably didn't eat as much yesterday or the last couple of days. Maybe I haven't eaten as much.

DOCTOR: I'll just continue on asking you some other questions. Do you drink alcohol?

DOCTOR: Oh, that's nice. And any concerns with the living arrangements in terms of you know, like it being an old building, old carpets, mold, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I live in a nice place. It's usually like really clean.
DOCTOR: OK, good, umm alright, so those are all the questions I had for you. Did you have any questions or any concerns that you wanted to bring up?
PATIENT: I guess the only thing that I was concerned about was possibly having COVID.
DOCTOR: Yeah, you know, that's probably top on my list of things to investigate you for, so I would say COVID or other viral illnesses that could be going around this time of year. That would have less of a similar presentation, and so we will do a COVID swab for you. And in the meantime, if you could isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether the swab comes back positive or negative, and that would be great. If the swab comes back positive, we will notify public health and they'll try to trace where you could have caught this from and if it turns out it's not a viral illness, we will try to work you up for any bacterial infections which can be treated with antibiotics. So that's where we will start, does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense.
DOCTOR: OK great, well have a great day.
PATIENT: Yeah, thank you.
