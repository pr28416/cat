THIRD PERSON M224
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright.
SECOND PERSON M224
That's usually [REDACTED].
THIRD PERSON M224
[REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON M224
[REDACTED].
THIRD PERSON M224
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: This one is not for water, the furosemind is right?
DOCTOR: Well the furosemide is the water pill.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: That makes you pee and the lisinopril is a blood pressure medicine and it helps protect your kidneys when you have diabetes and you have diabetes so it's good for that too.
PATIENT: Okay.
THIRD PERSON M224
All these medicines, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Now that one make sure you're on the service connection things.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright so your medications are all done.
PATIENT: I ordered them on the internet too which is cool.
DOCTOR: Oh good yeah that's cool.  Now the last thing I wanted to figure out is what we're gonna do about your pain because it's just not good to take so much of that tramadol.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now the other thing I follow which is pretty weird I have diabetes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh man I was really runny low.  I was getting down on my blood sugar count was down in the 50s and 60s.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: But the wife give me some hard candy to eat.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: These little sucker things.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They're all in a wrapper.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And you take and you, I got in the habit now of sticking about eight of them at a time.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then I feel really good and then I don't even take that pain medicine so much.  I don't know where it works together at.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Because you know it don't make any sense right?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Yeah how often are you having real lows with your sugars?
PATIENT: Oh not too often just very seldom.
DOCTOR: Very seldom okay.
PATIENT: Yeah when I run out of candy I suck a lot of that candy all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you don't have, you don't take insulin do you?
PATIENT: No I just take the pills, the glipizide and the metformin.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's what it's for right?
DOCTOR: Okay so yeah this is my thought then okay.  When we get your labs done, if your blood sugar is still as controlled as it has been in the past maybe we'll try to take the glipizide off and just do the metformin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because the metformin works in a little bit different way and doesn't cause any lows.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Glipizide can cause some lows.
PATIENT: Okay, okay.
DOCTOR: And if you're still well controlled like you have been in the past.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Maybe we can stop the glipizide and then check you again.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know in a little bit okay.
PATIENT: And that'll be another pill off the list right?
DOCTOR: Yeah and so then we just want to make sure though with the glipizide that you're eating on a regular basis.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: You know, eat regular meals.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: And things like that okay.
PATIENT: Right, right.  Okay.

DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: What it's got to do with that but I used to think it was my shirts once in a while but it's got to be the uh, I don't know of course then I got arthritis.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: What kind of arthritis I got, I got some other crap.
DOCTOR: So let's see what they thought they were gonna do.  Okay alright well maybe we'll talk about hooking you up with the physical therapist again to see if they can give you any exercises that help your pain because we're, you're not getting very good control here with the tramadol and you can't take as much of it regularly as you are.
PATIENT: Well the tramadol is not only for my neck and shoulders; it's for my back and my legs.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON M224
If I'd brought my inhaler I wouldn't be in this predicament.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths in and out.  Can you lay back for me so I can take a look?  Your cough doesn't sound good.
SECOND PERSON M224
I know.
PATIENT: It's really bad and [REDACTED].  She does that at night when we're sleeping.
SECOND PERSON M224
Oh be quiet.
PATIENT: It wakes me up when I'm asleep.
SECOND PERSON M224
Oh boo hoo.
PATIENT: It's like being in a combat zone.
SECOND PERSON M224
Boo hoo.
DOCTOR: Any belly pain?
PATIENT: Uh no not right now.  Oh yeah right there was one.
DOCTOR: Any pain that’s new?
PATIENT: I think [REDACTED] telling you what's wrong.  It feels like really weird here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Of course I got a little pain down there where [REDACTED] I think that's where the stich was when they went in.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And you know it's just.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] your stuff.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Any swelling in your legs at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Now this one I had a [REDACTED] one and that's where I tripped, its turning purple, yellow.
DOCTOR: Is it getting better now?
PATIENT: Oh yes much better.  You can hardly see it now.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  Okay alright you can sit back up and I'm going to push that in.  Alright you can come on down here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Alright so a few things [REDACTED].  So screening things it looks like you would be due for an ultrasound of your abdomen.  Have you ever had one of those?
PATIENT: Uh maybe.  I don't know I've had different things done up here.  Sometimes multi-times but it's always good to have just in case.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So we recommend that once you turn 65 years old, if you smoked more than a pack of cigarettes in your entire life you should get an ultrasound of your belly to look at your aorta down in your belly to make sure that it's not dilated at all.
PATIENT: Oh they've already run that thing down my throat to come to find out that I have a hiatal hernia.
DOCTOR: Hiatal hernia.
PATIENT: They gave me a purple pill one time and they took it away I don't know why.
DOCTOR: Nexium probably.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So that will look into your stomach.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and this is a little bit different so I think if you don't have any objections I'll just order that study.
PATIENT: Oh that thing that they run around your stomach with uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's like an ultrasound like they're looking for a baby in.
PATIENT: Yeah they put this goop on your.
DOCTOR: Like the same as yeah.
SECOND PERSON M224
You've already had this?
THIRD PERSON M224
Yeah of the heart.
DOCTOR: Yeah so you've had an ultrasound of your kidneys before.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: That's the same thing.
PATIENT: Not too long ago.
DOCTOR: The same they they just look at your aorta.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay um so we'll do, I'll put in the order for that.  They'll call you to set it up.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now instead of having that uh colonoscopy again.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I know you’re supposed to.  They did it twice up here a while back.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But instead of doing that isn't there something else they can do?
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: That accomplishes the same deal?
DOCTOR: They can do um, we can do cards.  Let me see what your last colonoscopy showed and when you need to do it again.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um do you remember ever having polyps?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Or when you had your colonoscopy did they take any samples out or tell you anything?
PATIENT: I'm not sure of any of that.  Yeah cause they must have because the first time they said some [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  In 2006 it looks like.
PATIENT: Yeah see we cheated because it was a whole two days, that's tough before you did the thing and then they did it in a different way when you drink that junk.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And you didn't have to do the [REDACTED] a big white bottle, they changed all that so you only did the white bottle.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they come to find out I guess what in the first eight inches or something like this and ask her, they got to go over something.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They could go on up, they had a problem.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And it hurt like a sucker.
DOCTOR: So it looks like, from what I can tell uh they took some biopsies but there was nothing uh.
PATIENT: It was clean and green.  I understand that they said I didn't have any cancer.
DOCTOR: Yes.  Yep.
PATIENT: Cancer clean.
DOCTOR: Yep no cancers, no cancer.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So um they're looking no polyps, nothing in the colon so they didn't even find any polyps.  They actually just took a few biopsies cause you had been having some abdominal pain or something.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So you had a clean colonoscopy in 2006 which means you're not due again until 2016.
PATIENT: Oh great!
DOCTOR: So you don't have to worry about that.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: Quite yet okay.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: So that's good and then the final um.
PATIENT: Cause the worse thing about the colonoscopy is drinking the white crap.
DOCTOR: You have to drink the white stuff.
PATIENT: And [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And you know your tushy gets so sick after drinking that crap.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know toilet paper, I don't know if the toilet paper even works right but.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So we're almost done here.  Um the only other thing.  So there are two things left, one is that I have to tell you I recommend highly that you stop smoking and you stop smoking and if you stop smoking and no smoking in the house, that's just for your health and everything that we know.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: It's very important.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So if there's anything that I can do to help you with that, including setting you up with the Smoking Cessation Clinic here for uh if you are interested in nicotine patches you know I can and will provide those to you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so do you want me to set any of those up for you?
PATIENT: Nicotine patches?
DOCTOR: Nicotine patch.
PATIENT: Can you do that yes.
DOCTOR: I can.  You smoke very few cigarettes.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So you don't.
PATIENT: So yeah.
DOCTOR: I can set you up with the lowest.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Dose.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Of the nicotine patches.
PATIENT: Cause the last time I was here, the night they made me stay over.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah they put nicotine patches on me too.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think they switched one, you know but I know that yeah they used them over here.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  So I'll do that for you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so that'll be good.
PATIENT: Now the wife may not successfully quit but I have to.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: I've had two strokes.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: Two heart attacks.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: I got four stents.
DOCTOR: Yep you got to quit smoking.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You gotta quit smoking.
PATIENT: Okay doc.
DOCTOR: Okay cause you've got a lot of issues that are related.  Especially with your Agent Orange history with both of those combined.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You gotta quit smoking um and then the last uh screening thing is that the VA recommends that every veteran between the ages of 18 and 120 get screened at least one time for HIV so I can order that blood test for you for the next time you come in and get labs done.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you don't mind.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That'll be the 31st.
DOCTOR: That'll be the 31st and we'll get some labs done then.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I think you're up-to-date, let me check your immunizations to make sure.  You had the flu shot, you got the pneumonia shot.  Um the only other thing is for your tetanus shot, you had the tetanus shot in 2010 and those last in and of themselves 10 years before you need another booster so technically you're not due for the tetanus part until 2020 but the new tetanus vaccinations also protect against whooping cough.
PATIENT: Okay I'll take it.
DOCTOR: So I'll get you that today before you leave okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright so we'll do that.  Alright so I'm just gonna go talk to my supervisor quick but I think your blood pressure's well controlled.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Hopefully your diabetes is as well controlled as it was back the last time it was checked but we'll check it again at the end of the month.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: If that's still okay we'll talk about going down on that glipizide.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: To make sure you know stop you from having those lows.  Um we'll get you set up with the nicotine patches, with the tetanus shot and with the triple A screen and then we'll see you back sometime soon okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So let me just uh, let me just go talk to them and I'll be back okay.
PATIENT: Okay doc.
DOCTOR: I think I'm also going to try to get you hooked up with the physical therapist again cause I want to see what, if anything, they can do to help with your pain.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Any more questions right now?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Okay doc.
DOCTOR: Alright.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Do we need to talk about [REDACTED].
(DOCTOR OUT:  87:37  DOCTOR IN:  95:55)
DOCTOR: Okay so.  Alright just like I said we're gonna do what we talked about so I'm going to order you the ultrasound of your abdomen and they'll call you to set that up.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  They might be able to set it up for you before you leave so let me put the order in right now and see.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um.
SECOND PERSON M224
Where does he get that shot at?
DOCTOR: He gets it right here before he leaves so I will put in the order okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Uh if you could do it on the 31st, would you want to do it all on one day and just have?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Everything, let's see if they can do that.
PATIENT: Sure would.
DOCTOR: Okay so we'll do that, let me do.
PATIENT: So I think my appointment is at 1:30 or 2 in the afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: On the 31st.
DOCTOR: Okay we'll order your tetanus.  Okay and the nicotine patches.  Do you want to pick up the nicotine patches or do you want them mailed to you?
PATIENT: You can mail them to me.
DOCTOR: Mail them to you okay then I'll do that so you won't have to wait for that.  So we'll get some labs done at the end of the month when you come back.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: We'll get this triple A screen, we'll get you the tetanus shot and we'll get you the patches um and okay.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: We refilled all of your medicines so you should be set there um how about now I'm trying to think when I want to see you back.  So how about in the next 3-4 months.
PATIENT: Okay that'd be fine.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That'll be fine yes.
DOCTOR: And then next time I'll have my card with me and I'll give you my card but I can give you the number if you want.
PATIENT: Okay.  Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  There's the phone number.
PATIENT: Excellent, alright.
DOCTOR: Alright and for your pain I'm going to set you up with PT again.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay the Physical Therapy.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I want you to really try to take the tramadol as prescribed.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I don't want to just throw medicine at you because medicines cause you know, they're not and they have other problems and so I don't want to keep just adding things to all of your pills.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: That you're already taking.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So if you can do your best to take the tramadol as prescribed and I'll get the physical therapy set up and then maybe they'll have some recommendations for you know stretches or treatment or something.
PATIENT: They've already done that twice, they come out to the house.
DOCTOR: Yeah and it looks like from what I could see when they came out to the house it was mostly to kind of evaluate for the scooter and that type of thing.
PATIENT: No I was, I had a stroke and heart attacks that's why they did it.
DOCTOR: Okay so they came out for that.
PATIENT: Now they assessed for the scooter right downstairs here.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay, okay.
PATIENT: Cause we only wanted a simple wheelchair but they wouldn't give me one.
DOCTOR: They wouldn't give you one yeah.  I think they thought it would have been too hard with all your cardiac issues I think they said.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so we'll keep working on that okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: We'll work on your pain.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And it'll kind of be what we talk about okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: And see what else we can do.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay now I will limit the use of them things.
DOCTOR: Okay and at the risk of making NAME and your wife mad at me, you should both really stop smoking okay.
PATIENT: I will, I'm going to.
DOCTOR: Okay and that's fantastic and it'll really help you but the secondhand smoke is still gonna be a problem to you as well.  If your wife can stop smoking too I know it's tough, it's a big commitment and it's really hard but it you can work on it that'll be [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well if she sees your doctor I think the doctor told them, they're gonna set her up for.
