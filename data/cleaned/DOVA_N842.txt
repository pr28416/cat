PATIENT: Hello DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: How are you?  You've had kind of an eventful [REDACTED] since the last time I saw you.
PATIENT: Good.  So you read my records?
DOCTOR: Of course.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's good, good, I'm doing good.
DOCTOR: You had a little bit of a bleed, sorry that happened.
PATIENT: I'm alright.
DOCTOR: You were not on aspirin were you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: We do not have you on aspirin.  I wanted to make sure that we didn't.  Yeah, you weren't on the aspirin I think.  It was only like six days after I saw you.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Did it just happen like that?
PATIENT: No actually had had happened was that.
DOCTOR: You hit your head?
PATIENT: I was uh playing with my grandson.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And I flipped backwards and I hit my head.
DOCTOR: Got it.
PATIENT: And uh.
DOCTOR: That makes more sense.
PATIENT: So I thought uh, well what the heck, you know I've hit my head many times so what's the difference.  So I went to a primary doctor outside and they gave me some painkillers and I was having some headaches on and off until one day I got out of bed and I couldn't even put my foot in my slipper.  I called here and I gave them all the information.  They tell me if that's the case come right up so when they opened my head, there was a previous.
DOCTOR: It was an old one.
PATIENT: Old one in there but uh they stuck in a drain when I conked my head the headaches stopped.  So I got a drain here and a drain here and.
DOCTOR: What did they think the old one was from?
PATIENT: I have no idea, wouldn't know, you know.
DOCTOR: But they thought they saw some lesions in there.
PATIENT: I don't know, that's a lot of them.  My kids know more because for three or four days I had no idea.
DOCTOR: How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: I feel fine.  I feel fine.  I feel good.  Sometimes I, I don't know when I open my eyes wide open.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I feel like I'm stretching but all in all I feel, I feel good.
DOCTOR: What meds are you on right now?
PATIENT: Medication?  Okay I have simvastatin.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh I take a vitamin [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Vitamin D, I have you on vitamin D.
PATIENT: This one here was prescribed by the hospital here and I did manage to get an order for the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Expired.
PATIENT: It expired.
DOCTOR: So are you taking it?
PATIENT: Well you have to decide uh based on my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Right.  I read the note by the neurosurgeon.
PATIENT: Yeah.  A little bit high there.
DOCTOR: Are you on it now?
PATIENT: No.  I haven't taken it for about maybe a couple of weeks.
DOCTOR: You've been out for two weeks?
PATIENT: Yeah I ran out.
DOCTOR: I see your blood pressure is not that bad.  139/73.
PATIENT: The nurse that comes to see me a couple of times a month.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She says uh my blood pressure is perfect, 120, 123 but it's a little bit hyper sometimes, it depends on you know, I got to tell my wife not to put salt in the food.
DOCTOR: 139/73, given your other medical problems, I'm not necessarily inclined to treat it, to be honest with you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um you have relatively normal kidney functions um, you're not a diabetic.  The last time you were here you were like 157/90.
PATIENT: That was before.
DOCTOR: Right and that is why I wanted to start it.
PATIENT: Everything, everything is sky-rocketing and everything.
DOCTOR: Probably there are probably a lot of reasons for that.
PATIENT: Correct, correct.
DOCTOR: Even if I were to start you on it, I'll do half that dose okay.  I would do the 12.5 not the 25.
PATIENT: Hmm.  I'm taking my blood pressure myself.
DOCTOR: When do you check it at home and what is it?  I'll check it again with this cuff.
PATIENT: Yeah, probably lower.  Uh sometimes like in hyper, you know 130, 120.
DOCTOR: 130.
PATIENT: Yes, 130, 120, 124, sometimes lower.
DOCTOR: How high does it get?
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: Does it ever hit the 140 range?
PATIENT: I think so, I think, not a lot though.
DOCTOR: Once, twice.
PATIENT: Once, twice.
DOCTOR: When?  After activity or?
PATIENT: After activity or after yelling at the kids.
DOCTOR: So pretty normal reasons.
PATIENT: Normal reasons.  But I'm pretty sure it's gonna be lower when you take it now.  I uh, I'll take the medication if I really have to but I'd rather not if I don't.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.
PATIENT: Now the other one, the tamsulosin, I'm not taking that.
DOCTOR: You're not taking the tamsulosin?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You stopped taking the calcium and simvastatin?
PATIENT: Correct.
DOCTOR: Cause tamsulosin makes you dizzy correct right?
PATIENT: Yeah I wasn't feeling too good.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And you've been off of that for how long?
PATIENT: I would say a couple of months.
DOCTOR: Are you still seeing the urologist for the prostate?
PATIENT: Yes.  They took the PSA test the other day; they gave me a blood test.
DOCTOR: 0.35 is what it came back.
PATIENT: So that's good.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: And you're not have, you're not having more urinary tract symptoms?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I do get up two, three times at night.  I hate that.
DOCTOR: Oh you do.
PATIENT: Who wouldn't?
DOCTOR: Who wouldn't I agree.  I didn't know you were getting up at night.
PATIENT: Yeah I did get up.  I feel the pressure you know and I don't have to urinate a lot but, the pressure is there.  It's hard to take a nap in the afternoon to relax me.
DOCTOR: (Doctor working on computer)  Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date but did you get a flu shot this year?
PATIENT: Uh no, I'm gonna wait on that.
DOCTOR: You don't want that then?
PATIENT: Uh no, no.
DOCTOR: Why not?
PATIENT: Well I have mixed reasons.  Every time I take one, I catch a cold.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And with my uh situation I like to know like, play it cool, or easy.  I don't want to, I know of course you know after these, is this gonna be normal for me, is something gonna change?
DOCTOR: What over [REDACTED].
PATIENT: With the whole head issue.
DOCTOR: But that happened a while ago.
PATIENT: It's going on, over 3 1/2 months.
DOCTOR: Right [REDACTED].
PATIENT: So it should be okay.
DOCTOR: It should start cooling down again.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You not a drinker?
PATIENT: Sometimes I do.
DOCTOR: But you're not a smoker if I remember.
PATIENT: No, right, about 35 years ago.
DOCTOR: I'm just keeping track of some of this stuff I uh.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I keep myself busy, I keep myself occupied.
DOCTOR: You've had a ton of lab work recently so.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: All in all you're looking a whole lot better than I expected.  After reading some of these notes, I was a little afraid you know.
PATIENT: Uh my kids uh were told that it was gonna be uh, not drive for about six months, I'm gonna have to use the walker.
DOCTOR: You're walking fine.  You don’t have any neurologic deficits at all?
PATIENT: No, no, not at all.  That's why I don't think I need the.
DOCTOR: Gotcha.
PATIENT: The nurse that comes in, takes my pressure once every other week.
DOCTOR: It's been a while, the thiazide dropped your us….  When did you start taking the thiazide, back in August, the hydrochlorothiazide?
PATIENT: Maybe.
DOCTOR: In September.
PATIENT: You mean for the.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh, that's uh that's here.
DOCTOR: Right but that was in September.
PATIENT: In late September.
DOCTOR: Yeah it dropped your sodium a little bit.
PATIENT: My potassium was off, the sodium was off.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Blood pressure was.
DOCTOR: Let's not restart it unless we absolutely have to now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That’s my suggestion.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: You know we should do another cholesterol, I mean you might be due.  So you've been on the simvastatin for a long time?
PATIENT: Yes, yes.
DOCTOR: Have you been on the same dose?
PATIENT: Yes, yes sir.
DOCTOR: Half a pill, long-term?
PATIENT: I would say six months, not long.
DOCTOR: Have they ever increased it?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  I'm gonna put you on 40 once a day; just take the full 40 once a day.
PATIENT: Okay.  The simvastatin?
DOCTOR: Yeah instead of half a tab, just take the one tab.
PATIENT: Take the one tab.
DOCTOR: Yeah, alright.  It probably needs to change, really not change much.
PATIENT: Without even checking my blood?
DOCTOR: Well they've looked at it back in August.
PATIENT: Oh I see, okay.  So you see in the past.
DOCTOR: It's a little higher than I probably want it.
PATIENT: But everything was off at that time, everything.
DOCTOR: Yeah but do you know the cholesterol, it's usually not gonna affect the cholesterol; however, having high cholesterol puts you at risk for strokes.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It's a different type of stroke.  If you’re avid to not do it, you can hold off and then recheck eventually, I'm okay with that.
PATIENT: Well it's up to you.
DOCTOR: No, we work together here, we're a team.
PATIENT: I can have another blood test done, either here or outside and uh we'll uh.
DOCTOR: Cause you know what, although we don't treat total, we generally treat the number called the LDL.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You're total is, I'd like it under 200 and it's 205.  The LDL you know [REDACTED] and you do have hypertension and you've had a history of stroke I would theoretically like it [REDACTED] under 100.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay?
PATIENT: You the man, you're the doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we will go, let's go up to 40.
PATIENT: Take the whole thing?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I think, it's not, you're not gonna feel any different.  It's not, if you're feeling, if we checked it and its a little lower, then I think we can just track that down.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But having a little bit too low of cholesterol with medication is not a bad thing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay?
PATIENT: So, yeah I do have another bottle, full bottle at home.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll change it, they might send you more but you can always tell them not to.
PATIENT: Well you know by taking in half, you know it lasts quite a long time.
DOCTOR: So we'll put that in for you today.  You never made it to Greece then.
PATIENT: No (laughter).
DOCTOR: I'm really sorry about that.  That's a shame.
PATIENT: Alright, there's no way.
DOCTOR: I was reading here in my notes.  I read it before I came in, return in three montha after patient returns from Greece.
PATIENT: Greece yeah and in a way I'm glad I didn't because if I would, if I would have got on the airplane, I probably would have died.
DOCTOR: You might have, I think so, you head your head though, would you have hit your head?
PATIENT: What do you mean?
DOCTOR: Well you said you hit your hit your head a couple of days before you had the symptoms.
PATIENT: No that was about maybe a couple of months.
DOCTOR: Oh months ago you hit your head.
PATIENT: A couple of months before I came here.
DOCTOR: Oh so slow.
PATIENT: Slowly things [REDACTED].  I heard the bump.
DOCTOR: Subdurals are like that.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah and sometimes at night when I'd be watching TV, I couldn't hold my head someplace normal.  I didn’t know what was going on.
DOCTOR: You never told me that at the visit that you were feeling dizzy.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Did you?
PATIENT: I don’t think so.  I wasn't really feeling dizzy.  I was feeling uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uncomfortable and I thought it was probably my neck.  I thought it was my neck and I would put heating pads on my neck and I would uh move my head this way and that away and go to bed early.  Like I said until one day I got up and I couldn't put my foot in the slipper.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: Anyway.
DOCTOR: Good for you that everything.
PATIENT: It worked out okay.
DOCTOR: It worked out okay.
PATIENT: I uh, I'm thankful the people here, I'm glad I came here because I figured if I would've went outside, by the time those people find out how to get their money or who to contact for my records.
DOCTOR: I want get a set of labs first, do you mind?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: The hemoglobin was a little low and generally everything is coming back normal.  I'll recheck your cholesterol too.  You have to be fasting but that's okay.
PATIENT: That's okay.
DOCTOR: Its okay, it's not gonna give me the best information but it'll give me some information.
PATIENT: Alright.  So I should take the blood test then.
DOCTOR: Yeah we'll get some blood [REDACTED].  Um, alright hop up over here.  Since we're done with the chatting, just the exam alright.
PATIENT: Okay, should I take anything off?

DOCTOR: Shame on me.  [REDACTED] anything.
PATIENT: (Laughter).
DOCTOR: Not the devices problem, it's my problem.  I don't like the automated machines they use out there.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Cause sometimes it doesn't give you accurate numbers.  A little bit higher.
PATIENT: What?  What'd you find?
DOCTOR: I got like 143/85.
