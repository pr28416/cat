DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: You ready for me now?  How you doing today doc?
DOCTOR: I'm fine, how you doing?
PATIENT: I'm alive (laughter).
DOCTOR: How's a, Thanksgiving good?
PATIENT: Oh it was great, it was great.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It wasn't too good was it?
PATIENT: It was great.
DOCTOR: It was great.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Now what are you gonna do about me going to the bathroom so much?
DOCTOR: Yeah, did you start that medication?
PATIENT: What medication?
DOCTOR: Oh we were gonna talk about trying a medication.  I see, we're gonna try some medication.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You know it's a good thing because your blood pressure's high.  This medication actually lowers blood pressure so you know.  Uh, so you haven't been on anything like that before uh, so let's see hold on a sec.
PATIENT: I got a list of my medicines at the base, it look like an awful lot of medicine I'm on.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately you do need them.
PATIENT: I got a notice also that I only got two refills on some of them too see.
DOCTOR: Yeah I can refill all this stuff.  Ah here we go, let's start with the peeing problems.  What's the, uh how many times a day are you going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Quite a few.  I can't even remember.
DOCTOR: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9?
PATIENT: Somewhere in that neighborhood.
DOCTOR: So it's raised.
PATIENT: Well, like today for instance, I think I've been about six or seven times already.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know and the day's only got started cause, I got till about 9 or 10 o'clock tonight.
DOCTOR: You maybe go 10 times a day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Got it.
PATIENT: Plus.
DOCTOR: So how many times in the night do you wake up to go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Anywhere from 3-4 times a night.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Three to five times a night really.
DOCTOR: Okay and uh, this didn't come about all of a sudden; it's been kind of gradual?
PATIENT: Well, most of the time it comes out right away you know.
DOCTOR: I mean, I mean, this problem itself.  It's been coming on for a while or?
PATIENT: I believe it has.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: Every time I come to see you I actually forget.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Until I get back in the cold and then I think about it when I go to the bathroom, I supposed to tell him about that.
DOCTOR: Do you ever feel like your, your stream is a little bit weaker than usual?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Ah and do you ever feel like you don't get everything out, like you could go to the bathroom again like an hour later sometimes sooner?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright um and then um, any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Discharge or irritation, nothing.  Alright.  Well it sounds like you have an enlarged prostate um and uh basically what we can do for that, so basically your prostate is kind of, looks like this and its uh with time everybody's prostate gets a little bit larger.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um as you age you kind of, if grows larger and larger and at some point it can cause a little bit of obstruction of your urine stream uh because [REDACTED] you know your urethra and all that stuff so, so it can actually cause you to have urinary retention so you know.  So basically your just not emptying your bladder all the way out so, you're going to the bathroom more frequently.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: And with these water pills, when I take these water pills, 30 minutes later I have to go to the bathroom and I go every ten minutes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: For some reason, for about oh, that'll last about hour and a half to two and a half hours.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Then you said this even happens when you're not taking the water pill.
PATIENT: Exactly.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so I mean a lot of pills themselves, they will make you urinate uh but only for the six hours once you take it.   With you on the furosemide, that one only acts for like six hours long so, so, you know, you might be more urination you know right after you take the pill if it was just due to that but it's still happening even beyond that.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Definitely is.
DOCTOR: Um, alright.  So we can start you on medication.
PATIENT: Well when will I get this medication?
DOCTOR: Right here, you can pick it up today if you want.  I'll order it right now.
PATIENT: Order it right now so that it'll be ready so when I get downstairs.
DOCTOR: Oh I can do that.  I'll tell them to get to go quick, uh.
PATIENT: Do I need to take this at night or morning?
DOCTOR: Uh so you can take it at bedtime.  Cause it can make you, it can cause you to have a little bit of dizziness sometimes, especially like when you're standing up, so I would take it at bedtime, probably be the best time to take it.  Um the way that they do do it um, they kind of titrate it up.  They have a starter pack, which is just like comes just like I don't know 1 mg, 2 mg and 5 mg pills or something.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And there'll be instructions on the starter pack that you states you can't run backwards, you might take 1 mg for a week then 2 mg for another week and then take the 5 and at the end of that month um [REDACTED] if you have any problems with the medication just call and leave us a message um and I'll, uh you know we can try other medications.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Usually people are fine with it but sometimes it does give people problems.
PATIENT: Alright good enough.
DOCTOR: Alright so and then we'll see what we want to do after that.  We'll probably put you on the 5 mg dose after you're on the starter pack okay.  I'll order that for you to pick up now, I'll write this down alright.  Anything you're running out of right now that you want something filled?
PATIENT: No not that I can think of.  Well I got the list right here; it tells you how many refills I got left on it and everything.  They just gave me this one a few minutes ago.  Two refills, and on this one I got nine refills and um I got one refill on this, you can take a look at that.
DOCTOR: I got it here too?
PATIENT: Oh you do?
DOCTOR: I didn't know if you want me to tell them to give you a prescription right now, I could just write you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Two refills, two refills, one, one, one.
DOCTOR: How about, okay so that's the prostate um and then I should do a prostate exam on you too, unless you have a serious objection to that.
PATIENT: What you got to do first of all.
DOCTOR: Put a finger in.
PATIENT: Up my butt?
DOCTOR: Your butt yep.
PATIENT: Yeah I do have a serious [objection](laughter), you want me to be honest.
DOCTOR: If you don't want to do it that's okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, I do have a serious.
DOCTOR: Thatâ€™s okay.
PATIENT: I always.
DOCTOR: We can just start the medication and see [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I always think that something should come out of there and not go in there (laughter).
DOCTOR: Alright that's fine.
PATIENT: I appreciate that you know.  Maybe the next time if it don't work, this don't work then I'll, I'll be, you want that, I'll say hey doctor whatever you thinks.
DOCTOR: Alright and then uh, here's your hemoglobin A1c levels alright so 8.1% is the most recent one uh.  This one we did back last year, it was a little bit better, it was down to 7.1% at one point then it started going up and I think I talked to you about that, if you tried to improve the diet a little bit.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It's a little bit better than 8.1%.  Still not where we want it though.  We want it below 7% really.
PATIENT: Want it below 7?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So this isn't absolutely horrible but it's higher than we'd like.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh and the rest of your blood work, let's see here, cholesterol you're cholesterol is not so good.
PATIENT: You know you took me off the cholesterol pills.
DOCTOR: Oh because you had the, the problem with the muscle pain.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Did the muscle pains ever get better or no?
PATIENT: Well I, I don't have much of uh cramps and stuff.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] and I don't cramp up as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean I still cramp but nothing like I was cause it look like every day I could be laying in the bed and I could move a certain way and I get a cramp in my leg.  I'd be getting out the bed or something and get a cramp someplace you know and it was awful.  Then some of them cramps they last for two or three days, some of them, especially.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I got figure out what I want to do with your cholesterol med.
PATIENT: I still got those cholesterol, cause I got some of those.
DOCTOR: Yeah cause I'd like you to be on the cholesterol pill and I don't think, I don't think that's giving you the problem with the cramping though.  It can do that but I don't think it was doing it.  What do you feel?
PATIENT: Well and since I've been off of them, I don't, like I said I don't cramp as much.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I don't cramp as much.  I mean I used to, I could really, I told my wife I just move, look I could be sleeping, turn over and get the cramp, I say oh my God.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'd have to get out the bed and stand on the side of the bed for hours.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  And does anybody um, anybody in your family ever have any weird muscle problems or anything like that that you know of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um.  Do you get any morning sickness like, with your muscles and joints, do you feel, do you feel like that's really an issue or not really?
PATIENT: It's not an issue.  I don't think it's an issue you know.
DOCTOR: And um and when you don't have those cramps do you have problems with pains in your muscles really.
PATIENT: Well my muscles get tight a lot now because lately I've been doing a lot of exercise so.
DOCTOR: Uh what kind, what do you do?
PATIENT: I do, like this you know, trying to bring the stomach here, some crunches and I.
DOCTOR: Do you lift weights?
PATIENT: And I, no, no don't lift any weights.
DOCTOR: Alright and you don't have problems like combing your hair or doing . . .
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No, nothing like that alright.  Sometimes we can try like uh, some cholesterol medication that's not as strong to, that's the other alternative uh.  I think we'll, I think first we'll just deal with this prostate and your blood sugar.  So what do you, are you checking your blood sugars?  You're supposed to bring your log because you know the thing is your blood sugars, they're not, it's not even difficult to really control.  All you really need to do, you're already on insulin I just gotta figure out how much to increase your insulin so that can be controlled, that's the thing.
PATIENT: Well see I'm trying to exercise and diet, where I can come off the insulin some you know, so it can be decreased so that's what I'm hoping.
DOCTOR: Uh we'll see.  So what, well how much insulin are you taking right now?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm taking 20 in the morning and 15 at night.
DOCTOR: 20 in the morning, 15 at night okay and when was the last time you checked the blood sugars?
PATIENT: Oh it's been about a month and a half now.
DOCTOR: Really, wow.  And you never feel like your blood sugar is low or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh sometime I get a headache or something but I, I chalk that up to not eating and stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Does your wife know you don't check your blood sugar?
PATIENT: Don't tell her either (laughter).
DOCTOR: Can you get her to check your blood sugar?
PATIENT: (Laughter).
DOCTOR: I'm serious.
PATIENT: Uh I'm gonna start doing it.  I'll start doing it myself you know.
DOCTOR: Cause I can tell you right now, you'll, you'll never be off of insulin.  You're taking 30,000 units of insulin a day, that's a pretty substantial amount.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: And it's not, it's really, in terms of your health it makes no difference if you're taking 30 units or 40 units, you might in the [REDACTED] that it's controlling your blood sugars, that's the thing is chloride so.  I mean we have patients that are on almost 200 units of insulin.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: You're not going to have that, but it does.
PATIENT: I hope not.
DOCTOR: Doesn't really matter how much insulin you're on, the key is that your blood sugars are under control.  Insulin's just a normal substance produced by your pancreas.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So it's not like we're giving you anything abnormal.  It's just, when you have diabetes you know, the insulin, you have problems making it when your pancreas, and all and your cells have problems using the insulin and you usually require more insulin as a diabetic.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So, when you don't know what it is um.
PATIENT: Can't you.
DOCTOR: What I can do.
PATIENT: Now, well I got a question.
DOCTOR: Yep, uh-huh.
PATIENT: Um, um, DOCTOR, oh what was her name, DOCTOR, she used to work here.
DOCTOR: Yes she was in Endocrinology.
PATIENT: Anyway, she was my doctor before.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: At one time and she would send me to the Lab and she could tell me what my blood sugar was really fast.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's what a hemoglobin A1c.
PATIENT: That's what I thought it was you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's.
PATIENT: It's coming down.
DOCTOR: It's not a substitute for checking your blood sugars.
PATIENT: It's, its coming down but that's.
DOCTOR: So your hemoglobin A1c is 8.1%, so that means.
PATIENT: It was 8.5 though.
DOCTOR: So what that means is your blood sugars on average are running about 205, 210.  That's what your blood sugars are running if you would actually check it, you're probably gonna get somewhere in the high 100s, low 200.
PATIENT: I got, what time would you like for me to check it approximately?
DOCTOR: So I would uh check it before breakfast, before you eat anything.
PATIENT: Before I eat anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  And then I would start with that, at least we'll the basic, what you need to do.
PATIENT: Okay, okay, I'll check it.
DOCTOR: You don't even have to do it every single day.  If you did it like once or twice a week I would be happy with that.
PATIENT: You got it.
DOCTOR: But, what I do what you to do is increase your insulin to 20 units in the morning and 20 units at night.
PATIENT: 20 and 20?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: That means I'm they're gonna to send me more insulin.
DOCTOR: That's fine I can change it okay?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright.  And your blood sugars will get better cause again the amount of insulin you're still doesn't really matter, how high your blood sugars are that's what's the matter and you don't know how high they are if you're not checking them.  That's really the key.
PATIENT: Alright and I know you've told me to do it a couple of times and I.
DOCTOR: I did.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Alright you got me.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Anything I need that I'm not doing that I should be doing?
DOCTOR: Uh that's, really those are the main things alright.  I mean that's the thing that is going to save your life in the long run.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Save your feet from getting amputated and you know losing vision in your eyes, save you from having, or you have some pains in your legs but you know if you get a little bit better.
PATIENT: Neuropathy is a problem.
DOCTOR: Neuropathy and all that stuff gets better with better blood control, blood sugar control.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So work on that uh.  Let's get you up here.  Let have you step forward.
PATIENT: (Laughter)  Alright, what's up, where your mitts?
DOCTOR: Lungs sound good.  Deep breath.  Let's hear that again.  And how old are you now?
PATIENT: 63.
DOCTOR: 63 alright.  [REDACTED].  Uh how's the smoking going?
PATIENT: Smoking?
DOCTOR: No, you don't smoke okay.  That's cool.
PATIENT: (Laughter).  I did smoke a cigar though.
DOCTOR: Oh every once in a while.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: (Laughter).  I quit smoking when they went up to a dollar.
DOCTOR: Good, when was that?
PATIENT: I don't even remember it's been so long ago.  They tell me cigarettes $8 a pack now.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Should be motivation for anybody right?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I told my wife you need to quit smoking.
DOCTOR: Right.  Hey good news is your blood pressure is pretty good, better than it was when we checked it, 124/62, good.
PATIENT: I know my blood pressure shouldn't be that bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED] you're walking around, you know what's going on but.  I like that number.
PATIENT: I do too.  Yeah I told her when we move into the new house, no smoking within 45 feet of the house.
DOCTOR: That's right, that's what you need, you gotta lay down the law.
PATIENT: And there's no smoking in my car or my truck.
DOCTOR: That ain't bad, that's exactly what you gotta do, you know to be.  You know when they started, I think that's actually been pretty helpful is, as much as people hate the smoking ban and stuff and you know and this must be kind of, sometimes it's the government overstepping their bounds.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So you know, I think it's a real good thing.
PATIENT: In the long run.  No I don't have any swelling, no swelling.
DOCTOR: Even if, even if you did smoke, I think it's a good thing.
PATIENT: I check my feet every day, I don't have any swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  Let me see what we have here in detail.  And your muscles hurt right now?
PATIENT: No, they're pretty good right now, no.  I haven't did anything I guess.
DOCTOR: And any recent sickness or colds or anything like that?
PATIENT: No thank God and I hope I don't get any.
DOCTOR: Alright.  I'll be right back okay?
PATIENT: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT: 31:13  DOCTOR IN:  35:39)
DOCTOR: Alright.  Now we'll, I'll just have them make all those changes where's that medication list you had?
PATIENT: Oh right here.
DOCTOR: I'll just it on this so you remember and the other thing, you know I don't know why you had those cramping things and you know you're muscle enzyme levels are just a little bit elevated.  Again I don't know why, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you to the rheumatologist to see you, to see if they have any other ideas of why that might be because we took you off of the cholesterol pill.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh thinking that that might be causing the problem.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But the last blood test you had, your muscle enzyme level still is a little bit elevated so.  Again I don't know why that is.  I mean it doesn't sound like anything else is going on cause you're pretty healthy you know.
PATIENT: I.
DOCTOR: You can get some weird diseases that make you weak, but you know, you're pretty young and strong so.  At least you look young and strong right?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, looks are deceiving someone.
DOCTOR: (Laughter).  Um, you know all the kind of [REDACTED].  Twice a day, 20 units, 20 units in the morning, 20 units, what time do you take it at night, before dinner?
PATIENT: It varies.
DOCTOR: That's when you should take it.
PATIENT: It varies.
DOCTOR: Okay just take it before dinner.
PATIENT: Alright.  Maybe that's what I'm not doing.  I'm not taking it at the right time you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Uh I'll see you back in three months.  We'll repeat your labs at that time.  This is December.
PATIENT: 8th, its December the 8th now.
DOCTOR: We'll check your labs in a month, how about that?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: A month for your labs.  We can see with you checking your blood sugars and increasing that insulin if that brings down your hemoglobin A1c. okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then the Rheumatology, they'll call you and schedule an appointment at some point and then uh.
PATIENT: It'll be soon though, probably this month.
DOCTOR: Uh it might be, it might be, I don't know since the holidays coming up it might be like after the New Year.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright?
PATIENT: Alright doc.  Did I tell you, you have a Merry Christmas.
DOCTOR: You too Happy Holidays.
PATIENT: You got a minute.
PATIENT: 38:15
Time is 4:10.
