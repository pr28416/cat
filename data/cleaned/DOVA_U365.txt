DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh she was using an iodine soak you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And so I started using it, and thought maybe that would help it.  Iodine.

DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If that doesn't work I’ll have you see podiatry.

DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No [REDACTED].  It gets real noticeable when I itch it and once in a while, and when it gets hot out gets really noticeable and then it spreads out [REDACTED] and uh to my crotch uh, cool weather like this and if I keep myself powdered.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's usually okay but um, I mean I'd never had it until I was in Vietnam.  I came back and when I came back from Vietnam I mean while I was there I got it.

DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Like down here.
PATIENT: It gets real pronounced.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It gets real pronounced and if I sweat a lot then it gets tender and it moves you know.
DOCTOR: Well I think that's a lot of skin irritation from sweat, like sweating.  If it's in the arm pits and the groins, you actually do sweat there [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I mean cause I never had it until then it came.

DOCTOR: And they never tell you that, right?
PATIENT: Should I put my shirt on?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so you know, honestly.
PATIENT: You don't know.
DOCTOR: I mean what I would recommend right now is you continue keeping yourself you know use deodorant, dry uh and then but it's just, it's not something like [REDACTED] from now.  I could have you see the dermatologist I just don't know if there’s an actual treatment for it it, other than just keeping this up with good hygiene.
PATIENT: Well, when my.  Here's the hook.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh, I get more of it.

PATIENT: All these years?
DOCTOR: Yeah, possibly, we'll see.
PATIENT: I mean the VA doctors, like I said, disregarded it.
DOCTOR: No we'll check it out.
PATIENT: And then uh and then my regular doctors uh said well the one doctor said he thought it was ring worm and I says it's not ring worm and then he looked at it closer and he says no you're right it's not, it's some kind of fungus or rather some kind of rash and then uh my doctor that I had most recently said you know, he told me to come to the VA but I think I'm you know, I was turned down by you guys, I'm not going to come here again you know.  At that time, I wasn't signed up you know.
DOCTOR: No no problem.
PATIENT: I didn't want to bother you guys with that kind of you know uh thing since it was turned down but geez I you know.  Now that I'm in it, I figured well maybe you should take a look at it because it.
