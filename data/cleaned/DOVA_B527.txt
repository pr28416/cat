DOCTOR: Whatever happened with the colonoscopy and the biopsies they did?  Did they ever call you back?

PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay does it ever bother you?
PATIENT: No, just from my hay fever you know.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Kind of looks like something we call rosacea, it's not really serious but.  What happened here?
PATIENT: What this scar?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Oh that was way back in the 70s, I had an operation done in Oklahoma when I was kid to take a cyst out.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: And then I got on a fight on the school bus, somebody busted the stitches open.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: When they went back in and tried to repair it and then the tornado hit in Oklahoma at that time, back in the 60s and I never went back to them.
DOCTOR: Oh.  Lay back for me.  No problems with that ever?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  You said you're eating fine.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay you can sit up.  Any weight loss at home?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Bowel movements are okay?
PATIENT: Yeah so far.
DOCTOR: No more dark ones.  I saw that you were in the ER a month or two ago and thought you had dark bowel movements.
PATIENT: Yeah that was because of my iron I think it was.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah and I was taking multiple vitamins and every thing’s fine.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You still taking the iron?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you out of it?  You're not taking it because you are out of it?
PATIENT: Oh no.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No I might have just [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I quit taking it.  I'm taking a multivitamin.
DOCTOR: Which is not as strong.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Which worked just as well so I was hoping to get my blood, my iron level and see how my iron is doing and my cholesterol.
DOCTOR: Well your blood counts are great.  They're normal. They did those when you were here in February.
PATIENT: Okay well that's good.
DOCTOR: Um.  We need to check your cholesterol today.  I'm going to check your thyroid levels.  Uh and you haven't taken the Synthroid since when?
PATIENT: Uh February.
DOCTOR: Okay you haven't taken anything since February?
PATIENT: No just aspirin.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think I might have taken little purple pills but I take them for a blood pressure.
DOCTOR: What's that?
PATIENT: It's the purple pills, I don't know what their called but they're tablets.  They're for night.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I take those.  I still got a couple left.
DOCTOR: And you said you're walking okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, fine.  I don't walk really that far far, I do my little stroll.
DOCTOR: You walk up stairs without a problem?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Any more urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: No, so far.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And I know you were having a problem with that.
PATIENT: Yeah I don't know what, all of a sudden it just comes up like that and then I take the antibiotic and I'm fine.
DOCTOR: Where do you live sir?
PATIENT: I live in Oak Forest.
DOCTOR: Oak Forest.
PATIENT: Yeah down south.  About an hour away from here.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm assuming you've eaten today right?
PATIENT: Yeah I had some Egg McMuffins earlier [REDACTED].  Yeah I had McDonalds earlier.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: About 10 o'clock or so.
DOCTOR: That's probably going to skew your cholesterol levels uh, especially McDonalds it's got a lot of cholesterol in it.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Uh maybe can you come back some time this week or next week and get the blood draws done in the morning before you eat?
PATIENT: Well I like to give that in Oak Lawn.  Cause it takes me at least an hour to get up here.
DOCTOR: Does it really?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Is there a VA in Oak Lawn?
PATIENT: Yeah I can get that outpatient patient there over on 95th Street.
DOCTOR: Yeah if they can do it there.  Is it through Hines?
PATIENT: Yeah.  They can draw blood there.
DOCTOR: Okay that's fine then.  Yeah if I put the order in here then they should be able to get it.
PATIENT: They should get it there and I can get.
DOCTOR: All I want to check is just your cholesterol levels and your thyroid, make sure your thyroid is doing okay because you haven't taken the thyroid pill since February.  Okay, otherwise are you feeling good?
PATIENT: Yeah I'm feeling alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me be right back.
PATIENT: Yeah I can't any more time off of work right now.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah go to Oak Lawn [REDACTED] that's fine.
PATIENT: Yeah if I can get in, I just call them and you know they usually draw my blood.
DOCTOR: Where you working, remind me?
PATIENT: Oh BBC Passengers over there in Alsip.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].  Stay tuned and I'll be right back with you.
PATIENT: Oh okay alright.
DOCTOR: I'll drop this off while I'm out.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  105.0  DOCTOR IN:  109:40)
DOCTOR: Uh so I want to check your blood today before um we start any, specifically the Synthroid, um the thyroid medication.  Just to see how your thyroid level is doing.  Um we'll check that.  It should be back to me by the end of the week and I can give you a call and tell you if you need to restart it or not.  Um we should restart probably all the other stuff, at least the cholesterol medications um.  Do you check your blood pressures at home?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  Can you get a blood pressure medication and check it at home?
PATIENT: Uh they just took my blood pressure and it was 138/75.
DOCTOR: Yeah it was good, 138/72 um which is good.  What I'm wondering is that's pretty good but your blood pressure can change.  Uh you're on some blood pressure medications at home.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: And I'm wondering if we need to keep you on them or not.  That's why it's important you know it's important to get you here every couple of months so we can check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I don't want to have you on blood pressure medications that you don't need.  At the same time I don't want to stop the blood pressure medications cause your blood pressure looks good today and then find out that you normally run 165 at home or something like that.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: So I think it would be best, it'd be best for you, to be honest, if you got a blood pressure cuff and was checking your blood pressure regularly at home.  For the sole reason that if you don't need to be on medication that you're taking, one less medication you have to take.  That's one less hassle you have to deal with.
PATIENT: Yeah I don't have one of those machines.
DOCTOR: So you can get them um at Walgreen’s.
PATIENT: Walgreen’s right.
DOCTOR: Walgreen’s or CVS and they cost from what I hear generally $20-$25 for one that works fine.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: If you don't want to buy one you can go into any CVS and they have them that you can check your blood pressure there but that means you have to be going to the CVS all the time.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Um but uh from what people that have got them have told me they cost about $20-$25.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um the other thing uh is it an issue getting here um, being from Oak Lawn.  Is that why you don't come often?
PATIENT: No Oak Forest.
DOCTOR: Oak Forest.
PATIENT: Yeah I mean it takes me at least an hour, especially at this time, there's rush hour.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  No I understand.  The thing is with the stuff you're on, with the medications you're on and the medical issues you have we'd really like to be seeing you every three months or so.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um if that's not possible uh we need you to get up here every three months, uh there is the Oak Lawn Clinic.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: I just asked my attending about it and he said that if you get the number for them, I can't get you an appointment there or anything but um they can give you the number.  I'm not saying, we'd love to still treat you here, you know I'd love to have you come here every three months.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But if that's not possible I'd much rather have you seen every three months than once every 15 months and your medications run out and you're not taking your medications for three months and.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You know we're coming in and we're trying to chase our tail with everything else.  If it's going to be easier for you to get into that clinic um, for your own good I think its better that.
PATIENT: Yeah it only takes me about 15-20 minutes to get there.  I'm usually in and out of there anyway.
DOCTOR: But it's up to you.  Like I say.
PATIENT: I got the numbers at home.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I got them in my.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'd keep all your appointments here until you make an appointment there cause like I said we can't make an appointment there.
PATIENT: I know they got doctors here, you know they could schedule me or whatever and I could get that to work and they'd put that in my files so you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  But you really should be seeing someone every three months or so.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Cause you're on, as you know you're on a bunch of medications.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: And we need to make sure we have you on the right doses that we don't have you on too much medication or too little.  Um seeing you every 15 months it's only going to hurt you.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Um and while we'd love to keep you here, I'd much rather you actually see someone regularly.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So it may be an option for you.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um but if you don't mind we'll check the labs today and I'll give you a call later in the week and let you know uh about the Synthroid.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: I'll put through for the other medications okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.  So I got to go back down and get the blood tests?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Yeah sorry.
PATIENT: That's alright, that's what happens I guess.
DOCTOR: Um yeah just get it done today because you said you can't make it later in the week right?
PATIENT: No it's just too hard.  I mean I'm taking off of work now but that's cause I got your appointment.
DOCTOR: When do you work, what shift do you work?
PATIENT: I work the day shift.
DOCTOR: Day shift.
PATIENT: I work from 7 to 3.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: 7 to 3:30 yeah.
DOCTOR: If you can make it to the Oak Lawn Clinic this week sometime that would be fine too but I want to know whether we need to restart your thyroid medication and I'd like to let you know this week.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So it's up to you.
PATIENT: I can stop there afterwards because I've already eaten.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  Yeah if you can get it done today that's fine too.
PATIENT: As long as they can do it now, I'll go downstairs and they're quick.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any other questions or anything?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  As far as the reflux that you're saying you're having.  I think if you get restarted on the omeprazole that'll help.  That's why we had you on it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: For the reflux.  So probably stopping that is what made the reflux get worse.
PATIENT: Huh it just happens you know what I mean.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Just thought it was because of the food I was eating.
DOCTOR: Yeah and there are things that make it worse and I'm sure you get told this, you know anything spicy.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.  I knew that or coffee.  I always do coffee in the morning.
DOCTOR: Coffee, alcohol.
PATIENT: Oh if I do that.
DOCTOR: Smoking makes it worse.
PATIENT: Oh I don't smoke anymore.
DOCTOR: So those are just things to watch out for.
PATIENT: Right but I try to take it easy you know.  I just take some Tums or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah don't take too many though.
PATIENT: No, hopefully.
DOCTOR: You can actually run into a problem eating too many of those.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Good seeing you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll give you a call.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You give them to them when you sign out, they'll make an appointment for you.  Keep the appointments until; if you're going to switch to the Oak Park Clinic keep these until you actually get an appointment there.  There's sometimes a waiting list so you can keep seeing us until they get you in.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  Thank you now.
DOCTOR: Okay and I'll give you a call at the end of the week.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll see you again.
PATIENT: Alright.
