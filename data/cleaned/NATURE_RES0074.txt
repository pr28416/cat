PATIENT: Yeah, I was just wondering, I don't know the results of the contact that I had, uh, so should I also get tested today?
DOCTOR: Yeah, certainly with nonspecific symptoms such as what you've been experiencing, we will do a test for covid today. However, we will do some lab investigations as well, because it could be something else, so we'll wait for some of those results to come back, and it's great that you've already taken the initiative to isolate from family members and whatnot. And so I ask you to continue doing so, and we will get back to you when the results are in.
PATIENT: OK, yeah, that sounds good, thank you so much.
