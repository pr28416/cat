DOCTOR: Okay, that's fine.  Alright, so how are you been doing since the last time I saw you?
PATIENT: Okay.  I'm doing fine.  I'm about to have surgery.
DOCTOR: Yeah I saw you, you saw a lot of doctors since the last time I saw you.
PATIENT: You got that so.  I'm need you to set all that in motion.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What do you mean?
PATIENT: Uh I have to get my primary care doctor to go take an [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay for the, for the neurosurgeons?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: So whatever's the tests but they wanted me to have this before the surgery, presurgery stuff that they.  I mean they got to do that part but they wanted me to have, it's usually on here whatever they wanted me to do but I.
DOCTOR: Are they at Hines where you saw them?
PATIENT: Right exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay so that's not gonna be in here necessarily.  Let me see if I could uh.
PATIENT: There's something you had to do I forgot what.
DOCTOR: Did they want a Cardiology?
PATIENT: Right, there you go.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Unfortunately I have to send you to another doctor for that.
PATIENT: You have to send me to another doctor for that?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  It's just that well this is the Primary Care Clinic right.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So your Cardiology Clinic does things with the cardiologists unfortunately.  Is there a particular reason they wanted it?
SECOND PERSON E413
He had a heart attack.
DOCTOR: He had a heart attack.
PATIENT: Right around Christmas.
SECOND PERSON E413
December 23rd.
PATIENT: I didn't come to this hospital I had you know I went to uh.
SECOND PERSON E413
To Christ's.
DOCTOR: Oh you were at the Christ okay.  Did they put any stent in?
PATIENT: No stents they gave me a thing where they go into your groin [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh a cardiac cath.
PATIENT: They did that, found no blockage, none of that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Why did they think you had a heart attack then?
PATIENT: They didn't say.  I probably was stressed out [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'd seen the doctors the day before that and they gave me all this stuff about this leg, that's what started all this in motion.
DOCTOR: Gotcha, gotcha, okay.  So you had a car, so that cath was in December right?
PATIENT: That was yeah, December probably 22nd.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I got out of the hospital on Christmas.
DOCTOR: Okay and so the reason they did the cath was because you were having chest pain?
PATIENT: Right, real bad chest pain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they said I had an abnormal test.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And there was no blood tests they couldn't do it, it hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And your cath was normal.
PATIENT: Right.  All that was normal, they said no damage to the heart, nothing was abnormal.
DOCTOR: So what it sounds like to me, it sounds like you didn't actually have a heart attack.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um sounds like you could have, that's the reason they did it is because they were concerned that you did.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But they didn't find any evidence that you had a heart attack.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You didn't have any heart blockages.  It could have just been chest pain from something else.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um also that's hard to say because [REDACTED].
PATIENT: They didn’t say that.
DOCTOR: Yeah exactly.  Um none the less I understand why the surgeons would kind of hesitant.
PATIENT: Okay.  I didn't tell him that.
DOCTOR: Why you didn't tell then, I don't know where.
PATIENT: I didn't tell him about the heart thing, DOCTOR.  I didn't even tell him that.  I don't know where he knew anything about it.
DOCTOR: Let me see.
PATIENT: Oh it might be in the [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON E413
In their notes.  Yeah it's in there.
PATIENT: Yeah I told them.  I told the EMG they were in there.
DOCTOR: Okay so you just, I see it.  Yeah they didn't say they wanted a Cardiology clearance.  They just said preop medical clearance.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah so since you had, actually you don't need to see your cardiologist necessarily because since you had that test that's the ultimate definite test for you know your heart disease.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And you had it and it was normal so.
PATIENT: Sent me home and I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I think that's fine.  Um we're okay with that let's just make sure all your other medicines are well optimized here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure looks good.  Your heart rate looks good.  Are you taking all of your medicines?
PATIENT: Except the gem something.
DOCTOR: Gemfibrozil?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Why is that?
PATIENT: Uh yeah I think this is for cholesterol right?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I got real scared of cholesterol medicines since I had that.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] before.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And if somebody said cholesterol medicine I, that was the worst feeling, I was having those cramps.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] that day.
DOCTOR: I understand. This medicine, this is why, cause I knew about it that's why I started you on a different type of medicine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Totally different class.  It doesn't have the side effect.  Sometimes the only side effects you really have is kind of a weird taste.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um some people get a little bit of a stomach upset.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But you don't, you don't get those side effects like you got from the statin drugs like the Lipitor, things like that.
PATIENT: Right the cramps.
DOCTOR: Yeah you don't get those kinds of side effects.
PATIENT: Okay well I'll take it.
DOCTOR: But you haven't taken it at all huh?
PATIENT: I wasn't no.
DOCTOR: You don't okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  I tell you that, that's the worst feeling I've ever had in my life.
DOCTOR: Yeah I get that, I understand okay.
PATIENT: But I will start that so, if you say that.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's why I hope I mean I probably didn't explain it to you as well last time.  But that's why yeah; you know you should never get that other statin because you've had.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: A bad side effect before.  Are you having any, do you have any chest pain at all or anything like that since you had it that one time?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay um coughing anything like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay and your dizziness I understand is about the weakness.  The weakness is about the same?
PATIENT: Oh the weakness oh yeah that's about the same.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah that's in my legs and stuff there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that's why I'm having surgery so it possibly don't get any worse.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: They talking two different things that could be the cause of it but if I don't [REDACTED] possibly to stop it, it's just gonna get worse regardless so they say the decompression will stop it from getting any worse.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If that, indeed is the cause and not the neuropathy.
DOCTOR: Right exactly, exactly.  They feel, the way I understand it, they feel that it would be better if you had the surgery.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And it might stop the progress of it.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: That's what they're saying.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Which is very reasonable.
PATIENT: It is.
DOCTOR: It could possibly do but you have to know the fact that it might not.
PATIENT: Not be I know yeah but I got to.
DOCTOR: It is a risky of surgery.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um okay.  So I was just looking through your medicines.  You do have an albuterol inhaler ordered.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: How often do you use that?
PATIENT: Hmm maybe once a week.
DOCTOR: Once a week okay.  Who gave that to you?
PATIENT: Uh I think you might have.
DOCTOR: Uh no, I think it was the doctor before me.
PATIENT: Okay right.
DOCTOR: Okay and uh.
PATIENT: I know I take it when I need it.
DOCTOR: Were you wheezing?
PATIENT: No just something like that.
DOCTOR: That's okay.  Did you ever have, have you ever had lung tests done or anything like that?
PATIENT: I think I had something for it, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  How far can you walk before you get, I know you have this pain and everything.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I don't get out of breath.  It's not getting out of breath walking.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's just [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Were you a smoker in the past?
PATIENT: Twenty years ago.
DOCTOR: How long did you smoke for?  How many years?
PATIENT: Okay 20 years ago, I was how old?
SECOND PERSON E413
41.
PATIENT: So I started smoking at 18.
DOCTOR: So you smoked for 25 years.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay so I think, I looked back and I couldn't find any lung function tests at all.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: I think it's reasonable to maybe repeat those.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But you only use that inhaler once or twice a week you said.
PATIENT: Right.  I just want to make sure I've got it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just to be safe, make sure I have it.
DOCTOR: That's fine.  So we can do those lung function tests later.  You don't have to have them before your surgery or anything like that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I don't think it's a pressing issue.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and then you're doing okay with your depression medicine?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] and limiting your salt okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Just the quarterback the Bears had at the end of the year, he had a pinch.  You better hurry up.
DOCTOR: Understandable.  Understandable.  Alright.  And now the one that [REDACTED] this day, you said your test was at Christ?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay well you might have to, can, do you think you can get those records from Christ?
PATIENT: I think so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But you probably could get them before I could.
DOCTOR: From Christ.  Okay we could try to.
PATIENT: But they got them, when I went them they got all my records from here like in the middle of the night almost.
DOCTOR: Right, right, maybe because they faxed them over.  Okay.
PATIENT: If you want to do it that way I don't know.
DOCTOR: Yeah I think, well we don't necessarily need them cause I can document it and that's fine for now because the surgeons.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Will want to see them.  Do you have like a pre-appointment with them or anything?
PATIENT: Not yet when I see you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Then I call her today and then she'll make all the preop things.
DOCTOR: Okay so yeah I think what I would do is try to get it from them, just so you have them.  We don't need them here, we're fine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But as far as they need them but they should be able to give it to you without a problem.
PATIENT: Okay I'll get it.
DOCTOR: Just say you had a negative test and things like that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And that'll make it, that'll make it easier for everybody.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so they're not asking you like why.
PATIENT: Yeah right.
DOCTOR: What the results were and things like that.  Any other problems at all today?
PATIENT: Uh that itching.  I have dry skin but man I just break out itching all over.  I get hot and itchy all over.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Um once a week at least and I got dry skin cream but it's not doing it, I mean it itches and it's driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Have you ever had that before?
PATIENT: Not like that.  It's been, it's been doing it for a while now but I've never asked about it or said anything about it, I just thought it was dry skin or the detergent that I was using.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know those kind of things.
DOCTOR: Any rashes at all anywhere?
PATIENT: I don't know if you call this a rash, it be almost like that.
DOCTOR: Yeah I think that's probably from scratching.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what I think.
DOCTOR: Do you think you have some dry skin maybe?
PATIENT: Yeah I do have dry skin and I have medicine for it but that itches sometime.  I do put a cream on it and it stops it.
DOCTOR: Do you put it on every day?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I think what I would try first before we do anything else is try to use it every day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Even if you're not itchy it'll kind of help you with the itchiness.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Just know just trying to use it every day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then.
PATIENT: I'll be very ashy if I don't use it every day, you can write, I could take my finger and I could write on my whole leg.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean the dry skin probably that's what happens it kind of feeds itself.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let's have you sit up here, I'll take a listen at you. I got you.
PATIENT: There we go.
DOCTOR: Any bowel or bladder or incontinence or anything like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay I know that probably everybody asks you that.
PATIENT: Everybody asks because that's the first doctor told me what I'm having now could cause that.
DOCTOR: Right I understand [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] after the surgery like big time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I don't want that.  I take everything else but I don't want that.
DOCTOR: Deep breath.  Any leg swelling at all or anything like that?
PATIENT: No they're not swollen.
DOCTOR: You can have a seat there.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I call her and she'll set everything up in motion.  Surgery scheduled actually for.

PATIENT: I don’t think so.  I think I'm okay.
SECOND PERSON E413

DOCTOR: Let me see it looks like the depression medicines we're okay with, you've got a bunch of those.  Um the gemfibrozil.
