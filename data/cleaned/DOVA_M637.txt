PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So how you doing?  Pain still?
PATIENT: Yeah I got pain in that knee.
DOCTOR: Right here?
PATIENT: It'd be pain and maybe 24 hours a day.
DOCTOR: Right, that same place in the knee?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Same thing.
PATIENT: Not a lot.  I seen the uh.
DOCTOR: Surgeon right?
PATIENT: Yeah, well I seen those guys and basically that's the only thing that will do any good.
DOCTOR: A knee replacement?
PATIENT: Yeah they got to do that.  Uh I had a [REDACTED] and all that.  I'm on pain pills man and they don't help no more.
DOCTOR: Has it changed in character or it's the same thing right?  Same location, same place?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Same, same location, and the only difference was pain just getting worse.  I had to talk to the Rheumatology I mean they do [REDACTED] about a month ago and they didn’t do anything you know so I always see Orthopedic myself and they say.  I only see those guys you know time and time and I'm constantly telling them and they doing nothing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I go to see the Orthopedics and they say hey you know, that's the only thing going on.  They're gonna ease the pain.  They didn't give me any painkiller either.  They don’t help.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I uh, you know I had this pain in the lung you know, uh so they supposed to do a biopsy uh then they cancelled it, this is the second time they cancelled it.  I was supposed to go on the 16th and they didn't do it now.
DOCTOR: A biopsy of what?
PATIENT: Yeah uh now they tell me on the 23rd.
DOCTOR: Okay, what do they want, what are they doing a biopsy on?
PATIENT: For the lung, uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh for the nodule in there right?
PATIENT: Yeah only on the right [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Did they find this on the CT?  They were going to biopsy it, really?
PATIENT: Yeah, well they was supposed to, well that's what they told me and they cancelled uh twice and they said they didn't have room so now they set it for the 23rd.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I still got that pain in there though.
DOCTOR: It hurts with breathing?
PATIENT: Yeah when I cough you know.
DOCTOR: And that hasn't changed at all either?
PATIENT: No it ain't changed you know it’s, I just, I can hold off on coughing.  If I have to cough it pains me.  And in Rheumatology he ordered it long ago, I mean when they got it in the pulmonary [REDACTED] ordered it and they said they didn't have room or whatever yeah.
DOCTOR: So you're supposed to go this month again?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: On the 16th.
PATIENT: I was supposed to go the 16th.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh when he cancelled it he said they didn't have room so now they move it to the 23rd.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah that's probably something they're gonna take care of for you just ahead but they've got to figure out what that is.
PATIENT: Yeah well if they say I need it, I mean the doctor [REDACTED] he don't know what to do until he get this biopsy and this is the second time he cancelled it.  So I'm gonna see him on the 18th so I could tell him what happened.  They didn't do it.
DOCTOR: Sorry I'm putting in some notes here.  So you're gonna see the lung doctors on the 18th?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: You see the lung doctor on the 18th and then the radiologist who's supposed to do the biopsy?
PATIENT: Yeah, right, right.  I was supposed to do it on the 16th, now they called me and said they only, you know, they're filled up so they moved to the 23rd but I see this doctor on the 18th.  So better check it.
DOCTOR: I think you're gonna have the biopsy that day.  So you'll have to follow it up I guess.
PATIENT: Yeah well he said he don't know what's going on, when he get that.
DOCTOR: Yeah cause they may want to look at the tissue and see.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Because it’s guessing otherwise.
PATIENT: Yeah right.
DOCTOR: So, what do you taking for your pain?
PATIENT: Uh they gave me this, I got Tylenol 3 codeine and it don't help.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I'll tell you.
DOCTOR: I mean we can, we can do other stuff too, or you can go higher than that. That’s not the strongest that we got.  The question is have you ever had a bad reaction with like Vicodin or anything like that?
PATIENT: Well I had some Vicodin, but I had it and it didn't do anything.
DOCTOR: Didn't do anything.
PATIENT: No it didn't do anything uh this Tylenol 3, I want to say it helps a little bit.  But I had the Vicodin in its place and it didn't do nothing.  The doctor over there tell me that the only thing gonna ease the pain, you know the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Is the hip replacement?
PATIENT: Yeah I mean we definitely [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And we can't do that until we figure out what's going on with the lung.
PATIENT: Right so this lung problem is a whole other thing.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] sorry.  Give me one second, I'll be right back.
PATIENT: So this problem is holding up everything.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: See all of this, they always inform me when the appointment is, I mean they are and they said they didn't do it so this is the second time that they moved it up.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Now I thought, when I see him on the 18th and he still want [REDACTED] what I mean.
DOCTOR: Let me call and ask about that. The radiology.  They still have you listed for the 16th.
PATIENT: I know but well they cancelled it doctor.
DOCTOR: Yeah you know I would call them and ask them why.
PATIENT: Yes.  Why.
DOCTOR: And maybe they can just switch you back.  Um.
PATIENT: Yeah because.
DOCTOR: I’m just going to call.
PATIENT: Well I need to get this here.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know.  That's holding everything up so.
PATIENT: That holding up.
DOCTOR: See what we can do here.
PATIENT: Well I'm telling you they called me and said the 23rd which is next Monday instead of this Monday.
DOCTOR: Oh September 23rd or August 23rd, just an extra couple weeks.
PATIENT: Yeah, August the 23rd.
DOCTOR: But they still moved you so okay.  See what's holding it up.
(Doctor calls Radiology)
DOCTOR: Alright so the scanner.
PATIENT: Now this uh.
DOCTOR: You need a refill?
PATIENT: No uh well I just got this but uh, I'm having all kinds of problems with this uh it really, every time I come here well my blood pressure's up and I [REDACTED] senior citizens and it still up.  Now I tell you doctor uh, like at the [REDACTED] they be on me for years.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So they discontinued and then they come up with this drug and then well I had one before this and it didn't do anything at all so now when it has this, it ain't doing anything, it ain't been helping a lot.
DOCTOR: Do you feel bad when you're taking it?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure's great.
PATIENT: I was talking to the um, the Pharmacy in Walgreens and he said he never heard of it.
DOCTOR: What?  That's the most common drug for hypertension.
PATIENT: Yeah I don't know.
DOCTOR: But your blood pressure's really good okay.
PATIENT: Well I had just a little [REDACTED] for a year on that, I've never had any problem and uh they [REDACTED] so everybody trying to figure out what I need just so, but they need to come up with some stuff, I'm telling you this is something that really don't work at all.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright um any fevers or chills?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  No chest pain or shortness of breath?  Just pain and cough right?
PATIENT: Yeah just.
DOCTOR: The same thing you've been having?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah I mean.  I mean you know I'm, nothing new.
DOCTOR: Nothing new.  It's all just about the same alright.
PATIENT: It's all the same.  The only thing wrong is getting worse.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's getting worse.  I talked to Radiology and the problem is they have to fix the CT scanner on that day or that week so there's actually no way you can get it done that week.  I know it's a pain in the ass but they should be ready, you got the appointment for the 23rd.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Did you get the time?
PATIENT: Yeah I have it on the 23rd.
DOCTOR: You've got to make sure you just make that appointment.  So the Pulmonary people, call them and explain to them what's going on, tell them what you told me.  The thing is this issue is holding up everything it's all pain you're having in your hip and you can't have surgery until they figure out what's going on there okay.  (Doctor spoke with someone who came to the door)  I'm sorry.

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I got the Tylenol 3 and I been using that so I take that.
DOCTOR: Alright uh.  Let's see.  I mean the only other thing we could go to is we could go to like morphine but I don't know if I want to do that though.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Will you be able to bear it out at least for a little longer if we give you more of your Tylenol 3, if we make sure you have enough of a constant supply of Tylenol 3?
PATIENT: Yes, uh-huh, so I'll stick with the Tylenol 3 for the time being right now.
