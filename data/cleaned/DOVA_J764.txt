PATIENT: [REDACTED] a lot of things that I want, I be needing to be done.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Every time I came they would uh either it was too late or I would have to come back.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or stuff like that, you know I just couldn't just keep coming back [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: Okay, here's the deal, uh I think [REDACTED] okay and what I think what we will do is that they have been following you for the prostate problem [REDACTED] okay.  And that usually [REDACTED] they know everything about it other than [REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: What I've been thinking about at this point of time is to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] from you is [REDACTED] the problem you are having but from another [REDACTED] you know, [REDACTED] just because I don't want all this information [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Just because [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] right.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That is the reason okay.  Uh Actually I won't be able to give you an answer uh at the same time it would make very [REDACTED] as far as your prostate problem is concerned, [REDACTED] okay.  How do you take that?  Because [REDACTED] possible for me to get all the information from there uh from the computer and at the same time
in addition combine [REDACTED] we might get a couple of weeks or maybe more than that.
PATIENT: Oh, okay.
DOCTOR: And then you come up to the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] right.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay.
DOCTOR: And that is how the [REDACTED] work most of the time uh.  Because many of the times [REDACTED] and [REDACTED].  That is how it goes, okay.  [REDACTED] prostate problem, this is not a small deal, this is something [REDACTED] right.  I would need to gather the proper information from them, from you and from [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay, I see what you're saying.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] okay.  And one other thing that it would be very very, it could be [REDACTED] on your part to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh so that is why I be coming on strongly to you okay.  Uh so [REDACTED].  I know that Jesse Brown is closer to your place but at the same time you think that this is maybe a better place, [REDACTED].  I want the decision to come from you okay.  Uh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I know, I know, I understand [REDACTED].  All the information that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Exactly.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But I've been going over there [REDACTED] uh blood testing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'm you know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: With you know my prostate, this is something that I think that I should handle [REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh, cause I don't know what [REDACTED] told them.  I don't know what, [REDACTED] cancer on me and I have to wear a bag, I'm like [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay, uh.  [REDACTED] let's do the [REDACTED] to answer those questions that you have, but that's [REDACTED].  But most of the time prostate cancer is [REDACTED], but it is not that [REDACTED] okay.  But many of the times, what the doctors do is they just wait and watch, [REDACTED].  Many of the times persons with prostate cancer, not many of the time, but some of the time, they just [REDACTED].  Did you get [REDACTED]?  But at the same time it needs to be done.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well I mean, if something needs to be done since I had the blood test.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: If there are pills, if there's a pill I have to take then [REDACTED] you know.

DOCTOR: And just to [REDACTED] with what they come up with okay, just to get [REDACTED] they come up with them.  [REDACTED] you know, so that we can come with an answer okay.  [REDACTED] somehow to come up with [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay I'll try that.

DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That I could get the information on what I can do about this prostate cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You understand you're at a completely different hospital right?
PATIENT: Yeah I understand that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I think part of it is you just don't really want to get involved [REDACTED] extensive work right now.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: If you would like to transfer your care over here, we can do that but you realize that you know we want you to always come back here [REDACTED].  So I guess the question is do you want to have all your care delivered here?
PATIENT: No I'm [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So does that mean you're going to go back over there?
PATIENT: Yeah.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: We just want to make sure that we know what we're doing here.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Uh-huh.  Okay.  (discussion between both doctors)
PATIENT: Oh uh 524.
DOCTOR: 524, so what's your full social?

I need you to lay down and we're going to do a quick EKG  you had a little bit of chest pain.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: The other day.  To see how you're doing.  [REDACTED] since your last [REDACTED].  So when I heard you weren't too excited about the care you were getting from the nurse practitioner over there, is that correct?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay, so are you looking to go back [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Well I got to go back there because he has all the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.  Have you ever had stress test before?  On your heart.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  When was that?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] was that at Jesse Brown too?  Okay, then we'll be fine [REDACTED].  So what's the one thing you think that we can do for you today as far as [REDACTED].  [REDACTED] not doing for you.  [REDACTED] satisfied customer.  Now we hear that you're having a little bit of numbness and tingling on the bottom of your feet too huh?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright and you're looking to [REDACTED] so um number one your options are um we can, there are a whole bunch of things that can cause uh numbness and tingling in your feet and the first would be [REDACTED] we need to check labs which is what [REDACTED] so.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um our question is whether you want to go ahead and start that [REDACTED] they should be able to get those results at Jesse Brown uh but ultimately we would like to maybe follow up with that, so I guess the question is do you want us to order that today or if you would want um, if you want to just have it over there, it's your call.
PATIENT: What kind of blood test are you doing?
DOCTOR: It's a blood test.  We'd check your thyroid levels, we'd check your um, um, [REDACTED].  We'd check your thyroid levels, we'd check your iron levels um and we'd check your vitamin levels as well [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  You could do that today?
DOCTOR: Yeah we'd have to give you a call for the results and DOCTOR would probably give you a call tomorrow.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  (discussion between two doctors)  [REDACTED].
(Person enters the room, second doctor talks to them)
PATIENT: Well what was that [REDACTED] problem feeling like that?
DOCTOR: You know it's hard to say.  [REDACTED].  You know the one thing we always [REDACTED] a little bit.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Have you ever seen the 40-year-old virgin?
PATIENT: (Laughs).
DOCTOR: Have you seen that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So um, it's hard to say [REDACTED].  It could be an air bubble that stopped, obviously [REDACTED] heart attacks so I think that's pretty low on our worry list.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I was [REDACTED].  To get a full breath in.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It was just half a breath [REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: Now are you uh, are you smoking cigarettes these days?

DOCTOR: And how are you doing uh, so no chest pain since then it sounds like huh?
PATIENT: Not uh since that day.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Now if that ever pops up again, you know I would definitely give a consideration for going to the ER that day.
PATIENT: Well that same day?
DOCTOR: Yeah cause you know [REDACTED] it's kind of hard to say [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah, I'll see if it happens again, I'll you know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Probably yeah let's do that, the vaccine, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But um.  Okay, well DOCTOR is going to talk to you a little bit more about what you'd like to do and then he can give you a list of some of the labs that [REDACTED] and take over here.
