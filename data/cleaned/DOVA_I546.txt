DOCTOR: What?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I’ve got good news and bad news.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] good news.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] walked in.
DOCTOR: So it looks like its working okay for you right?
PATIENT: So far.
DOCTOR: That's good.  I look to see that, you look a little steadier to me.
PATIENT: I haven't felt it.  Um, it [REDACTED] since I've fallen eight times in December.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I fell last night, I don't even know how.  I don't explain how I.
SECOND PERSON I546
How you fell?  You were just standing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON I546
He was just standing. I don't know if you took a drink or were going to and all of a sudden you just went down.
DOCTOR: Okay like blacked out, lost consciousness or?
SECOND PERSON I546
He doesn't remember it, cause he says what happened?
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON I546
So he kind of fell backwards and he hit head.
PATIENT: Again.
SECOND PERSON I546
Again.
PATIENT: I put a hole in the one door.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: Hurt like heck.
DOCTOR: Back in December?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So last night you didn't have any sense like oh my gosh I'm gonna pass out.  You didn't feel palpitations or lightheaded or anything?
PATIENT: No, all of a sudden I was on the floor.
DOCTOR: All of a sudden you're on the floor okay and did anyone see it?  You saw it?
SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Did it look like he passed out?
SECOND PERSON I546
It looked like; well actually he didn't know what happened.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON I546
And it's as if he was awake.  I mean it was very fast, probably five seconds or so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON I546
So it wasn't like the kind fell on the kitchen floor when I said he really was unconscious.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Alright um.
SECOND PERSON I546
His coughing, choking is getting worse.
DOCTOR: Were you doing anything at the time that you passed out?
PATIENT: I was just standing at the counter as I know.
DOCTOR: So you weren't like drinking or eating anything or laughing?
SECOND PERSON I546
I don't know I was at the other end.
PATIENT: I don't think I was drinking anything cause I don't remember.
SECOND PERSON I546
Well you had a glass in front of you but I don't know if he actually drank or not.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't remember.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You didn't lose continence of your bowels or bladder and you didn't urinate on yourself?  You don't shake uncontrollably or anything?
SECOND PERSON I546
No.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And how's your head feel today?
PATIENT: My head feels, well sore where I hit it but my neck is [REDACTED] real sore almost to the touch.  What was the third thing?  There was a third thing we were going to tell you and I forgot.  Neck and fall.  But there's a third thing.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I still can't feel anything as you can tell right there.  I have no idea how I got that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: This was bigger before, it's healed a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have no idea how that happened.
DOCTOR: And how far up does it go, the feel.
PATIENT: The feeling?
DOCTOR: Feel yeah, I mean can you feel anything there?
PATIENT: No
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I can't think of the third thing.  Oh even the therapist recommended I, suggested a wheelchair too.
DOCTOR: Yeah, they were recommending a wheelchair; I saw that in their notes.  Do you have one at home?
PATIENT: No we're gonna, I think we're gonna get one for when I walk long distances like here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Or like go to a mall or whatever.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Do you feel dizzy when that happens?  I mean do you.
PATIENT: Sometimes it takes me a while, when I stand up.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It’s like I get my blood flowing down to my legs.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON I546
I think you should tell her about how you feel in the.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, there's been two times now where like I'll go over and I feel like I'm upside down.
DOCTOR: Upside down like?
PATIENT: I don't know, yeah everything seems like it's upside down.  I'll wake up and I'll feel like I'm off the bed and upside down.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
SECOND PERSON I546
It's more than two times cause he's had that before.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah.  And when he's in the car he feels like what things are.
PATIENT: Roller coaster.
SECOND PERSON I546
Like when you're going down?
PATIENT: Yeah I've mentioned that to her before that.
DOCTOR: Let's see.
PATIENT: See I knew I'd make your day complicated.  But it seems like, I use a snow blower for the snow we’ve been having, as long as I got that in front of me I seem to be okay.
DOCTOR: When you use the snowblower?
PATIENT: Yeah as long as I got something in front of me to hold to.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But when I go to use a cane I don't.
DOCTOR: Yeah, this is, I mean.
PATIENT: So I'm using the snowblower right outside.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Like the other day when I rode a bike to work I had two people [REDACTED].  There was a slight little hill and it was a little bit slippery and they offered and so I took uptown.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright why don't you come over here and.
PATIENT: We'll see what happens.  Let's see the last time [REDACTED] feel like the roller coastering.
DOCTOR: I'm going to have you lay down okay?  [REDACTED] like this.  Any chest pain or trouble breathing?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea, vomiting?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay, diarrhea, constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation means that the bowel movements seem extremely big.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you taking stool softeners right now?
PATIENT: No.  I can't tell, are my words slurred?
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound much worse than the last time that I saw you here.  Now put your left arm out for me.
PATIENT: What's it at?
DOCTOR: That was 134/80.
PATIENT: Now it's come down some.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Now I'm going to have you sit up and we'll check it again.  Do you feel dizzy when you sit up?
PATIENT: A little, not too bad.
DOCTOR: Like the room is spinning or lightheadedness?
PATIENT: Lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in and out.
PATIENT: Where did you go over the holidays?
DOCTOR: Oh I was able to go home.
PATIENT: Oh that's good.
DOCTOR: Yeah it was nice.
PATIENT: You were on the east coast then.
DOCTOR: Yeah Syracuse, New York.
PATIENT: Ooh you got nailed with snow.
DOCTOR: Not as much as uh like New York City and Boston, they are really.
PATIENT: Oh Boston's getting hit again.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My nephew goes to school in Boston and he called yesterday or today?
SECOND PERSON I546
I think it was yesterday.
PATIENT: Oh it was yesterday.
DOCTOR: Syracuse got four feet of snow in four days.
SECOND PERSON I546
Oh my gosh.
DOCTOR: Right before I arrived and then just as I was leaving was when that big blizzard was coming up the east coast and Boston and New York [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON I546
But you got out in time.
DOCTOR: I missed it, I got a nice white Christmas and I missed a lot of the actual snowfall.  So just relax your arm here.  Okay I'm going to [REDACTED] blood pressure.  Okay.
PATIENT: What is it now?
DOCTOR: That was actually, it was 128/80 so.  Pretty darn close so that's good I mean.
PATIENT: There are worse.
DOCTOR: So your blood pressure doesn't seem to be dropping.  That would really explain.  Now normally when you pass out like that is it um, is it when you've been standing up for a while?
PATIENT: No actually I could be sitting.  Remember when I fell in the bedroom, I was sitting and I fell off the bed.
SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah but I, that was just a fall, I don't think it was like a loss of consciousness.
PATIENT: We have some medication to be refilled that they won't let me refill it over the phone?
DOCTOR: Oh yeah we can.
PATIENT: Hopefully we can do it.  Oh shoot, she is going to do that, she's getting the glove.
DOCTOR: Oh, I'm just going to look at the back of your head here.  Do you have any pus or bleeding back here?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of.  [REDACTED].  Up a little bit higher.
DOCTOR: A little bit higher.
PATIENT: Yeah right where your hand was, right in through there.
DOCTOR: There?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I don't see any cuts or anything.  Does that hurt when I'm pushing on it?
PATIENT: No.  Well this time it was a solid wall.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Last time it was the corner.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I thought she was going to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: She don't like to do that.
DOCTOR: The neurologist, alright you had a bunch of falls since the last time you saw the neurologist right?
SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah.
PATIENT: And it's getting scary.
DOCTOR: What are you scared of?
PATIENT: When I fall and I don't know why I fall.
DOCTOR: Cause you don't get any warning right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Alright cause I think, I mean from what it sounds like, we've done a lot of tests, a lot of work-up for the falls, trying to figure out what's going on and we haven't had much luck determining exactly what the cause is.  We know we're thinking that's it's probably multifactorial, that there are a few different things contributing to the falls that we need to try to minimize the risks from a bunch of different things.  Um, without being able to make these episodes go away completely, I think the safest thing would probably be to have a wheelchair and just you know if you're sitting then it's not as hard to fall and that's basically.  I know it's not an answer and it's not very satisfying but for now that'll minimize the risk of hurting yourself when you fall.  Um you know from things from my perspective as a medical doctor what we would worry about is your heart being related.  Like something like having stenosis, like a restriction in some of your heart valves which you don't have based on our last time we checked your heart, um some sort of arrhythmia where your heart is going in and out of rhythm that would cause you to blackout but as far as we know that's not the case either.  Um we would worry about your blood pressure dropping and sometimes that can be a result of just having neurological problems, your body doesn't respond the same way to changes with position and kind of a.
PATIENT: Well what's kind of weird and everything has been the time of the day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It [REDACTED] at night or in the morning or sometimes in the after you know I never know.
DOCTOR: Right.  Um but based on you know what we just did checking your blood pressure in different positions, it doesn't seem like your blood pressure is dropping when you sit up or stand up. Sometimes it's related, it's called vasal vagal and it's like from standing for long periods of time um so it's kind of hard to say.  But from a lot of the things that I'm used to managing and dealing with, we've kind of ruled those things out.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um it may be partly related to some of the medications you're given um, helping one thing can sometimes just bring other problems and it may be related to the ataxia and you know the kind of a big syndrome of stuff you have going on that we're trying to get a handle on.  I don't know, I don't have any great answers for you, I wish I did.
SECOND PERSON I546
What's really hard for him now is he's choking so violently.  He'll sit down and just take one bite.
DOCTOR: He'll turn red and.
SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah and once he just gets through this thing he seems to be okay.  It's just like that first swallows are really violent.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Are you, I saw that you went back and got another swallow evaluation.
SECOND PERSON I546
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Are you using the chin tuck and the maneuvers?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Even when I drink I try to make sure I'm over the table or something.
SECOND PERSON I546
I try to encourage him to take smaller bites and to chew it better.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON I546
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah, I mean.
PATIENT: Or even when it's plain, like we had soup and that went down real easy and I was even coughing with that real bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah soup is actually hard because it's a mixture of consistencies.  You've got stuff that you have to chew.
SECOND PERSON I546
He has yeah, little lumps in it.
DOCTOR: Yeah so you've got to, your mouth has to kind of organize it and swallow things kind of one at a time; you've got the thin stuff and the big stuff.
SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah.
DOCTOR: So that actually can be kind of tricky.  A lot of times what they do is you know try to get people to separate their liquids and their solids.
PATIENT: Well I'm still going like this even when I'm drinking anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay.
PATIENT: It's very, very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I get kind of upset when I start coughing so bad.
DOCTOR: Have you ever tried using like thickening stuff and did that help at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It seems the thinner it is the better it is.
DOCTOR: Really okay.  So you cough more when you're drinking thickened liquids.
PATIENT: Seems like it.
DOCTOR: I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
SECOND PERSON I546
You want to do these medications [REDACTED].
PATIENT: When she gives that.
DOCTOR: Do you know which medications that need refills?
SECOND PERSON I546
Well this one's zero.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON I546
And he said um [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON I546
That he called and wouldn't refill it.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Four refills so [REDACTED].  And that was probably prescribed by the Neurology folks but let me, I'll go over the list with you when I get back.
SECOND PERSON I546
Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  47:15  DOCTOR IN:  56:05)
DOCTOR: Alrighty.  I would like because it's been a while since you had your blood work done, I'd like to do a little bit of blood work to make sure, just check a few things to make sure we're not contributing to the falls that you're having.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I would also like to check an EKG today.
PATIENT: Can you do that up here?
DOCTOR: Uh we'll see if he's here.  He wasn't here this morning but we'll try.
PATIENT: Okay.  It don't like you.
DOCTOR: No [REDACTED].  Now the third thing we'd like to do, I'm going to check like your vitamin D level which is something that's important for building you know strong bones.
PATIENT: It don't want you to do that.
SECOND PERSON I546
Sounds alarming.
DOCTOR: And um the other thing I'd like to do just because of all these falls that are happening, of course we want to avoid the falls as much as we can by um kind of like adapting to what's going on but I'd like to check a DEXA scan of your bones and make sure that you don't have osteoporosis or anything like that.  Some of these medications that you end up on for long periods of time can have a negative effect on your bones and I want to make sure that if you fall your bones are as strong as they can be to avoid a fracture.
PATIENT: I haven't broke anything yet.
DOCTOR: I know but we don't want to [REDACTED] that can be a devastating problem.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Once it happens so it's an easy test um, I'll put in the order for that and they can schedule it for you um.  You may need to call and schedule it actually but we'll see.
SECOND PERSON I546
I should ask the dietician like stuff I should do cause I've fallen twice in the last month.
DOCTOR: Oh no.  Have you had a DEXA scan?
SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah we commonly get them for women but we don't really think of it for men.
SECOND PERSON I546
I take Vitamin D too.
PATIENT: Just what I need more pills.
SECOND PERSON I546
I know.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D isn't that bad, if you need it you take it once a week.
SECOND PERSON I546
Those are those pretty green pills.
PATIENT: I thought they checked once for vitamin D.
DOCTOR: I can check and see when the last time was.  The last time you had labs here was a while ago.  They tried before but I guess they didn't get a good enough blood for it.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: We'll try again.
PATIENT: When do you want my medication reviewed?
DOCTOR: Let's see what we've got for medications.
PATIENT: Um I need amlodipine.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I have nothing left on that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Etodolac, I only got two left on that and that really really works.
SECOND PERSON I546
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: The what?
SECOND PERSON I546
[REDACTED].  It says there are four refills.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON I546
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So you've got, you filled it in July, August, then did you stop taking it for a while or?
PATIENT: I don't have any.
DOCTOR: Uh when did you try to refill it?
PATIENT: Uh this week sometime.
DOCTOR: Okay what do you take that for?
PATIENT: I don't even know.
DOCTOR: It's like an allergy medication.  Were you?
PATIENT: Okay, probably for my nose.
DOCTOR: Allergy problems?
PATIENT: Well, it seems I do but I don't know what I'm allergic to.  I'm allergic to coffee and uh or caffeine and penicillin, that's all I know of.
DOCTOR: But like seasonal allergies, stuffy nose, postnasal drip, stuff like that?
PATIENT: Stuffy nose all the time.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: Then I got one more.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  I think that's it.
DOCTOR: Alright, oh sorry did you need those to pick those up in the Pharmacy or did you want them mailed?
PATIENT: No I'll just get them mailed if they can.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay, alright.
PATIENT: It's easier that way.
DOCTOR: So I'd like you to get that EKG done, we'll see if they can do it for you up here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But if not you may need to go down to the um Cardiology Lab down on the first floor.  So let me see if he's here, if not I'll give you directions.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright he's not here so we'll have you go downstairs.  Um so you'll go down, you know where the Lab is downstairs right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so we'll have you go there to get the blood tests done and then I'd like you to go to the, you can kind of, I think there are signs up that say like EKG testing.  It'll be on the first floor and you'll head towards four corners.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But uh before you get to four corners you'll turn left down what seems like kind of an empty hallway alright.
PATIENT: I've been there before.
DOCTOR: Yeah, it's between the elevators and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's down to the basement floor.
DOCTOR: Oh did they send you down there?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: For the EKG?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  I've been told to send people it's on the first floor.
PATIENT: I'm going there, its close.
DOCTOR: You can ask yeah, ask around maybe they'll tell you I'm wrong but that's where I've been told to send people before.
PATIENT: So all the previous [REDACTED] Building 228.
DOCTOR: Yeah so, yeah see what you can find out.  If they send you to the basement I apologize.  Alright and I'll let you know what I find out from the tests and what the results are of the DEXA scan.
PATIENT: Okay and we're all set then right?
DOCTOR: Yep.
SECOND PERSON I546
And have they called them about the prescriptions.
DOCTOR: Uh yeah I mean I put the order in the computer so you can ask them up front if they can schedule for you, if not then [REDACTED].
PATIENT: We just usually call.  We need to check the calendar at home.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON I546
We always do.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Take care, be safe okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, do we give this to the guy up there?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  We'll see you, take care.
PATIENT: We'll see what happens.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: When do you want to see me again?
DOCTOR: Um it's in there, three months, three to four months.
PATIENT: Okay.  Okie doke.
PATIENT: 67:50
Time is 11:25.
