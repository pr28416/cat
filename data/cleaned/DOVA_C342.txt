PATIENT: Oh I don't know let's see um it's been eight or nine years I think.
DOCTOR: And you’re, you're not working because, what's the reason?  Is it because of the schizophrenia, you didn’t work or?

PATIENT: Next one is April 12th.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Cause I can fill some of this out but the reason for your disability is schizophrenia right, so I can't really describe you know how it interferes with your work.  I'll talk the DOCTOR to see if there's something else we can do but maybe your psychiatrist would be better filling out some of this stuff.
PATIENT: Well uh my social worker gave that to me and told me to bring it, that's about all I can say.

DOCTOR: No belly pain, no.
PATIENT: Nope.

PATIENT: Yes.

PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Let me take a listen to you.  Deep breath.  Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: How much?
PATIENT: About a pack a day.
DOCTOR: Pack a day.  Any thoughts of quitting?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Why not?
PATIENT: I kind of like smoking.
DOCTOR: You know it's harmful for you right?
PATIENT: Well I believe it's harmful for some and not harmful to others.
DOCTOR: It's harmful to everybody.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: It'll, you don't feel anything and then all of a sudden it's, it gets to the point where your lungs are too affected and you can't get in any oxygen.  People end up on oxygen at home, end up on breathing machines because they can't breathe cause their lungs don't function as well.  It causes a lot of problems.  It causes heart problems.  People that smoke tend to have heart attacks a lot earlier than people that don't smoke um so and it is a lot of money, it's getting more expensive so.  That's what I want you to do for the next time I see you.  I want you to think about quitting.
PATIENT: Or I'll cut back quite a bit maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I mean I can't say no to that but my goal is to get you to quit okay.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: So think about it and make a list of all the good and bad things about smoking um okay.
PATIENT: Yep.
