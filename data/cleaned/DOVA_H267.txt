How are you today?
DOCTOR: Uh I'm actually doing pretty good myself.  Getting kind of tired but.
SECOND PERSON H267
Yeah.
PATIENT: I think I'm pretty good cause I'm still breathing.
DOCTOR: I saw that you saw the Hematology doctors.

DOCTOR: The doctors about your blood.
PATIENT: Yeah I saw them.  I just had the blood drawn today.
DOCTOR: Yeah I already checked, it wasn’t back.
PATIENT: Yeah I just had it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I just had it drawn uh about 12:30.
DOCTOR: About 12:30 so it probably won't come back till a little bit later.  Right and how have your blood sugars been at home?
PATIENT: Blood sugar, it was 137 today, it's been pretty good.
DOCTOR: So you're checking every day?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: What time do you check it?
PATIENT: Uh this morning.  You got uh, I wake up late.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm just going to be typing as we talk okay.
PATIENT: Okay I wake up late so it varies because I stay up late.  Uh most of the time it'd be around 2 o'clock when I take it.
DOCTOR: Is this after you've eaten something?
PATIENT: Uh only coffee.
DOCTOR: So only after coffee?
PATIENT: Right uh-huh, after I've had my cup of coffee.
DOCTOR: Do you have any low sugars?
PATIENT: No it's never low.
DOCTOR: What's it range from?
PATIENT: It ranges between 100 and sometimes it'll get up around 190.
DOCTOR: Okay that's the highest it goes?
PATIENT: Yeah that's about as high as it goes.
DOCTOR: Okay because you're hemoglobin A1c which is the measure of how tightly controlled your blood sugars are, when we checked it the last time it was a little bit elevated.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So uh I think we're gonna have to probably go up on your medicine.
PATIENT: Again?
DOCTOR: Yeah because well let's see, so I saw you back in February, oh no you know because I think I had seen you back in October.
PATIENT: I seen a letter about the.
DOCTOR: You saw DOCTOR.
PATIENT: I saw DOCTOR then I saw someone else too.
DOCTOR: The blood doctor right?
PATIENT: Right and I saw them yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah so we had cut back on it but we need to go up on it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um back in October.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you're on 40 units right?
PATIENT: Right that's the same amount I'm taking now, 40.
DOCTOR: We can actually go up to 45.
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But okay.
DOCTOR: How do you feel about that?
PATIENT: Well if you think its necessary I mean.
DOCTOR: The only thing is as long as your blood sugars aren't running low.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: On either number.
PATIENT: They're never running low.
DOCTOR: Never lower than 100?
PATIENT: The only time is if I miss a meal, then I might run low.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But generally they never run low.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So if that's the case then we'll go up a little bit more.
PATIENT: Okay.  I was thinking all along, she’s probably going to raise it.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON H267
He was just high.
DOCTOR: So you know we want the goal of your A1c below 7.  Yours is 8.3.
SECOND PERSON H267
That's the same as was back then.
PATIENT: I thought, well what was it last time?
DOCTOR: Before it was actually better, it was 7. something.
PATIENT: It was 7 [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Now it will happen, it could be that your eating habits have changed but elevated or not [REDACTED] little bit more insulin.
PATIENT: But it could be so if I'm not getting along as well since it's been cold.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And when it's cold my hip is bothering me and I don't move as much as when it's warm.
DOCTOR: So why don't we go up by 5 units.  If you start getting anything below 100.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Then you just cut it down to just say 43 units.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Uh but keep it in the 40s and then if, like I said, if you do it at 45, if you suddenly have lower readings below 100.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Then cut it back down so it would be 43 units.  If you're still getting low readings then cut it down to 40.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, I just have to bring it back down if it's low, I get it okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Right, okay.
DOCTOR: And um this.
PATIENT: There's something I need to see, it's one of the things I need you to see.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: They wanted me to see [REDACTED] doctor.  It's about my vitamin D.
DOCTOR: Oh you're vitamin D levels?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Let's see.  Yeah so this is actually pretty low.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And we can actually; we can probably set you up for a supplementation for your vitamin D.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And it's one pill that you'll take every week.
PATIENT: It's once a day?
DOCTOR: It's once a week.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: And you'll take it for about you know a few months.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then we'll recheck your levels.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me see.  Oh this is from last year.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Do you take any vitamin D supplements were you given anything?
PATIENT: No they didn't give me anything.  They placed me on that, I know the last time I was in, they forgot to give it to me, DOCTOR when I saw DOCTOR and uh but I told him that I was going to go back on it so to get it for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, well yeah last time you didn't get started taking anything so it's probably still low.
PATIENT: Right and tell me what does that vitamin D do?
DOCTOR: Well it actually helps; the higher your vitamin D is the better it is for your bones.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And uh the lower your vitamin D, you are at an increased risk of when you fall of having your bones break.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Yeah so.
PATIENT: I don’t want that.  Then let's um.
DOCTOR: And how's your breathing been?
PATIENT: Breathing is about the same.
DOCTOR: About the same.
PATIENT: It's still bad.  I get out of breath easily.
DOCTOR: So you haven't been using the CPAP?
PATIENT: The CPAP, what is that?
DOCTOR: The CPAP do you use that?
PATIENT: If you mean the breathing machine?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I don't have a breathing machine; I have a sleep apnea machine.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's what I meant by it.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Do you use it?
PATIENT: Hmm sometimes, not like I should.
DOCTOR: How come?
PATIENT: It's uncomfortable, I'm scared of it.
DOCTOR: You could maybe try to get it re-fitted.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So maybe that's why it's, because it's uncomfortable for you.
PATIENT: Hmm, we tried uh you know the stick in your nose.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Tried that and then we tried the mask and it still.
DOCTOR: Still uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Still uncomfortable.  I'm going to, what I'm gonna do is start using it regularly and uh see how if I can get used to it.  If I can just get used to it being on my face.  I'm not used to anything covering my nose and face so I'm gonna try it and see how that works.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H267
Um, is it true that they had found something new uh that you don't have to use the mask?
DOCTOR: For the CPAP?
SECOND PERSON H267
Uh for the CPAP treatment.
DOCTOR: No, do you know what um.
SECOND PERSON H267
Somewhere I saw or heard about it on the TV or something.  It's a medication I think instead of the machine.
DOCTOR: Hmm for sleep apnea, not that I know of.
SECOND PERSON H267
Well maybe it's not, maybe it's new.
DOCTOR: Because you know the reason why the medication is not [REDACTED].  So I don't know, I don't think there's any medications that actually change this – change that.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON H267
Well you, it's probably not just kind of pills, sometimes he gets aggravated with me because I wake him up.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  And the other problem is the longer you don't use the CPAP the higher your risk of developing high blood pressure of the arteries of your lungs.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And that can be very dangerous.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Uh and that's why it's really important for you to.
PATIENT: To use that machine.
SECOND PERSON H267
So what do you mean about high blood pressure from the arteries of your lungs?
DOCTOR: Uh you can, just probably over time and you develop what's called pulmonary hypertension.
SECOND PERSON H267
Oh.
DOCTOR: And that uh.
PATIENT: What you say, that means what?
DOCTOR: Like how you have high blood pressure of, we give medication for, for your arteries.
PATIENT: Uh-huh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No you can actually get that of the blood vessels of your lungs, uh the blood vessels of your heart that kind of leads to your lungs.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: And um and that's much harder to treat.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
SECOND PERSON H267
But it is treatable?
DOCTOR: Well not really.
SECOND PERSON H267
Not successfully?
DOCTOR: Uh sometimes if the pressure gets so high you can be on home oxygen.
PATIENT: Uh-huh [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON H267
What is a really dangerous blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Uh for the lungs?
SECOND PERSON H267
For anything.
DOCTOR: Well I mean, usually our goal blood pressures for you, when you come in here and we want your blood pressure to be about 130/80.
PATIENT: Hmm.  Well today my blood pressure was 112/73.
DOCTOR: Yeah actually that's good.
PATIENT: So I could take off, stay on my blood pressure medicines?
DOCTOR: Yeah that's actually great; it's good that you should stay there.
PATIENT: Oh okay, alright.  Cause I thought it was too low.
DOCTOR: No it's actually normal.  Less than 120/80 is normal.
PATIENT: Oh is that, okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah so.  Um do you need any refills today?
PATIENT: Yes I do.  I need refills on um uh all of my uh, like the insulin, the insulin uh the syringes I don't have any refills on the syringes and my testing strips.
DOCTOR: Okay.
SECOND PERSON H267
Nothing else?
PATIENT: Yeah I have a one more and my uh I need a refill on the Cialis.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Anything else?
PATIENT: That's all.  Cause I have refills on the rest of them.  DOCTOR gave me refills on most of them the last time.
SECOND PERSON H267
Last time you were here?
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON H267
Okay.
DOCTOR: So do you want to get those, pick them up while you're here?
PATIENT: Uh you can have them mailed to me.
DOCTOR: Mailed to you.
PATIENT: Cause I have enough to last me for a couple of weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me have you sit down so we can listen to you.
PATIENT: Do you need me to take my coat off?
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: Okay.  Oh you know something else, I almost forgot, my um my right leg it keeps swelling up.
DOCTOR: When?
PATIENT: Oh this last week it swelled up, it's about every day.  I don't know if something's cutting off my circulation or what.
DOCTOR: So do you have any pain when you walk?
PATIENT: Yes I do.
DOCTOR: In your legs?
PATIENT: Yes uh, I contribute that to -  you know I need a hip replacement and I don't want to do that but the swelling, that shouldn't cause the swelling though right?
DOCTOR: So, do you try putting your feet up?  Have you been on your feet a lot?
PATIENT: Well I'm not on it a whole lot but uh.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna have you um roll up your pants.
PATIENT: See I think uh it's swelled right now.
DOCTOR: So let me see the other one too.  And it kind of swells up then goes down?
PATIENT: It swells up and then it, both of them are swelling now.
SECOND PERSON H267
But I know your feet have swelled for the last.
PATIENT: Yeah the swelling in my leg.
SECOND PERSON H267
Your right leg.
PATIENT: Yeah it's mostly the right one.
SECOND PERSON H267
Uh-huh.

PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I'll press it.
SECOND PERSON H267
You want them both up?
DOCTOR: Yes and do you take a water pill at all?
PATIENT: Yes I take that for my blood pressure.  I think that's what blood.
SECOND PERSON H267

PATIENT: She wants the sock off too?
SECOND PERSON H267
Do you want the sock off?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] socks.
SECOND PERSON H267
It's swollen.
DOCTOR: And you didn't hurt yourself?
PATIENT: Not that I know of.  They just, I was watching TV.
DOCTOR: And how often do you get this?
PATIENT: Well, looks like all last week it's been swelling.
DOCTOR: And then the swelling goes down?
PATIENT: When I lay down and wake up it goes down.  But when I'm up and moving around it swells up.
DOCTOR: So one of the things that um.
SECOND PERSON H267
She wants this up.
DOCTOR: Is it right here?
PATIENT: Right in there, where you just had.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  And you didn't hurt yourself right?
PATIENT: No I don't remember.
SECOND PERSON H267
No.
PATIENT: No I don't feel any real pain in it.
DOCTOR: So why don't you, it this okay when I'm pressing?
PATIENT: It's okay.
DOCTOR: It's okay.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Can you move your ankle for me, there's no pain there?
PATIENT: No it's, that's the way it was.
SECOND PERSON H267
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'm just thinking it had something to do with the circulation or something.
DOCTOR: Well you know I think they tested your circulation when you were in Podiatry.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And the circulation of blood to your legs is okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: But there's got to be something for it to swell up like that.  We'll let you know, next time it swell up maybe I take a picture of it and let you see.
SECOND PERSON H267
That one is swollen now.
PATIENT: Well this one is [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So it looks like your ankle here is swollen here.
SECOND PERSON H267
Okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: It could just because this is your bad hip right?
PATIENT: It is.
DOCTOR: So that you might actually be um using your, to compensate for your hip.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You might be putting more pressure on your.
PATIENT: Yeah I do do that.
DOCTOR: On the joints and that would cause you swelling.  It's, I don't think it's anything to be worried about right now.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But the thing is if it gets swollen and it stays swollen.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And it becomes red and hot uh that's when we need to think about there's maybe clot in your leg or if you have an infection in your leg.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: That doesn't seem to be the case.
PATIENT: Well then at night if I lay down, if I go to sleep when I wake up then it's down.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's another thing too is you could be putting a lot of pressure on that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But you're gonna naturally have a little bit more swelling.
PATIENT: Should I just, kind of keep [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
