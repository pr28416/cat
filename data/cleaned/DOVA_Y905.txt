DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay and I have like a tingling sensation in my leg and my back, everything's on my left side and then they did a MRI and then they never told me anything else about my prostate when they found a spot on it.
DOCTOR: Oh it looks like you're seeing the prostate doctors right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And uh yeah I think that was your kidney that they found the spot on, not the prostate.
PATIENT: Oh the kidney.
DOCTOR: Right so I think they didn't really think much of it, kind of reading their notes.  They just wanted to follow you.
PATIENT: They told me my prostate was swelled and there was a spot on my prostate.
DOCTOR: No they said.
PATIENT: A lesion.
DOCTOR: In your prostate?
PATIENT: Yeah.

Well you know for the pain you're having in your leg and your back you know we could probably do physical therapy cause we haven't sent you to Physical Therapy.  Um.
PATIENT: You know I'm doing a lot of exercising myself so I don't even know if physical therapy would work.
DOCTOR: You know otherwise there's not, I mean I could send you to see the orthopedic surgeons to see if they'd like to operate on you but other than that there's not a whole lot we can do for arthritis.
PATIENT: Okay so that, actually everything I'm having in my leg that's due to arthritis?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
