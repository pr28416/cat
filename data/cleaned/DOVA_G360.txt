DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I did.  I looked at most of this already and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay I was just making they sent it to you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No I got it, thank you for doing that.  Um how you doing?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I saw you last in December since I saw you you followed up with the cardiologist.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um and that they're thinking you need to do the [REDACTED] again.
PATIENT: Yeah that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah. Did you see DOCTOR?  [REDACTED] I don’t see a doctor’s note.
PATIENT: Yeah I seen um.
DOCTOR: DOCTOR?
PATIENT: Yes DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] I’m not sure what his plan is.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  He's going to start me on.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Pavix and then.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And he wanted to take me off the Coumadin.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh and have you stopped the Coumadin?
PATIENT: No I've been still taking it.
DOCTOR: He wanted you to stop it though you’re not sure?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No they gave me refills for it, so...
DOCTOR: So you have you started the amlodipine [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: No, he mailed it. So I don’t have it yet.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] cause your blood pressure is really high today so, I just wanted to see how long you’ve been taking that at all so we definitely need to get you take that medicine.
PATIENT: So I'll have like three blood pressure pills?
DOCTOR: Yeah so you have the amlodipine, the metoprolol and the lisinopril.  Lisinopril will also protect your kidneys.  It helps your blood pressure but also your kidney protection because of your diabetes.  That one kind of works in two ways okay.  Um you know we can kind of cut back on that you know, like I said you can always, everyone can lose weigh. If you lose weight it will bring your blood pressure down, watching your salt intake [REDACTED] under control so these aren't permanent medicines you know if everything gets improve you can always get off of those okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But right now your blood pressure is too high, we need to control that.  High blood pressure is going to cause a heart attack, a stroke and we don't want that, you really don't. We try to prevent anything bad from happening.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Did you ever have that tooth surgery?
PATIENT: Yeah I did.
DOCTOR: Did you stop the penicillin or are you gonna keep going on it.
PATIENT: No I stopped it for uh um, I stopped it two days prior and then one afterwards. And [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then one day [REDACTED] and then I just started [REDACTED].  I've been taking two.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So, I’ve been taking two pills a day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  So looking through their notes, I see no clear indication on why you’re on the Coumadin, okay.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: And the only reason [REDACTED].  There is questionable thrombus in your ventricle in one of the chambers of your heart.  But we did the ultrasound of the heart here and we didn't see anything there okay.  It could have been that the clot already dissolved.  The Coumadin helped and your body resolved the clot okay.  Um so I agree with DOCTOR, I think its okay to stop the Coumadin okay.  There's no reason right now that you're on it that we can find um.  It's either because people have clots in their legs or their lungs um or there gonna need it for their heart but for you I think it'll be safe to stop it.
PATIENT: Alright.  The only reason they put me on it is because I.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah right after the heart surgery.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, yeah.
PATIENT: Probably about nine or ten months later.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They came in and said [REDACTED].  They put a stent in one.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They said the other one was too small to put a stent in and that's when they put me on the Coumadin to kind of thin it out.
DOCTOR: But that’s not a normal indication. So, that’s what I’m saying. I don't agree with the way they do that and neither does DOCTOR so um normally they have [REDACTED] stent Plavix is the medicine that you’re on.  That is the medicine that’s recommended.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Along with the aspirin.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] are you waiting for that to be mailed as well?
PATIENT: He put in the order yesterday.
DOCTOR: So if you feel safer, they can [REDACTED] with the Plavix um but I would definitely recommend stopping the Coumadin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's if you feel safer for that.  I don't think you need it but if it's gonna make you feel better its okay.  The Plavix and the aspirin alone are going to cause enough blood thinning that it shouldn't be a problem.  But taking all three of those, there is a pretty high risk of bleeding. So I would recommend aspirin and the Plavix.
PATIENT: Yeah I take Plavix, [REDACTED] took me off it.
DOCTOR: Did DOCTOR mention when he was planning on doing the angiogram?
PATIENT: No he said there really wasn't a really a big rush.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But he would like to hurry up and get it down but, uh
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  So I can have, I assume all your records and I’ll put them in my notes so I'm going to put my notes with DOCTOR and I'll discuss with you what we should do and when we should do it okay.  Have you been having any chest pain or trouble breathing?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Well, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I do have uh shortness of breath.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But then if I rest a couple of minutes or so.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know it's normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you had some blood tests recently.
PATIENT: Yeah I went to the Lab.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Last time we checked your kidney function, it was just a touch higher than normal and if we were going to do an angiogram, they use dye for that and we want to make sure your kidney function is good.  So [REDACTED] do it today or the next time you come we can do the blood work-up but the cardiologists are want us to check your kidney function again okay before anything happens.  Um have you been checking your sugars at home?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And how have they been running?
PATIENT: Uh pretty normal, generally in the 120s.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Are you taking the metformin and the glipizide?
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].  Blood pressure is fine.  There's something else.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.  So I'm down [REDACTED] diabetes metformin and uh.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The glipizide.
DOCTOR: The glipizide uh-huh.  And you have the blood pressure meds and you saw dermatology and they put you on some creams?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: How's that doing?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's doing okay?  Okay.  And how's your back pain doing?
PATIENT: Uh well I take a couple of pain pills at the end of the day.  But it doesn't hurt right now.
DOCTOR: Good, good and what have you been doing? Are you working or no?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  Are you doing any activity or?  Like walking or any kind of exercise?
PATIENT: Like?
DOCTOR: Like walking, or any kind of exercise?
PATIENT: Uh sometimes [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You need to increase your activity okay.  Like I said weight loss and exercise can help with your blood pressure and your diabetes okay and it's good for your heart.  I'm not saying go run marathons and no, get yourself all worked up but you can do a half hour walk a day, you know, it's not much.  I know it's cold outside, it's hard to go outside but go to a mall or someplace indoors or access to a pool or a gym you know.  I think that's gonna be the best medicine for you is to get yourself a little bit more activity every day okay.  Um it's gonna help with everything. It's going to help you breathe better and eventually you might be a little tired [REDACTED] but if you do it in time you're gonna get better and better and I think in the end you could get off of some blood pressure medicines.  You could get off some of your diabetes medicines.  You know we can get you back in a healthy 43 year-old, 46 year-old.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So this is something that you have to work on okay, no one's going to help you do that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Fevers or chills?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Trouble urinating or having bowel movements?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No, okay.  Anything else that's been bothering you or specific questions that you have?
PATIENT: Not really.
DOCTOR: So we're gonna get the Plavix and you're gonna start that.  You're gonna stop the Coumadin, if that's okay with you.  I believe its okay. I believe it’s safe. Um and you can continue that blood pressure medicine, including the new one that DOCTOR added.  Do you have a blood pressure machine at home?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Have you been checking your blood pressure at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No okay.  I want you to try doing it a couple times a week and maybe put it on a piece of paper and keeping track of it.  You better call us so we can see what your blood pressures are at home and we'll what they are in the clinic and if they're a little higher than they normally are and I see at home that your blood pressure is a more normal level again, I can take you off some of your pills okay.  You could check one day in the morning and one day at night and one day at lunch then – it doesn’t have to be every day, you know once in a while. Just keep the machine out where it’s easy to access. And just jot it down for us. Like I said, when you come in, we really look at one number and we focus on that one number and it might be lower at home at well.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED] Did you feel the earthquake today?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Did you hear about it?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] on the radio.  So I don't know.
DOCTOR: Any trouble with your vision?  Say ah.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] over here, [REDACTED] some spots?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  [REDACTED]. Are you using [REDACTED] shampoo? [REDACTED] Everything doing fine?
PATIENT: Yeah that's fine.
DOCTOR: You smoking?
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: Are you smoking?
PATIENT: Uh sometimes I do.
DOCTOR: How much?
PATIENT: Uh [REDACTED] pack a month [REDACTED] 2 or three a day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  It's really bad for your lungs.  Exercise and get in shape, that includes smoking..[REDACTED] okay.
PATIENT: They say.
DOCTOR: No alcohol?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know.  [REDACTED].  You know it's bad.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].   A good cigar.
DOCTOR: How about alcohol?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Any other drug use?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Heroin, cocaine?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: When was the last time you felt some chest pain?
PATIENT: Long time. I haven't felt pain since my surgery.
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath. How often are you getting that?
PATIENT: Oh, I get it if I walk too far or something like that or I run too far.
DOCTOR: Do you park, or do you do the valet here?
PATIENT: I park.
DOCTOR: Did you have any trouble walking in here?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Good.  Now deep breath for me in and out.  Any swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] anything concerning for you? [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So let's have a plan for what we need to right now.  I'll be talking with DOCTOR and see if we can get this angio set up for you.  I don't think it's urgent but I think it'd be beneficial for you.  I know you've had a couple in the last year.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] so um, but it's just because we don't want you know having another.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know but it's better than  having a heart attack and dying to right?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Um our cardiologists are very good.  So we want to see what they can do for you. [REDACTED] and like I said the best thing we can do is.
PATIENT: Does the VA put you under?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  [REDACTED] you don't remember or feel anything.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: No you're not completely out but you have anesthesia and on a breathing machine but you're pretty out of it.
PATIENT: I know the first one they did.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] but on the next two they didn't and that was really painful. That's why I asked you that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me go talk to my attending to see if we can get the bloodwork now or wait a little bit longer since we don’t know when your angio will be.  If he does want it right now we might have to ask you to come back. But we have a guy who can do it right now so we don’t have to stick you [REDACTED].
PATIENT: They don’t check blood levels up there?
DOCTOR: They only checked your Coumadin level, that's all they checked so.  Give me one second I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT: 22:26  DOCTOR IN:  28:37)
DOCTOR: Okay so [REDACTED] do the blood work right now [REDACTED].  Um one thing he wanted me to talk to you about is um your sugars have been very well controlled and he really thinks that we could get away with just one of those diabetes medicines rather than two so I wanted to talk to you about if you were willing to try - how you feel about having just one of those medicines?  Kind of limit the number of the pills that you're taking.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Your sugar was pretty well controlled and your last A1c that we look at, that averages the sugar, it's pretty low and there are some studies saying that [REDACTED] you don't want to drop them too low on the sugars so um.  What I would recommend is you're on the metformin and the glipizide.  We could stop the glipizide and increase the metformin to 1000 mg twice a day you're taking 500 twice a day right now and that might be enough to control your blood sugars.  Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So, would that be okay with you? Okay.  So I'm going to delete [REDACTED] for you.  We're going to stop this medicine and we're going to increase this medicine and then [REDACTED]. We take another look at your sugars.  We get the average, we recheck it and can see how it is and if we have to [REDACTED] at that time.  Hopefully you won't have to.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um so no blood work, keep the rest of the medicines the same, just like DOCTOR said, I'll send my note to him and I’ll see when we can schedule this angio.  In the meantime increase your activity, try to cut back on the smoking and all that okay.  Does that make sense?  Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Any questions or concerns about that?
PATIENT: Uh no, no.
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: You're fine.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Stay warm this winter okay.  I'm gonna see you in four months foll-up for you [REDACTED] but call [REDACTED] schedule the angio.  Is that okay?
PATIENT: That's fine.
DOCTOR: Check that blood pressure once in a while and [REDACTED].  Okay.  You got it?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay you're gonna take a left and a right.
PATIENT: Thank you.
