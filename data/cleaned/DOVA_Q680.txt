DOCTOR: Out of work a good thing? [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No a bad thing.
DOCTOR: The bad things, oh [REDACTED] that.
PATIENT: That's why I've been gaining weight.  Well I knew I was gaining because I used to work out all the time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I'd weigh myself at the health place and I'd say oh no this has gotta be wrong you now.

PATIENT: Oh not, would I be given any tests or anything?
DOCTOR: So we.
PATIENT: My wife is worried because she says [REDACTED] not doing anything?
DOCTOR: No, no.  The most important thing to do is and you've had stents in the past is make sure your cholesterol is well controlled, your blood pressure and your weight.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's the best way to prove that you won't have uh heart atack
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Or have to use another stent.  We don't usually do stress tests on a regular basis.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And we don't use echos or any kind of angiograms or anything unless you have pains or symptoms.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: If you were to have any chest pain at all you would need one of those.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: But since you've done so good since your stents.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That it's not really indicated unless you have some new symptoms.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So it's not like you can go on regular tests for your heart.  The most important test for your heart is cholesterol and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh okay.  So that would be checked [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, we would definitely check it.
PATIENT: Okay, cholesterol.
DOCTOR: Typically we check your cholesterol every year at least.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And um.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We normally do tests at least once or twice a year for your potassium because you're on the lisinopril.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And the lisinopril could increase your potassium.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Your potassium levels are fine, it's never been a problem but every time we check your cholesterol that's something we can check.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright now like I said you're due for a potassium test.  So if you decide, after you're done, we might have you go down there and have them just check it real quick.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: And we're going to see if your potassium is okay.
PATIENT: Okay and then cholesterol test [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Your cholesterol, your last cholesterol was in August so you'll be due.
PATIENT: Yeah cause that was [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] this summer so we'll go ahead and order it for you.

DOCTOR: And you can have that at your convenience and have you have to be fasting for that.
PATIENT: Yeah uh-huh.  But they'll call me or do I have to call?
DOCTOR: You can come any time to the Lab.
PATIENT: Oh alright.
DOCTOR: Any time at all.
PATIENT: Okay, but I figured now that I'm off I'd have more time.
DOCTOR: You have more free time sure yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: At your convenience, you have to come in fasting.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: When you get the labs drawn.
PATIENT: So as long as I fast okay.
DOCTOR: And then I can 92% of the time I'll give you a call back or [REDACTED] will come to my in basket.  If you get [REDACTED] who doesn't I might not know that you had it so, they usually always come back to my [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll give you a call if everything is okay.  So for your heart you're still taking the lisinopril 2.5, you're still taking the metoprolol 50 twice a day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Plavix and then aspirin right?
PATIENT: Yeah, a baby aspirin.
DOCTOR: A baby aspirin. Four drugs that we really, really need.  For your cholesterol you're taking three medications for your cholesterol.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: The niacin, the gemfibrozil and the simvastatin alright.

DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And after that I was fine.
DOCTOR: So you ended up having a hernia?
PATIENT: I think yes, yeah mesh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh good.
PATIENT: And uh you know, several weeks of just taking it easy [REDACTED] and then uh after about a month or more back to normal.
DOCTOR: So, when was it, remember, the last time you described the exact symptoms of a hernia.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But we didn't see it; it wasn't out when we saw it.  Did it come back?
PATIENT: Yeah the pain was there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It was always there and so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: One time I was lying there and then I, my wife she went to Walgreens, they gave her suggested these pants.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that helped in the meantime until uh I had the operation.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: So I was wearing that every day, the hernia belt and I was wearing that every day until like several weeks later and I had the operation.
DOCTOR: So when do you think you had the operation?
PATIENT: Uh October.
DOCTOR: October?  Good, good for you, well that's good.

PATIENT: I do cardio for about a half hour of cardio and then leg lifts and you know some days are easier, some days are longer you know.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: Well the only other thing that I see that I don't think that we talked about before is that you don't have diabetes based on what we have but your sugars are on the higher end of normal.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Just one more thing to keep your eye on.  It's usually less than 100 for your fasting sugars [REDACTED] and yours is 108.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: If it was 176, you would be a diabetic.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So it's just something to keep an eye on.  You know, take out all the salt and the good fat [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] nothing but we still need to keep an eye on it.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: Diet if you can but [REDACTED] um definitely you know and if you do develop diabetes it'll be very bad for your heart.
