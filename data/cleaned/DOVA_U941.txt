PATIENT: I don't know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah standing but you [REDACTED] in June I don't know is this right, in June of 2000 well you were 172.
PATIENT: When I came here, I came here in June.
DOCTOR: Cause you were working.
PATIENT: No I wasn't.  I came here from Puerto Rico cause I was dying and they sent me for treatment.
DOCTOR: Here from alcohol.
PATIENT: Alcohol.
DOCTOR: Is that why your weight was so low cause you weren't eating?
PATIENT: Oh it was no.  I drink and I did not eat nothing for weeks.
DOCTOR: Yeah look at how much your weight went up.  Your weight went up from you were 172 and then you went up to 215 and then you kind of were stable so hopefully when you start working again your weight will come down.
PATIENT: Cause I need to work over there [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: There are 25 acres.
DOCTOR: Well that's fantastic so I'm very happy that.  So how long can you stay in Cook Manor for?

DOCTOR: Oh great so you have some time to get some money built up, get an apartment, two years.  Do you mind if I take a look at you?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah let me take a peak.  I'm gonna wash my hands.
PATIENT: Now I want to see, I don't know if it was you or the other doctor.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I have, my feet were sweating big time.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And he said that was cause I was taking the high blood pressure pills and he gave me some water pills and they helped.
DOCTOR: I don't know how are your feet?
PATIENT: I take a the pills and I continue to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And to be honest with you, he gave me like a 25 mg pill to have me take half pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah, right.
PATIENT: I've been taking the whole pill.
DOCTOR: Okay fine.
PATIENT: Because it is so tiny.
DOCTOR: Well your blood pressure, it's not for your blood pressure control.  Your blood pressure's good.
PATIENT: Well the only thing that I am always concerned, being my concern is besides the high blood pressure is the heart [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: I know, when I came to the states.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I used to have 120, 145.
DOCTOR: So that can be due to the alcohol.  People that have alcohol they can go into withdrawals or when they're drinking can get heart rates that are fast and I know that you were drinking and not drinking and your body was probably.  Did you used to get the shakes a lot?
PATIENT: I know, it's gone.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But when you see me, when I came here uh.
DOCTOR: You were clean when I saw you in November.
PATIENT: I was.
DOCTOR: Yeah you told me.
PATIENT: I was clean from drugs.
DOCTOR: You told me you would drink a little bit in Puerto Rico, that's why you left.
PATIENT: Uh that was bullshit, I was drinking lots.
DOCTOR: Oh I knew.  Don't worry, [REDACTED] its okay.  Keep breathing.
PATIENT: As a matter of fact when you see me in the last time in November I was stop drinking for one day and I was shaking, my hand was shaking cause I was.
DOCTOR: Well I was trying to figure out why you left Puerto Rico, you came all the way up here just to see me, I didn't think I was that important so I was trying to figure out why you came here and left your family and I know you say that you can get a better job here so I think that that's fantastic but I know also you said that.  You go to the bathroom okay?  Well you told me that if you stayed around Puerto Rico you'd get in trouble.  You know you told me you were hanging out with the wrong guys and that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Your legs look good, they look real good.  There's no swelling at all.  Um so I think you're doing fantastic.  I'm very glad that uh you were able to get a job and you were able to get somewhere to live.  I applaud you for stopping alcohol and drugs.  I think that whatever you have to do to stay away from it do it.  I think that your health will get better as you start working more.  You will feel more motivated.  You'll have a real reason to get up in the morning and after a while you'll feel more empowered and you'll have more money and you can get an apartment and then you know hopefully you can get back with your family and get everything the way you want it again.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I'm applying for some job here in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Good.  Apply for everything you know we can do for you.
PATIENT: Yeah I get that job for [REDACTED] you know.
DOCTOR: Hey anything, any extra money is helpful.  It'll help you get back on your feet and help you get out of here.  And just keep the colonoscopy appointment.  Uh I don't think we're gonna change any medications today and it looks like you have DOCTOR in May, early May he's gonna see you.  So let me go, I'll talk to my boss but I like the way everything's going.  I'm going to see you in the summer.
