So uh looks like you've had a fever, cough, and a um and a headache that's gotten worse in the past four days and your headache's pretty bad, a seven out of ten. Um and uh it could be that you have uh some sort of an infection, uh including um, with Covid being one of the possibilities, and so um continue to take Tylenol and and um monitor your uh fever. If it continues to get worse, or you um notice that your symptoms are just not getting better, um you should come back, you should uh, we'll also do a Covid, we'll also send in a request for a Covid swab. Um and uh we'll ask you to quarantine for the for the next 14 days and try to stay away from your husband and daughter as well, if you can at home. Um and uh I guess a couple of other questions that I wanted to ask and I should have asked earlier, do you have any um any stiffness in your neck or any difficulties moving your neck?
PATIENT: Uh no, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: OK alright, and um do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Uh No, that's it. Thank you so much.
