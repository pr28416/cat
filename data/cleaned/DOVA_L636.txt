DOCTOR: Not too bad.  Want to come on back?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: So you never know what you're going to find when you open up the door.
DOCTOR: Let me carry that for you.
PATIENT: You know I didn't get the MRI.
DOCTOR: How come?
PATIENT: Because I'm claustrophobic.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I brought the medicine - Valium.
DOCTOR: Did you try the Valium?
PATIENT: No I didn't take it cause I couldn't even get in there.  I had a cold now.  I've got a cold now and that's the biggest problem I have when I'm laying down, due to my back or it's the postnasal drip and it makes me gag.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that's my nightmare yeah.  And I'm sorry but you know.
DOCTOR: No and so we'll do something.  We'll figure this out.
PATIENT: Okay.  I brought you back the pill too cause I didn't take it.  I don't know if they want it, so I probably should give it back to the pharmacy or.
DOCTOR: Um yeah I can do that.
PATIENT: Oh good, okay.  Yeah I bet they can use it.  I didn't even open it doc you know.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] okay.  But you got a cold [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah I've got a cold for a couple weeks now and um yeah.  You know cold sneezes so that and um my biggest problem lately is I uh fell out of bed twice in the last month and last night, night before last I fell out of the bed, a queen-sized bed and uh I sat up and my daughter's telling me that cause she is in the living room and I sat up and as soon as I sat up, I went right out of the bed in between the dresser and the night stand right.  Blasted my arm you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I blastered the arm real good and I bump my head on the dresser and I didn't pass out but I was soaking wet with sweat and the last time I had that happen to me, Stuckie woke me up because I was having a nightmare and I was holding my breath again and uh she went to shake me to wake me up and I jumped out of bed and fell right down again.  So I'm having that fall thing going on.
DOCTOR: How often are you waking up at night?
PATIENT: A lot.
DOCTOR: At nighttime?
PATIENT: Yes, the medicine I'm getting ain't helping me.  You know I had a real bad one you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: A couple real scary ones.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They don't scare me as much as they scare my wife and my daughter you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I look like kind of a mad man.  My daughter said you look like a mad man this morning you know.  My eyes are this big you know.  You know I'm embarrassed because she came in, she seen me with the diaper on and you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She's 17 you know I.  We don't even tell the kids I put them on you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But I had that on and that's been a real bummer too.  The wetting the bed and the constipation God I got some stuff, what do you call it, the enemas you know the liquid enemas that come in a squeeze bottle, she had to go out yesterday and get me that because I couldn't make it go and then that helped it like a great deal but then I'm bleeding.
DOCTOR: You're having bleeding?
PATIENT: My hemorrhoids.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: I was bleeding like a dog and uh it was terrible so.  Yeah I think I'm taking so much medicines I just think that's adding to it.  But I am putting weight back on.  I go to my cardiac exercise and now I'm on the next 12 week thing.
DOCTOR: Well good.
PATIENT: I got my 70% from the VA on my pension.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But they rated me 70% so I'm going to file the appeal and get the other 30 cause they said the only thing that they were lacking was being able to substantiate that I'm unemployable.  Well I'm on Social Security for being unemployable and disabled and I been telling the nurse that I'm unemployable by the psychiatrist DOCTOR and by another doctor here but they said they have to have more evidence so I don't know what evidence they need.
DOCTOR: When was the last time you saw DOCTOR?
PATIENT: Oh I seen him about two weeks ago I think.  I think I have to see him this week coming.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  Do you talk about [REDACTED] nighttime?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do [REDACTED] helping at all?
PATIENT: No, really I mean.  He got me on this medication and you know, like I'll tell him I'm falling out of bed and he'll tell me well move the night stand and throw a couple comforters down on the floor next to your bed, so we do that.  So I [REDACTED] it's insane.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know its insane man.  So the heart, the surgery, it’s good.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I [REDACTED] neck and low back you know.  But uh that was tough because of the loss of weight you know.  Cause I've lost a lot of weight and I look like it too.
DOCTOR: You look better than when I saw you last.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I've done good now you know.  I'm starting to, you know put on the weight now.  I'm about 164, 165.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: But I'm working out so.  At the Cardiac Rehab.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I'm just beside myself about this waking up at night you know and wetting the bed and you know and not having any control over these nightmares you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  They say wetting the bed [REDACTED] through the diapers?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I slowed down on drinking.  My wife tells me no you can't do that, you'll screw your kidneys up and.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] slow down drinking water?
PATIENT: Water, yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no, no. I had a couple drinks last month and I got uh some medicine from the psychiatrist to take if I feel like I'm going to start having a problem.  I can't think of the name of it now.  Uh, Antabuse.
DOCTOR: It's Antabuse yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah so.  But I was really depressed after a while.  My dad's funeral.
DOCTOR: Are you having neck pain?
PATIENT: Yeah I'm having some neck pain, back of my neck.  When I wake up in the mornings uh cause that's what I do is I try to sleep high.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And when I’m sleeping high I'm doing this at night and I wake up with a really pounding headache and uh I don't think it's anything to do with any damage from my body just the way that I sleep and uh that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Of course I'm making my wife crazy cause she's watching me now.  I went for the sleep apnea test.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And the nurse told me I held my breath three times during the evening.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Well she said one of them was 40 seconds long.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Then they woke me up about 10 to 5 on that one.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And they tried to give me that little mask that you wear.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I couldn't wear it.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Neither one.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: So then they let me go home and she says DOCTOR will call me and let me know about that.  I hadn't heard from DOCTOR.  Maybe she went on vacation or something.  That Korean doctor so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah so I don't know if we need a follow up on that.  [REDACTED] thing is I even hold my breath during the day she notices.  I don't know what that's from.  Your guess is as good as mine.
DOCTOR: Well, it's [REDACTED] sleep apnea.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um [REDACTED] works as [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: But for people like, like you and me and I have it as well.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: And uh I don't know why.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's not gonna kill you, let's put it that way.
DOCTOR: Well you know, the problem is that holding your breath while you sleep and struggling against holding your breath.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It can put a strain on your heart and your lungs.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Because you're creating high pressure inside your chest.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that straining can cause some damage.
PATIENT: It does.
DOCTOR: Yeah to the heart.
PATIENT: Could it have cause that tumor?
DOCTOR: It wouldn't cause a tumor but it can weaken the heart.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Quite a bit.
PATIENT: Then I got to do something about that then.
DOCTOR: So part of it is finding a CPAP machine that you like.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Sort of finding a position where you sleep and don't hold your breath.  Are you going to see the pulmonologist again, have they reviewed that sleep study?
PATIENT: I hope so.  I don't know, who's it gonna be?
DOCTOR: There's one um. (Looks in EMR)
PATIENT: Cause I want to get this taken care of cause I you know my heart took a beating with that surgery you know.  I ended up with a bad heart you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So it said the test will be read by DOCTOR by [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It’s Friday.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  You may need to give DOCTOR a call.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.  Do you have a direct line to her? Where is she at, what medicine?
DOCTOR: She's uh; She's in pulmonology.  [REDACTED]  You could call the main line and ask for the Sleep Clinic.
PATIENT: Okay.  Yeah.  What floor was that on 11 or something like that?  I don't even remember when I went up there.  I think it was up there, 14, 11, I don't know.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] to get it.  Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Still something to get.  So you had an MRI in the past.  How did you get through the MRI?
PATIENT: Well I didn't have this thing because I took the medication for a couple days before that and it wasn't a long trip into that machine.  It was kind of fast.  I think I was in there maybe 15 minutes if that but I know I wanted to come out of there every second I was in there you know.  I just told myself to stay there and get this done.  But it's a real bummer for me.  You know I can't stand being in there.  [REDACTED] not good.  You know not good.  And I feel like the guy can't hear me you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I'm scared of it you know.  Not to be a sissy about it,
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It scared the shit out of me.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You know.  I been in a couple situations where I was in that [REDACTED], it was like so if we can do the same thing that SCT scan will give you, you know if that'll work or if you could knock me out.
DOCTOR: Yeah we may have to.  I don't know.  Let's see, let me ask DOCTOR, [REDACTED].  Mind if I take a quick listen to you?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I'll take this shirt off for you.
DOCTOR: Yeah sure.

PATIENT: Okay doctor.
DOCTOR: Take a couple of deep breaths.  Okay.  Any pain here?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Turn your head again [REDACTED].  Does that feel weak at all?
