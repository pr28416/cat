PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So they used to have you on uh two pills.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then I guess they took one of them off probably because you were low and you were dizzy too.  But, if you're, if it's really this high again I might have to start a new one.  Just relax your arm, relax it.  Cause actually that hydrochlorothiazide they now have a combo pill so I can give you one now that has a combination of two so, maybe that's a good option.  Okay.
