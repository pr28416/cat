DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: How are you?  I'm DOCTOR, nice to meet you.
PATIENT: Nice meeting you doctor.
DOCTOR: Come on in.  So how you doing today?
PATIENT: You know not too bad for an older gentleman.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You're not that old, 73's not that bad.
PATIENT: No that's right, that's not bad.
DOCTOR: So I am, you previously saw DOCTOR is that right?
PATIENT: That's right.
DOCTOR: So I am the new DOCTOR.  So I took a look through your chart so it sounds like you were recently seen like in September in the Acute Care Clinic for some complaints of worsening shortness of breath and stuff like that.
PATIENT: Yeah and the COPD.
DOCTOR: So they sent you to the Pulmonary Clinic and you saw DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: He did the PFT test, he did a blood test.  Sounds like um, you know you have a little bit, what's known as moderate to severe you know COPD and um sounds like that at that time he thought that you are on the right medications and the best thing to do would just to be to exercise and he was contributing some of the symptoms to the deconditioning it sounds like.  Is that what he told you?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So how have you felt like since?
PATIENT: Well you know, he told me that I could use some of that inhaler more than I was originally told.
DOCTOR: Which one?
PATIENT: Uh, the Combivent.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that I only need to use more often occasionally uh.  For the most part, it's, it's been fine I take the, I take so damn much medicine, the formoterol.
DOCTOR: Formoterol.
PATIENT: And then the Asmanex in the morning.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that seems to bring me right through the evening when I take the formoterol again and that seems to be.
DOCTOR: Seems to be good?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay so you're feeling better than you were before.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But uh, as far as the uh exercise uh, my wife and I used to do a lot of walking in the Forest Reserves until the weather got crappy.
DOCTOR: Right.  Did you used to do that like recently or in the distant past?
PATIENT: Oh recently up until you know the start of the fall when the weather started getting bad.  She drags me out to the mall a couple times a month.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So you usually walk with your wife during the summer months but in the winter and fall you don't exercise as much.
PATIENT: Uh in the fall if the weather's nice we go.  You know if it's decent.  In the winter I.
DOCTOR: But it's a just an important thing to do.  You don't belong to a gym do you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Um you now uh the YMCA or even just walking outside for you know a half an hour to an hour every day would be a good thing.  Um it sounds like you know your COPD is kind of where it is and the best thing that we can do to help that is give you the medications that we're giving you now, but also you need to optimize your health.  So you know to lose a little weight and continue to exercise is all good for lung function and can helped you feel better and things like that so.  Uh I would definitely recommend that.
PATIENT: Now we do have uh a Recreation Center in the Village.
DOCTOR: Good.  Do they have like a track or like a treadmill or something?
PATIENT: They got a nice walking track there.  It all goes around the basketball court.  You know I was talking to them and because of my a fib I could actually.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: They said they needed a letter from a doctor, my doctor.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Before they could give me a membership.
DOCTOR: Oh clearance.  You need a letter from me?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Sure okay.  Uh and how have you been feeling otherwise?
PATIENT: You know really pretty good.  Like DOCTOR says we're holding you together pretty well aren't we?
DOCTOR: Yeah, sounds like it.  I mean you had the one episode of the COPD uh which you know wasn't too bad.  Uh so you have uh, you've been seen in the past with um some shortness of breath and things like that in the ER right?
PATIENT: Um yes.
DOCTOR: But you haven't had any episodes of shortness of breath or chest pain or edema or anything like that.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You have the a fib right?
PATIENT: That's correct.
DOCTOR: And you're on what medications for that?
PATIENT: Coumadin.
DOCTOR: Coumadin.  And you're on metoprolol and tramadol.
PATIENT: And tramadol, Digoxin, diltiazem.
DOCTOR: You're on diltiazem as well?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  You had one hospitalization where they had to change your diltiazem right, in the past.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But now it's okay.
PATIENT: Now I'm on lisinopril also.
DOCTOR: For your high blood pressure.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay and then uh high cholesterol you're on the simvastatin right?
PATIENT: That's correct.
DOCTOR: And the niacin, still take that?
PATIENT: That's correct.
DOCTOR: And I think your last numbers were pretty good, really good actually.  They were in; do you know when your last round was? I’ll tell you. It was July.
PATIENT: Yeah when they took the fasting blood test?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So that's pretty good, so I'd keep those kind of where they are.  Um so the diabetes is what we need to talk about today.  How you been doing with that?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: How's your diet been?
PATIENT: My diet.  My problem doctor, is.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm a potato eater.
DOCTOR: That all takes potato signs.
PATIENT: Yes.  My mother and father were from Belgium and they went through the First World War and German invasion.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Where they ate a lot of potatoes because that's all they had.
DOCTOR: They'd eat a lot of carbs and cheeses and all that kind of stuff.
PATIENT: Yeah and it kind of carried down into us.
DOCTOR: How long has your diet been bad, forever?  Have you ever been able to uh kind of get that under check at all or not really?
PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: So pretty much almost most of the time.
PATIENT: When I was working I was able to keep my weight reasonably in the high 190s or low 200s and if and you’re going to say if I would say if you would get out and walk you'd probably lose some weight.
DOCTOR: A little bit.  What did you do for a living?
PATIENT: I was a commercial salesman for Overhead Doors.
DOCTOR: Okay so you were out walking around a lot.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: When did you retire?
PATIENT: Oh it's been eight years.
DOCTOR: So we have a program here called the MOVE Program, have you heard of that before?
PATIENT: Uh I don't believe so.
DOCTOR: It's uh an active way to help veterans lose weight and programs and things like that.  Would you be interested in maybe doing something like that?  At least to assess you and just see ways we could help lose weight.
PATIENT: Um how often does it, I mean that probably requires coming in to the clinic.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Yeah.  Coming to the class, I'm not really sure where the classes are.  I've heard good things from other veterans.  Some people like it, some people don’t, it's a personal preference.  The other thing I would recommend is to see the nutritionist too um to see if we can't work on some other healthy choices or ways that the foods that you like are also healthy for you.  So those are the two things that I recommend that you do and then I'll write the letter for the gym and I definitely think exercise is number one.  Number one and number two diet control and exercising.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I say this because you're last hemoglobin A1c, do you know what that is?
PATIENT: I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: That's what measures, so that's what measures your sugar over a three month period.  It's really good at giving us an idea of how you're dealing with the control of your diabetes.  Previously so we want that number below 7 and you probably below 6.5.  7 is kind of the cut-off.  You were 7.5 last November, this time last year.  In May you were 8.8, so you were up more than a point.  So you were poorly controlled on your diabetes.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: What have your sugars been like?  Do you check them?
PATIENT: Oh like every other day you know.
DOCTOR: And what have they been?
PATIENT: Most of the time below 100s you know.  I'd say ranging between 98 and 120.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do they ever get high?  When do you check them?
PATIENT: In the morning.
DOCTOR: Do you ever check them at night?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: And they never get really higher than that?
PATIENT: Uh, oh they have occasionally yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Recently?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: So I mean you should be, you should be cause this number, this 8.5 number, 8.5 number is bad um and you're heading in the wrong direction.  We need to recheck it to make sure that it's pretty under [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: You should check them in the morning and you should check them at night to give us an idea of what.
PATIENT: Okay.  There is another problems with doing that.
DOCTOR: What's that?
PATIENT: Is the Pharmacy, their directions are that I check it every other day and if I run out of the test strips.
DOCTOR: I can order some more.  I can always order you more test strips and I will today.  Do you get the test strips from us?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um so, you're on metformin right?
PATIENT: Shoot that by me again?
DOCTOR: The medication that you're on, the metformin for the diabetes, do you take that?
PATIENT: Uh, is that the same as glipizide?
DOCTOR: Nope.
PATIENT: I'm taking glipizide.
DOCTOR: You're taking glipizide 10 but you're not taking the metformin?
PATIENT: I.
DOCTOR: You were in the past.
PATIENT: Don't have a prescription for it.
DOCTOR: So you're not on metformin, I'll see what else, so you're only controlled with the glipizide is that right?
PATIENT: That's correct.
DOCTOR: (Doctor answers a phone call)  Okay.  So I'm sorry uh where were we at?
PATIENT: Uh the diabetes medications.
DOCTOR: Yeah so, so you were not on the metformin in the past cause you have some baseline kidney disease right?
PATIENT: Oh yeah some damage to the kidneys from the high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Right so uh you've been on the glipizide um 10 mg every day is that right?
PATIENT: That's correct.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And your A1c was getting better last time DOCTOR saw you.  You saw him about a year ago right?
PATIENT: Oh no, was it that long ago?
DOCTOR: Well let me see, one second.  DOCTOR, no he saw you in May.  Okay so um yeah and he talked about it then and we're going to talk about it again now is that the only concern is that the next step is to do insulin, giving yourself shots.  I know you're not thrilled about it.
PATIENT: I hate needles.  I've had so damn many needles stuck in me over the years.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I just hate them.
DOCTOR: So, so there's a couple ways of doing this um, so we can go right to the insulin or we can do diet and I'm talking strict diet control.  You know lose.  How much do you weigh right now?
PATIENT: Uh 229.
DOCTOR: 226 and how tall are you?
PATIENT: Uh just a shade under 6 foot, like 5' 11 1/2.
DOCTOR: So you should be, your ideal body weight is more in the 180 range.
PATIENT: 185?
DOCTOR: Yep so uh I mean you need to lose at least 20-30 pounds.  Which is, a lot, but I mean I'm talking ideally you need to lose at least 10 pounds, we need to get you exercising and you need to control your diet better um because I'm just, you know, I'm concerned.  You know, at your age diabetes can have, it can kind of wreak havoc on your body and with already the history of the atrial fibrillation that you have and already the history of COPD, you know these problems tend to mount up and this is one that we can definitely control.  But I think with some you know lifestyle modification, with some better diet, with some more exercise.  Uh maybe with one more pill uh that we take for diabetes uh we could better control this.  But I'm worried that you know that you went up that much.  It just shows that your diabetes is not as well controlled as we'd like and I think you would admitted that you're diet has been not as well right?
PATIENT: That's right.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I wo admit that.
DOCTOR: So what do you think about that?  Do you think that's a reasonable goal?
PATIENT: Yeah if it's going to make me feel better and add a few years to my life.
DOCTOR: Yeah absolutely.
PATIENT: I've got.
DOCTOR: Cause diabetes is just a tough disease and can cause a lot of problems but I think you know something that you can control but um we got to be proactive about it.  But aside from that um, you had an adrenalectomy for that [REDACTED] right?  They took that off?
PATIENT: Of the adrenal gland, yeah.
DOCTOR: And you have oh you have sleep apnea right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Um do you use the CPAP?
PATIENT: I do.
DOCTOR: Okay how's that working, better?
PATIENT: Well, yeah it took a long time to get used to.
DOCTOR: Yeah, no I'm sure it's a lot, but you're using it now?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Good, well that's good.
PATIENT: Except when I go to see my grandchildren in northern Wisconsin.  I don't drag that thing around with me.
DOCTOR: How long did you go up there for?
PATIENT: Uh we usually only go for a weekend, three days.
DOCTOR: I see.  Well as long as you're using it uh you know by and large most of the time, you know I'm happy with that.  That's [REDACTED].  Um let's see what else, so you have uh, you had a stroke in the past right?
PATIENT: Yeah a very mild one.
DOCTOR: And do you ever monitor your blood pressures at home?
PATIENT: Yes I do, yeah.
DOCTOR: What are they typically?
PATIENT: Uh you know normally they're uh, I guess it depends on the medication affects this.  Sometimes it's uh you know as low as 64/80 you know uh.  Sometimes it's you know 130/85 or something like that.
DOCTOR: But yeah, in the clinic here it's been pretty well controlled um so I'm happy with that.  We'll keep you on those medications.  And you have the low back pain from a disk herniation right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: How's that been doing?
PATIENT: Uh alright, yeah it's, the different things I do bother it yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: My wife works part-time so I do, so I keep up with some of the housework for her and one of the worst things that just standing at the sink and doing the damn dishes.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: And it'll start to hurt and I think that's fairly sedentary activity, why should it bother me?
DOCTOR: Well, so you notice it more when you're standing for a long period of time or just when you're doing the dishes?
PATIENT: Well, mostly with those kind of activities.  You know when I'm walking it doesn't bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh, it's kind of crazy.  I just never know when it's going to act up.
DOCTOR: You never know, it just comes and goes.  What do you do when you have the pain?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medication?
PATIENT: But I'm cheap.
DOCTOR: Pretty cheap.  Do you take any Tylenol or anything like that?
PATIENT: Uh no I don't.  Like I say because I feel I take so damn much medications to begin with, I don't need anything more.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um and then um have we ever done an abdominal ultrasound on you, do you know?
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Because typically over the age of 65, people that have smoked in the past uh deserve a abdominal ultrasound just to check for a aortic aneurysm.  It's kind of a routine screening.
PATIENT: Huh, no I've never had one.
DOCTOR: Well you had a CT scan of your thigh and shoulder in 2005 and it didn’t show any abnormalities, so I think we're probably okay.  Uh and then kind of health maintenance, do that the last colonoscopy was in 2004, it was normal.  Um you're last PSA was totally normal and that was in 2008, probably could recheck that.  Um so we'll do the colonoscopy in 2014, I think that’s the next one, ten years.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um you got the flu vaccine I saw in October.  You don't smoke anymore, you used to right?
PATIENT: Uh yes, used to be a fairly heavy smoker.
DOCTOR: A pack and a half a day for 40 years, that's what I saw in there, is that right?
PATIENT: Uh a pack and a half a day for 40 years would be.
DOCTOR: Fair?
PATIENT: Would be fair to say.
DOCTOR: And then uh do you drink alcohol anymore?
PATIENT: Um, a glass of wine occasionally.  When someone offers me a real good scotch I don't turn that down but that's about.
DOCTOR: So just socially okay.  Uh do you have any depression at all?  Do you ever get sad or anything.  Thoughts of you know, do you decreased energy or not sleeping well or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, uh uh.
DOCTOR: Not really.
PATIENT: I got a bunch of grandkids and three great grandkids, they kind of keep my, like I said they kind of keep my [REDACTED].  And that just keeps your spirits up.
DOCTOR: Sure.  So you have some symptoms of urinary, I'm assuming hesitancy and you had some dribbling and things like that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you're on the terazosin now, better with that?
PATIENT: Yep.  I still pee an awful lot.
DOCTOR: You will.  Do you get up at night to urinate a lot?
PATIENT: Um yeah.  I usually go to bed between 10:30-11:00 o'clock and between 2 and 3 I'll be up to go and then I'll be up again around 6 to go, then I usually just stay up.  I'm up at 6 o'clock.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let's see um and we're going to do a hemoglobin A1c today.  Uh did they give you information about that Advanced Directive?  In the event that you were to become unconscious or unable to make a medical decision, who would make the decision for you?  Did they give you information about that in the past?
PATIENT: Oh I have a Living Will on file here yes.
DOCTOR: You do.
PATIENT: No extreme measures.
DOCTOR: Um do you take any non-VA medications that we don't give you?
PATIENT: No.  Oh excuse me, other than an aspirin a day, children's aspirin a day.
DOCTOR: So you take a baby aspirin now.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright so what medications do you need refilled today?
PATIENT: Uh I need.
DOCTOR: I have you on the Combivent inhaler you have nine refills of that.  The albuterol rescue inhaler you have seven refills of that.
PATIENT: Yeah which I don't use the albuterol very often.
DOCTOR: How about the Digoxin?  I have that you only have one refill of that.  Do you want me to refill that one?
PATIENT: Yes and uh you know doctor I could use, if I could pick it up today, the metoprolol I probably got.
DOCTOR: Do you want to pick all this stuff up today or would you rather have most of it mailed and just pick up the metoprolol, whatever you'd like.
PATIENT: Uh the only thing I'm low on.
DOCTOR: Low on is the metoprolol.  Alright so I'll send everything else uh and uh the diltiazem you need a refill on that.  Uh formoterol, you've been on that.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So you pretty much need most of the stuff.
PATIENT: You know the formoterol I just opened the new box today and I've got at least one box sitting in there besides.
DOCTOR: And the Lasix, do you still take two tablets every morning and one at night?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: 40 in the morning and 20 at night.  And uh the lisinopril you have no refills and you take that every day right?  One mg every day?
PATIENT: Yeah uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then the metoprolol, let's see we'll have you pick that up at the window.  You take 12.5 twice a day right?
PATIENT: That's correct, half tablet twice a day.
DOCTOR: That'll be ready for you to pick up at the window today.  Mometasone you have a lot of refills on, do you have enough of that?
PATIENT: The.
DOCTOR: The mometasone?  That's one of the other inhaler.
PATIENT: Is that Asmanex, is it the same thing?
DOCTOR: Hmm, let me check I'm not sure.  How many inhalers do you typically take every day?
PATIENT: Every day?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I take the Asmanex, formoterol.
DOCTOR: The Asmanex is the mometasone.
PATIENT: And the Combivent.
DOCTOR: So do you need more of that or are you good on refills right now?
PATIENT: Uh I'm fine on the inhalers yeah.
DOCTOR: The mometasone okay.  The niacin I'll refill that and then the statin, you still take the statin drug right?
PATIENT: Yes, yeah that one.
DOCTOR: And the terazosin you take that as well and the Coumadin did they refill that for you?
PATIENT: Yes they do.
DOCTOR: Uh the glipizide.  Alright um let's see so every thing has been done here.  Anything else uh bothering you or things I should know about?
PATIENT: Uh no I was just at the Eye Clinic and I have the onset of glaucoma.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What are they doing with that?
PATIENT: Uh well they're going to see me in another couple months and uh see how; you know how much it's progressed.  It's a very slow progressing disease so I look at it, I'll probably be dead before I'm blind.
DOCTOR: That’s a way to look at it. So um any headaches or vision changes at all, aside from the kind of the glaucoma symptoms.
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: Uh trouble swallowing, unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Um shortness of breath more than normal?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Chest pain, palpitations, anything like that?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Um do you have any abdominal pain at all, nausea, vomiting?
PATIENT: No.  Although I don't know if it's significant uh sometimes I have a helluva time with my bowel movements.
DOCTOR: Do you have some constipation?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you ever take any stool softeners at all?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Want to try one?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: If it'll help me go.
DOCTOR: It will.  Okay uh any cramping in your legs when you walk?
PATIENT: No, a lot of cramps at night when I sleep.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Because the damn cat takes up most of the bed.
DOCTOR: Oh really.  When was your last, alright uh have a seat up here.  No lumps or bumps in your neck that you notice?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Can you take your glasses off for me?  Look right at my nose.  Follow my light with your eyes, don't move your head.  Stick your tongue out and say ah for me.
PATIENT: Ah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay.  Put your hand against my hand like this, [REDACTED].  Shrug your shoulders up for me.  Smile like this.  Turn your head and cough.  Can you wrinkle your forehead like this?  Stick your tongue out like this.  Good.  Any trouble hearing at all?
PATIENT: No.  Although my wife.
DOCTOR: Selective hearing loss?
PATIENT: That's the likely theory.
DOCTOR: There you go.  Unfortunately we can't treat that much to her chagrin I'm sure.  Okay.  Can you lift your shirt up for me and I'll listen to your back here.  Deep breath.  Inhale and breathe out.  Relax.  Can you lay back for me?  I'm going to feel right there.  Any abdominal pain at all when I press there?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You can sit up now.  You're not holding up any water in your legs or anything.
PATIENT: I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: You're not holding up any water in your legs or anything?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You've had some edema in the past right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: But since that time, no problems okay.  Alright any other questions or concerns for me right now?
PATIENT: Um, none that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: We kind of went through everything.  Um well let me go talk with my attending really quick and I'll be right back after I see him okay.
PATIENT: Good to check.
DOCTOR: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  76:50  DOCTOR IN: 83:35)
DOCTOR: Hello.
PATIENT: Hi.
DOCTOR: I'm DOCTOR.
PATIENT: How are you doctor?
DOCTOR: I'm good.  So the only change I wanted to make was for your diabetes.  The last time we checked your diabetes test your A1c was quite high, about four months ago.  Have your blood sugars changed since the last test or have they been the same for a long time?
PATIENT: Uh, it's been fairly consistent.  I mean I don't check them as often as I should.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's what DOCTOR told me.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well you can go for some blood tests today and if it's still shows a high level we need to increase your medications.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay the other thing you could do is if you're a.m. the morning one is good, start checking different times of the day.  Maybe you could check it in the morning today before breakfast, check it before lunch on you know two days from now and then before dinner, then maybe two hours afternoon.  Make columns and write down your sugars when you check it so that way we'll know what time of the day is high.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Sometimes in the morning it will be good but it may be high later on in the day okay.
PATIENT: Understandable.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.
PATIENT: Thank you so much doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, so we kind of went over all your data um and the plan, I think is, so I'm going to put in a consult for that nutrition class.  I asked my attending about the MOVE class, you know the losing weight one and she said they meet once a month here.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh and I think it would be worthwhile at least to try it, maybe just to get you started into getting back in the working out mode um, we'll do the Nutrition consult and then we're going to do a PSA.  We're going to do some basic labs and we're going to also do that hemoglobin A1c today.  If that's elevated I'm going to increase your glipizide.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: To see.  I'd like to see you again in three months and when you come back I want you to do um a sugar diary so try to take it um every day and try to vary like DOCTOR was saying when you take it.  One day take it in the morning, one day take it before lunch and one day take it before you go to bed in the evening cause sometimes your sugars may be well controlled in the morning but maybe later on in the day they're not as well controlled and that's why.  Because the numbers that you're telling me right now like in the 120, the 90s-120s, don't correlate with the high hemoglobin A1c.  So I want to get another hemoglobin A1c just to make sure maybe that wasn't kind of a fluke thing and maybe it's a blood sugar [REDACTED] something whatever and then you know if it's up we'll change it, if not we'll leave it how it is, okay.  And then let me go get some letterhead and I'm going to write uh the letter for your gym so that you can, one second hold on here.  Now I'm going to get some letterhead so that we can do that.  Okay official VA letterhead.
PATIENT: Okay now does this diet mean no more lasagna?
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Cause I have two Italian sister-in-laws that are marvelous cooks.
DOCTOR: I'm sure they are, all Italians are.  You know that stuff is all, because you know any carbohydrate turns into sugar obviously in your body so.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um so I'm not saying no never but take what you're eating now and cut it in half.  Do you know what I mean?  Don't stop all the lasagna you ever eat completely but try to reduce it and see if, you know we'll see if that doesn't help.  But it's tough with the holidays, I understand that.
PATIENT: Well the strange thing about the holidays, the only thing I really like is the turkey and dressing which is bad for me and the cranberry sauce which is bad for me.  The turkey is good, the rest of the things I like are bad.
DOCTOR: So just that you were evaluated here and that you can exercise without any restrictions?
PATIENT: Yeah.  For their liability.
DOCTOR: And you never have had any chest pain or you know shortness of breathe with exertion or anything like that that you really notice?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay that's going to do it.  I'll put those consults in and I will also put in for you to pick up that metformin, not the metformin the metoprolol at the Pharmacy.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and I'd like to see you again in three months with um the diary of your sugars and how they've been doing and varying the times that you take them.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you run out of the test strips call me and I'll give you some more.  Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  Very good, then I should take this to the check out.
DOCTOR: Check out and uh see you in a couple of months.  Have a very good holiday.
PATIENT: Thank you, you too doctor.
DOCTOR: Very nice to meet you.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Oh, oh I forgot.  I need you to get those blood tests today.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: This is for you and I'll give you a hard copy.  You can get the labs drawn right up here.
PATIENT: I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: You can actually get the labs drawn right here.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So have a seat here and they'll call you when they're ready okay.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Very nice to meet you.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: I lied, they're not here right now, probably go downstairs.
PATIENT: I'll go downstairs.
DOCTOR: Just go downstairs okay.
