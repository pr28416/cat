PATIENT: I got it.
DOCTOR: Got it alright.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Ready.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Sorry for the wait.  Uh you came here a little bit early today and usually we're able to sort of squeeze you in sometime but we weren't able to do that today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But um so what brings you in here today?
PATIENT: Well I uh, somebody scheduled me an appointment and that's all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I can tell you what's wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright sounds good.
PATIENT: Um it's a little, little muscle there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It used to be the size of a football right here and now it's just like here right now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think the more I exercise the more it go down.
DOCTOR: Oh really.
PATIENT: See what happens, I come into the hospital and had a low blood count.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So they took a bone biopsy right here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That paralyzed me all the way down.  So I can't walk right now.  You know I got a walker at home and uh this knee here, where it's got a pin in it, it give me a lot of, it give me a lot of trouble right here in this knee.  It's giving me a lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: Uh when did you get the pin in it?
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: It's been a while?
PATIENT: About 7 years.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh you know the hip, see when I'm trying, like if I want to try to get from here to that desk.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: This will give me a problem and then my hip would give me a problem you know.
DOCTOR: And that's what limiting your abilty to move around?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  See what the uh, looks like, excuse me; you had been in rehab for a little while.
PATIENT: In what?
DOCTOR: They had been in rehab for a little while.
PATIENT: Yeah just a couple three times downstairs. Oh I got to ask you to get me reinstated for the rehab because they're calling me and when they call me I can't get to the phone so three calls they don't call me no more.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They told me I had to get you to reinstate me.
DOCTOR: Alright I can put in another consult for that.  Excuse me.  Um just about done, I need a drink of water real quick.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: To clear my throat.  (Doctor leaves for less than a minute to get some water).  I'm sorry about that.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright so.  Let's start with your, with your knee and your hip.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Then we can, we'll take a look at it again today and we'll make sure we get you back in place with physical therapy.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Uh what else has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh nothing I just kind of haven't had very much of an appetite but I'm gonna have to work on that you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, over what time period did that change?  How long have you noticed that your appetite's low.
PATIENT: Well every since I come here in the hospital.  The day I come into the hospital I couldn't eat when I was here.  I weighed 194 pounds and now I'm down to 164.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So uh when I left the hospital I weighed 174.  Since I've been home I haven't been eating but I got to make some more eating arrangements.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  Um so I think uh vitamin supplements to take would be a good idea.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And uh take in whatever you can.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um definitely good for keeping your energy level up.  Sometimes if you feel more energy you tend to eat more.  It's just kind of a, once it gets going it should help for.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Wanting you to feel like eating.  Um so it looks like if I'm reading everything correctly uh, so I read about your hospitalizations and the rehab.  So then you had a blood, like sort of a hematoma or a big bruise that developed after the biopsy is that what?
PATIENT: Well I don't know, you talking about this?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well actually this was like a football, way like this.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now it just back of my hand like this.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Yeah that was blood there and that's a good thing.  If that was muscle not as good of a thing so.
PATIENT: Yeah I don't know.
DOCTOR: I think it probably, from what it sounds like; it was a big hematoma or blood clot that formed there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And so then your body's slowly going to re-absorb that.
PATIENT: Right.  Cause you know since I been trying to get around, you know I been walking with two walking sticks.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I got a walker.  So uh I'm doing better.
DOCTOR: Okay good.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um and it looks like next week you have an appointment with the hematologist.
PATIENT: Next week [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh.
PATIENT: No, no, the GI tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Yeah the 13th.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um.  It looks like they want to follow up on some of what they got out of the biopsy.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Sound about right?
PATIENT: Yes, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let's see if I can find the report here.  Okay.
PATIENT: (Patient belches.) Excuse me.
DOCTOR: No problem.  Alright.  So other than the uh pain in your hip and your knee um is there any other thing that's bothered you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  Have you been feeling like dizzy when you stand up, that sort of thing?
PATIENT: No I was feeling woozy today because I haven't eaten nothing too much.  I ate half of a cheese sandwich, cheese grilled cheese and I ate a honey bun a while ago.  I think and I didn't take all my blood pressure medicines.  But otherwise than that, I been alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm just going to write a few of these things out so I don't forget.  Uh.
PATIENT: I need an appointment with the foot specialists.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you seen them?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: You need to see the foot specialists?
PATIENT: Yeah because it's like a bunion like.
DOCTOR: Bunion okay.  I'll take a look at it and I'll also uh we can get you in to see them pretty easily.
PATIENT: Alright.

PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright, letâ€™s continue here.  You haven't had any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  Alright take a couple deep breaths there.  Is there any movements that make this hip pain worse?
PATIENT: No it just.
DOCTOR: Just when you're weight [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Trying to walk yeah.  No I don't have no pain, just when I try to walk, you know you can feel it and all this, you know is numb like.  I got feelings; see now like if you didn't have no feelings and the feeling come back in it, well that's its like.

I got to talk to the boss um and uh we'll get you back to therapy and make sure all your medications are up-to-date and uh I think that'll probably about do you for now, so I'll run everything by him and I'll be back in a little bit.
PATIENT: Alright, alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  153:4  DOCTOR IN:  170:29)
DOCTOR: Sorry about the wait.
PATIENT: It's alright.
DOCTOR: I had to wade through a lot of your records uh with the boss.  Um but I think we have a pretty good plan.  Your blood pressure is still a little bit elevated today so we're gonna start you on a low dose of lisinopril.  We're going to start you on lisinopril um furosemide or Lasix.
PATIENT: I got enough high blood pressure medicine, I just didn't take it.

PATIENT: I did but that was after I was on my way here.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you didn't have all your medications today.
PATIENT: No I grabbed the one, I ate half of a sandwich and I took that medication in the car.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright well that makes me feel a little bit better about where things are.
