DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How are you?  Hey.
PATIENT: Hi.

DOCTOR: I did.  I [REDACTED] get-a-way.
PATIENT: Yeah I just saw you.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah I just came in.  Uh how you doing?
PATIENT: Oh pretty good.  What's that, is that a birthmark on your leg?
DOCTOR: Where?
PATIENT: Right there.
DOCTOR: No I get it from you know when I cross my legs.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: It's like  bruise, it really never goes away.
PATIENT: Really.  That's all.
DOCTOR: It never completely goes away.
PATIENT: I was gonna ask you if that's a birthmark.
DOCTOR: No I hate it though but if you look right where I cross my legs, it's exactly there.
PATIENT: And it's there forever?
DOCTOR: There forever and I feel like.
PATIENT: Yeah cause that's a habit of yours.
DOCTOR: I know, I know I try not to but, what are you gonna do right.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Uh I'm DOCTOR.  I think you normally see um DOCTOR.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: He is on call today so he's not going to be here, so I'm filling in for him.  How you doing?
PATIENT: Pretty good.
DOCTOR: Looks like you were just here about a month ago.
PATIENT: Yeah, same thing.  Well it is the same thing that I want to tell you about.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I got kind of like a virus and they've been watching it because of my condition.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] lungs.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] yeah.
PATIENT: I've been through a lot.
DOCTOR: You sure have.  So you're not [REDACTED] at all.
PATIENT: I think I caught, I got wet about three weeks ago in the rain.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: And uh I all this was gone, coughing, sneezing everything was gone and they all came back.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And now I hurt, I'm not hurting now.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But when the pain starts you know in this area over here, it hurts and I have to drop a Vicodin and uh my stomach, I been having a lot of problems down in my stomach, I’ve been seen by the GI.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But uh they said, it's too dangerous to be putting that scope down there.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But something’s got to be done cause this stomach irritates me every day but I think I caught a virus because it's always growling.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Making noises.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: And I got diarrhea and had it for two weeks.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's not diarrhea, diarrhea but it's not normal.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: And they got me on Maalox but I just changed from the [REDACTED] you know my physical lung therapy.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And they said that Maalox will give you irregular bowel movements.
DOCTOR: Let's do this, let’s try to go off the Maalox okay.
PATIENT: Oh, what do we do about the pain?
DOCTOR: Well Maalox, so we can do, you're on a PPI twice a day right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Try just doing that, at least until the diarrhea subsides cause I don't know if this pain is coming from your lung [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I'm gonna lose weight by having this diarrhea.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah and I think you have to pick which one's worse but I think I don't need you having diarrhea and losing a lot of weight you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I just keep up that way you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
PATIENT: As sick as I was [REDACTED] and I don't want to lose it back.
DOCTOR: No, no, no.  So let's go off the Maalox, at least back off to every other day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And see if that helps you at all.  Um you're taking.
PATIENT: I forgot, it start with a O.
DOCTOR: Um omeprazole.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And you're taking twice a day right?  [REDACTED] go easy on that, that'll help protect your stomach and then the 5 of Maalox back off to twice a day.  You're not taking the [REDACTED] or the Docusate are you?
PATIENT: What is that?
DOCTOR: There's two medications that are stool softeners, you're not taking them?
PATIENT: Oh no, no.
DOCTOR: Don’t take those [REDACTED].  It happens a lot, in the hospital we wonder why patients have diarrhea and you look at what the medications are [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No, I stopped immediately.
DOCTOR: Okay good, good.
PATIENT: Okay but uh you don't think it's a virus when it keep growling like that?
DOCTOR: No you know it could be a little bit of a  stomach virus but the thing is if you are having diarrhea and it's causing a little bit of virus and you're flushing all your food out of you so you're gonna have a little more like almost a hunger pain.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So that's where the growling could be.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So um I'd say back off the Maalox to every other day for now and just see if that helps the diarrhea at all okay.
PATIENT: I was gonna say maybe I took that infection [REDACTED] again.
DOCTOR: Right.  Now as far as pain on the right, it's you know.
PATIENT: But they say I'll probably have that the rest of my life.
DOCTOR: Rest of your life yeah.
PATIENT: Cause I'm so tore up inside.
DOCTOR: And well you've had quite the experiences um.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: With all [REDACTED] and everything.  I know you had part of a lung taken out.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So a lot of times that sort of pain doesn't resolve you know for a long time.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um okay.  Let's see and you saw Pulmonary um, you saw the lung doctors recently.  You've seen lung and GI um and how and then how long have you been on the oxygen.  How long have you had it with you?
PATIENT: Uh I think, now I'm good, I'm all good when I'm sitting down but when I'm walking.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I got to have it.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  Yeah it says this right here you're saturation on room air just while sitting is 95 but you drop down into the 80s and normal is 99 to 100% and you drop down pretty low when you start walking so um yeah.  You know, unfortunately you’re going to have to haul that thing around. They couldn't give you a smaller tank so?
PATIENT: Well they, when I go back next month.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They gonna put the word in.
DOCTOR: How many liters in one?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Just one liter?
PATIENT: Here, I can't go a long ways, from 5, to 3 to 2.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: Done to 1.
DOCTOR: Good for you.  You're heading in the right direction.
PATIENT: But they said I'll probably be dealing with this the rest of my life because I ran out of breath when I'm walking.
DOCTOR: Exactly you know.  Can you tell the difference in your [REDACTED], do you feel better?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um otherwise I mean that, I know DOCTOR had gotten some lab tests.  Your cholesterol was perfect.  Colonoscopy we're not due until 2012 and then as far as your follow-up with GI [REDACTED] stay hydrated with Gatorade, [REDACTED], that kind of stuff.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Keep the electrolytes on you and then back off the Maalox to every other day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um blood pressure looks perfect.  Your prostate looks good as of last July, so things are looking good there.  Um any fevers or chills at home?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And any coughing?
PATIENT: Yeah a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um is this typical for you?  Do you normally cough?
PATIENT: Yeah every now and then [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: It's time summer's coming in now.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The change in the weather it's affecting everybody.
DOCTOR: I was just gonna say it throws everybody off.  Um your diabetes is really well controlled.
PATIENT: Yeah oh I stay up on that.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] fantastic then the only other thing the glaucoma, do you follow with the?  Do you have glaucoma in the eyes?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you follow with the ophthalmologist, the eye doctors?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Just to make sure you're seeing them.
PATIENT: Right, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It looks like you do a very good job.  You're probably one of the best patients I've seen.
PATIENT: Yeah I don't want to go back.
DOCTOR: You don't want to [REDACTED] no.
PATIENT: I don't want to go backwards, uh uh, I had a rough time, the last since 2007 it's been rough.  You know a patient has to take care of themself, not the doctors; the patient himself has to take care of himself.
DOCTOR: I agree.  It's a team effort.
PATIENT: Yeah that's right.
DOCTOR: Yeah and that's what I walked into a patient's room the other day and I said you know what brings you in here, can't you read my damn chart, I said no and I was like well.
PATIENT: That's why we got a computer.
DOCTOR: And I just said listen I can read your chart all day but you know it's not the same as me talking to you know and he then did calm down a little bit.  [REDACTED].  Um alright uh you look like you're doing a great job.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So let's just back-off on the, do you need any med refills or?
PATIENT: No I just called them in.
DOCTOR: Okay you called them in today.
PATIENT: I just called them in today.
DOCTOR: And you don't need to get labs and you're up-to-date on things.  Let me go run this by DOCTOR and then.  How often do you come back?  Do you come every month or do you come?
PATIENT: No, no he just wanted to see how I'm doing because you know I was feeling kind of bad.
DOCTOR: Right, right.  Well good.  I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  16:57  DOCTOR IN:  20:54)
DOCTOR: Alright sir.  Now are you, okay, so here's what I kind of want to do.  This is sort of difficult so I wanted to send the um stool studies to make sure that there's no infection in your stool.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um so that would mean you'd have to go over and give them a sample.  Are you actively having diarrhea right now?  You know it's not easy.  It's not like they can just take your blood you know you have to.
PATIENT: Well they can give me that thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I could bring it back.  I can do that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Why don't we do that?  Why don’t we do that. It’s better than nothing.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Then we'll just make sure there's no infection in there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Let me ask you something too.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I know it's from my lungs and all that I've been through but you know I feel tired all the time and I take vitamins every day too.  Is there something I could, is there a vitamin that I could take to make me feel more.
DOCTOR: Um awake - not so much and you know the first thing I think of when somebody says they're tired all the time is anemic you know.
PATIENT: I don't think I'm anemic.
DOCTOR: And you're not. I just look. Now the next thing I look at is do you have a thyroid problem, you know, is there something wrong with your thyroid so that would be tested.  You were just checked in October and your thyroid looks perfect so if anything you know with the oxygenation yeah.
PATIENT: That's it.
DOCTOR: And um that's probably a lot of it you know um your body uses the increased energy source to breathe.
PATIENT: Breathing.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Something I got to deal with it I guess.
DOCTOR: Yes.  So you basically want me to do that, right you want to.  So we'll do three different stool studies and you bring them in unless you happens and go over there and meet you to go over them.
PATIENT: Right.  I [REDACTED].  Now I do have to go over and get these from them.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: You put in that now right?
DOCTOR: Yep I just put it in.  Um so how often do you normally, you want to come back in say two months?
PATIENT: Uh yeah, that’s fine [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And then you know, yeah exactly.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That puts you to see DOCTOR in June.  Just cause of all the stuff going on with you, a lot of times I let patients go a little longer than that but with all the stuff going on with your lungs and stuff I think you should come back in a few weeks.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Otherwise I think everything's good.  We'll get your stuff ordered, got the cups and then we'll see you in a month.
PATIENT: Okie doke.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Is he all done with me in the computer?
DOCTOR: Yeah oh you mean.
PATIENT: Cause he follow me up cause you know I travel here.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: They is strict over there.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know.
PATIENT: Real strict.  Take care.
DOCTOR: Hey one more thing though in the chart it says you are supposed to be on three liters.
PATIENT: No, this here?  This is gives me a migraine.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, okay.
PATIENT: But I don't need it.  Like I told the doctors, the lung doctors.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I got [REDACTED], it give me a headache real good.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But the ones at home, I put on humidify [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh yeah okay.
PATIENT: Now I keep that on too.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, let me check okay.
PATIENT: It's a little [REDACTED].  And I think [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Bye sir, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Alright see you.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: 24:38
