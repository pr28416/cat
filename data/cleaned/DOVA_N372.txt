DOCTOR: PATIENT?

DOCTOR: Oh sorry, I'm so sorry hi.
PATIENT: How you doing?
DOCTOR: How are you?  Good to see you again, both of you.  Come on back.  [REDACTED]such a rush.
PATIENT: Why don't you push that, maybe it would.
DOCTOR: How are you doing today?
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Have a seat.
PATIENT: I called for uh; renew that one prescription, pravastatin.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: And they said I got to talk to a doctor.  Now I looked on my printout, not on there no more anyway.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: I don't take that no more?
DOCTOR: Uh I don't think I got, I didn't get any note saying that you needed more.  I'll check on that.
PATIENT: I just got a printout today.
DOCTOR: Right, yeah.
PATIENT: And it's not on there.
DOCTOR: Have you been taking every day though? Or are you out?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, I'm out.
DOCTOR: When was the last time you took it?
PATIENT: Oh, I take it at night and it'd be tonight, otherwise it'd be last night or this morning.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh it's at nighttime so.  I took it last night.  Why isn't it on my list?
DOCTOR: Um it's expired so.
PATIENT: Oh I get it.
DOCTOR: Let's see.  Would you like it sent to you by mail?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then you're levothyroxine or your Synthroid that looks like it's been expired as well.
PATIENT: What is it?
DOCTOR: Your Synthroid, thyroid hormones.
PATIENT: Oh.  No I think that was there, wasn't it?
DOCTOR: Yeah it's called levothyroxine.  Synthroid is the trade name.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Same thing.  So we need to renew that for you.
PATIENT: Looks like I still got some left on that one, I don't know, whatever.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT:
DOCTOR: me to keep taking that.
SECOND PERSON N372
For what reason?  The thyroid?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Now let's go through medications.  Okay, so overall you've been okay though since the last time I saw you a few months ago?
PATIENT: Now what?
DOCTOR: You've been doing okay since I saw you last?
PATIENT: Yeah.  That's how I play.
DOCTOR: Okay um.
SECOND PERSON N372
It's amazing how you young people can do that.
DOCTOR: You know, but it takes a lot of practice you have to learn it in school and train your mind.
SECOND PERSON N372
Yeah, I mean they're training little kids in preschool and that's you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah when I was growing up we learned it when we were in middle school.
SECOND PERSON N372
Yeah.
DOCTOR: And we didn't, there were no computers [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON N372
Oh my God, just when I see your fingers move and I see my little grandkids come over and start just typing away like crazy on the computer.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  Um okay so you're still taking your Coreg 12.5 twice a day for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: You don't have them memorized, your medications?
PATIENT: Yeah that's like a half a tablet yeah.
DOCTOR: And then the water pill you only take when your foot swells right?
PATIENT: I been taking it every day.
SECOND PERSON N372
No.
DOCTOR: Did you have it.
SECOND PERSON N372
Every day, I don't know why cause he keeps going to the bathroom all the time.  Is it necessary for him to take it every day?
DOCTOR: It's um it's not necessary but it helps control your blood pressure and takes like the fluid off.
SECOND PERSON N372
Oh.
DOCTOR: It's not a bad thing if you're doing both and your blood pressure today was great.
SECOND PERSON N372
Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um, let's see and then um you're on the pravastatin 40 mg which has been reordered now.  Um and you saw Cardiology.  I had you go see them [REDACTED].
PATIENT: They added and he.
DOCTOR: They started the lisinopril.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um then they stopped the Plavix.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Alright.
SECOND PERSON N372
Is that a good thing?
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean the Plavix you don't need forever.  It's only for you know a time for a bypass or heart attack or something.  Um and then they also, you still follow with the Coumadin Clinic right?  Your INR today was 2.66 which is good.  Um and then I saw you walk in with a cane, you looked like you were doing fine.  How's that going, any falls or?
PATIENT: I didn't fall.
DOCTOR: No falls.  That's always good.  No falls.
PATIENT: Next spring.
DOCTOR: Um alright and then we're continuing your Synthroid and you did say that DOCTOR already talked to you about that.  Um and in terms of a health maintenance there's really not a whole lot, right now, you know given your age you kind of already had all the shots that you needed and you don't need any more colonoscopies, your last one's normal.  Um and then we talked the last time about following your abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Uh you didn't really have one; it was 2.9 centimeters which may be a little bit more than normal but not quite an aneurysm.  Uh that was seen on CT last summer and then we talked and you didn't really want to follow it every year.  Um so it looks like you're doing pretty well um.
PATIENT: Does it say what my blood test today and Coumadin does it way what it was?  Yeah it was 2. uh actually no, yeah 2.66 today.
DOCTOR: Oh that's good.  Yep.  And I didn't really need you to do any labs this time, but maybe next time. If you wouldn't mind actually now that you're up here, just having a seat on the table.  And I'll just take a quick listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Can you pull that out?
DOCTOR: Oh sure, there you go.
DOCTOR: Let me see if I can get it to work, no I don't think it's going to work, sorry.  Sometimes it.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Do I need to help you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  Take a quick listen to your neck and then your heart and lungs.  Take deep breaths in and out.  Can you open your mouth for me?  Tongue, okay.  I'm just checking your pulse.  I want to take a look at your legs.  Okay you have just a tiny bit of swelling.  Do you feel like this gets worse when you've been on your feet?
PATIENT: Oh I don't even pay attention, I don't know.
DOCTOR: It's just barely anything but the water pill is good for that so you're okay if you don't have it every day.
PATIENT: That's what I take them for.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay.  Alright I'm going to run over and talk with my attending really quick and I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We have to do that unfortunately.
(DOCTOR OUT:  54:11  DOCTOR IN:  56:56)
DOCTOR: Alright.  You're actually good to go um.  I put in all of your refills to be mailed to you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then if you need any labs I'll take care of that before and they'll just have the nurse call you but I don't really need to see you back for six months.
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: You're doing pretty good um.  You know the main thing last time was having you see Cardiology and managing your medications and your blood pressure is controlled, that looks perfect.
SECOND PERSON N372
He's going for eye surgery in June.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cataracts.
DOCTOR: Oh I see okay good.  Um but besides you know the things we already talked about there's really nothing left for me to do.
SECOND PERSON N372
Okay.
DOCTOR: So you're doing good.
PATIENT: The only reason I use that wheelchair is cause it's a long walk to the parking lot.
DOCTOR: I know, that's why they're available.  But I watched you walk, you're walking very well.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: With the cane so that's good.
SECOND PERSON N372
Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome.  Let me walk you over to this.  Alright sir.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Nice seeing you again, take care.
PATIENT: Take care.
DOCTOR: Take care.
