PATIENT: Yeah this is from [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah how long ago was that?
PATIENT: Week.

DOCTOR: I'll be just one second.
(DOCTOR OUT:  80:44  DOCTOR IN:  88:21)
DOCTOR: So, I talked to her about everything that’s going on. Um we both think that you know because that level of fasting and because it looked like your cholesterol was under better control with that medication, I would highly recommend restarting it.
PATIENT: Fine, restart it, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um but now if you start noticing muscle aches or anything like that then tell us.
PATIENT: I've been taking that [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay so you know we'll restart that um and then um do you want to pick it up here or I can have them mail it to you?
PATIENT: Yeah they can mail it to me.
DOCTOR: Yeah I'll do it.
PATIENT: But the um, if you can get the uh.
DOCTOR: The sunscreen?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay, so I'll do that right now.  Okay.
PATIENT: If you could just add that, it should be on the Derm.  I as at the Derm Clinic.
DOCTOR: I think it fell off yeah so I can just renew it.  I can have that mailed to you or you can pick it up.
PATIENT: Yeah just mail it to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: You can do that.
DOCTOR: Okay um so basically we think that you know since you're doing really well you know you can come back to see me and DOCTOR in five to six months um but for just like with the cholesterol we're gonna send a letter out to get labs in the next two months basically, six to eight weeks.
PATIENT: Okay.
