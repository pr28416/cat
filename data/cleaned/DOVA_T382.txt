PATIENT: Oh I see you, I see you.  Alright, so you're new, you're my doctor how huh?
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So my name is DOCTOR.  I'm one of the residents.
PATIENT: What do they call you?
DOCTOR: Hey?
PATIENT: What do your patients call you, doctor?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: So I'll call you DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Okay um so.  [REDACTED] So last time you came to see us in December [REDACTED]@, so it's been almost more than a year.
PATIENT: Right yeah.  So, cause I was doing so well they kicked me around.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, okay.  So you were doing great.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And in the meantime, so the only thing I see here is hypertension for you?
PATIENT: Right but I've had it all my life.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I've had it basically all my life.  I've had hypertension.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, my parents have had hypertension.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So pretty most of my family have hypertension.
DOCTOR: Okay how medications do you take for that?
PATIENT: Uh I take two, I take uh, I take the hydrochlorothiazide two a day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And then I take a cholesterol pill at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So here's the hydrochlorothiazide.  I don't see any cholesterol pills here.  [REDACTED].  So it looks like the last time [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you take how many blood pressure medications do you take?
PATIENT: Two, I think I take two.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Two.
DOCTOR: What's that with?
PATIENT: Uh the lipids, this one here.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Lisinopril.
PATIENT: And then I get hydrochlorothiazide.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  And it seemed like at one time that you were taking uh three medications.
PATIENT: Right, it was stopped right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It was getting better, it was a lot better.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, okay.  And for your cholesterol, I'll try to get the computer to get back here.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] about that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And uh so I'll just go with the other things.  So did you get a flu shot this year?
PATIENT: I don't do flu shots.
DOCTOR: You don't do flu shots okay.
PATIENT: I don't believe in them.
DOCTOR: It shows you got one in 2007 though.
PATIENT: No, if it says that, it's not telling the truth.  I haven't had it before.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: And I've never ever gonna take a flu shot.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If I did it was only because the doctor I had, he was so emphatic.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I liked him so much that I did it that one time.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: With some series I took when I took them, but normally I never, ever, never get the flu shot.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, okay.
PATIENT: I don't believe in the theory because I was born in the generation that we've been inoculated, vaccines, this and that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So one more thing that my body has to fight and it might just put me in a place that I don't want to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: But that's why I don't.  There's enough germs floating around and I already have enough antibodies I believe that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't need anymore.
DOCTOR: Well that's good that you think that.  I don't see any cholesterol [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that's a good thing.
SECOND PERSON T382
[REDACTED] cholesterol is a good thing?
PATIENT: Actually, I still have some left.
DOCTOR: Do you know which one?
SECOND PERSON T382
Not off the top of my head I don't.
PATIENT: Well it should be on there from prior.
DOCTOR: Prior notes?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay so you're taking simvastatin 80 mg.  Are you still taking this [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: You sure?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So your blood tested fine.  Uh so you're taking simvastatin.  It seems that you were taking 80 mg.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Do you think that’s still true?
PATIENT: Well you know how I was taking 80 and you told me to break it in half and take 40, that's probably why I still have all that.
DOCTOR: Oh you take 40 okay.  Let me correct this, so you were taking 40.  And your kidney function is a little bit lower than the usual person.  I think you've heard that before.
PATIENT: Right I've heard that before.
DOCTOR: Yeah but it's been stable.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that's good.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So basically your blood tests look good.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And cholesterol looks good too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you can continue to take your statin.  I'll order that today so that if you run out.  Do you want them to send it to your home?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have one other problem.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have a hernia, oh well I had a hernia.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I don't know if it has, because I didn't have no surgery or if just kind of healed on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay uh so let me examine you and then I can see.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh so you had this for a long time?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Just started?
PATIENT: No um it was I did some heavy lifting at a job.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Over the Christmas holidays.
DOCTOR: Over the Christmas holidays was that it?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So that job ended in probably first or second week of January, so eventually it went down.  [REDACTED] research.  So I knew what the surgery looks like, but but I never knew what a hernia was cause I'd never had one so I looked it up.
DOCTOR: Yeah so those things, you know, you don't have it done when [REDACTED].  Well did say you developed it?
PATIENT: You know um [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: You know um [REDACTED] can affect that.  So it's not something really but I can assess that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  But it's nothing urgent.  Do you have any severe belly pain or difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Nausea?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Vomiting?
PATIENT: No.  I would a came in.
DOCTOR: Because you don’t have those symptoms, it means it’s not urgent.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And is it bothering you a lot?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Not bothering at all?
PATIENT: No it's not bothering me at all.
DOCTOR: So that's going to be basically an elective surgery.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So if you want to do it, if you want to fix it, I just refer you to the Surgery surgeon.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because if it's not bothering you at all right now.
PATIENT: Just leave it alone.
DOCTOR: And if you want to wait, you could just leave it alone.
PATIENT: No there's no pain or anything, no discomfort.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um if you have a pain in a hernia, that's kind of an emergency so you have to come.
PATIENT: Right okay.
DOCTOR: But you don't have any pain right now.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Then uh you can wait, it's up to you.
PATIENT: No it wasn't, well actually the only thing there was a little bit of swelling.  There wasn't no active pain that even occurred.
DOCTOR: Okay let me take a look okay.  Alright so your blood pressure medicines and you still have the blood pressure medicines or do you need refills?
PATIENT: No I think I'm okay [REDACTED] today.  I think a couple of these.  Look at the, I mean I have that and basically I think it's good till March or April of 2007, [REDACTED] I don't know what the number is.
DOCTOR: So, it's only April [REDACTED]@ so I'll refill this one.
PATIENT: Right you have to refill that one.
DOCTOR: And this one's going to be on May.  I'll have to go refill both of them.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And you have some drops for the eyes.
PATIENT: Right but I'm in the Eye Clinic.
DOCTOR: Oh okay so they can refill that.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: On your eyes.  Have you had an ultrasound of your kidneys before?  Do you remember?
PATIENT: Uh I don't remember.  More than likely yes but that's why I think they said it was just something we have to watch.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think I have.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because I've been on hydrochlorothiazide for so many years.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh, I don't know, how many years.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: So hydrochlorothiazide you get 60 pills at a time, I'll change it so you can get 90 pills at a time and then three refills that'll last you for one year.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll send you this.  And what time do you take the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: In the morning.
DOCTOR: In the morning.  Morning is fine but I actually.  Do you check your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: I can.
DOCTOR: You can, you have a machine there?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay so I actually recommend um taking it at night.  The reason is because when you take it in the morning.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It seems in the daytime you have good blood pressure, so when you take it you have a good blood pressure.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Uh but some people have higher blood pressure when they're sleeping.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And then those are the times that we have more risks of having some kind of event like you know.
PATIENT: Yeah but if you take it at night you're going to have to get up in the night and go to the bathroom right?
DOCTOR: With [REDACTED]?  To you pee more with the [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay then we can do this.
PATIENT: Right so if I know exactly what you're saying but if you take it at night then you take it, you know you'll have to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to go to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Okay so [REDACTED] there is more peeing?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So we can keep that in the morning and how about taking the other one, lisinopril at night?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But you know, if you take both in the morning, in the daytime you have a good blood pressure and you say okay I'm fine.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: But at night time you may have a high blood pressure and we don't know.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So if you sleep at night then in the daytime you'll see you know your higher blood pressures.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And if that's controlled I would say don't lower it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Do you see what I am saying?
PATIENT: I know exactly what you're saying.  No I understand completely.  I've been coming here to the doctors for, no, no I understand.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Exactly what you're saying.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That makes all the sense in the world.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let's do that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then there's one shot called Dtap.  I don't know if you've had that before um tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis.  I don't think you had that before.  It prevents from three diseases, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis.
PATIENT: Have I ever had it before?
DOCTOR: You had one called tetanus D.
PATIENT: Yes, yes.
DOCTOR: To prevent tetanus and diphtheria.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: That didn't cover pertussis.
PATIENT: What is pertussis?
DOCTOR: That's what's called uh.
PATIENT: Whooping cough?
DOCTOR: Whooping cough yes and so right now we have this new vaccine so the recommendation from the top is that.
PATIENT: You ask the patient do they want it?
DOCTOR: Yeah we have to ask.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And if the patient is younger than 65.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We recommended everybody to get those um vaccines.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So if you don't mind we can do that today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay let's do that.
PATIENT: I'm doing it because you're new and I like you.
DOCTOR: Then you had a polyp when they did the colonoscopy in 2007.
PATIENT: Right I had a polyp right.
DOCTOR: So the recommendation for you is to repeat the colonoscopy in five to seven years.
PATIENT: That's right.
DOCTOR: So five years is going to be 2012.
PATIENT: That's this year?
DOCTOR: It's this year.
PATIENT: Has it been that long?
DOCTOR: And seven years is going to be uh 2014.
PATIENT: Right.  So I need to be scheduled for a colonoscopy this year.
DOCTOR: Yeah I think if you want to schedule, we can schedule this year.
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: No problem.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Sounds good.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And uh labs, we'll get all the labs we need.  So I was thinking that you might do that so I ordered the lab tests that we need, yeah [REDACTED] great.  So I'll just schedule it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll just schedule it and you get the colonoscopy.
PATIENT: Okay.  Yeah they'll call me and say [REDACTED] they don't tell you the reserve day.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  You had the ultrasound I can't see it here.
PATIENT: And that had to be quite a while ago um when I was in Arizona and it might have been oh six or seven years ago now.  It might need to be repeated if you want another one.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Do you remember having one?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: A renal ultrasound and they said it was normal?
PATIENT: Right.  Okay now it had to be during the summer in maybe 2000.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  So let's see what you got on your hermia, okay.  Do you smoke sir?
PATIENT: No never have.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not one cigarette in my whole life.
DOCTOR: Do you drink?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um how's your weight doing?
PATIENT: Uh I might have gained about 10-15 pounds.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: In the last year.
DOCTOR: Okay are you watching your diet?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Uh no, am I watching my diet, uh try to eat normal.  I don't eat, I don't eat, real good food and vegetables and stuff like that but.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah so this is a, yeah you're right, this is a hernia.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um, [REDACTED].  So it's up to you.  If it's bothering you and you think you want a surgery, you can be referred to Surgery.  I can refer you to Surgery if you want to talk to them um but if you think it's not bothering you right now, unless.
PATIENT: It's bothering me in pain right.
DOCTOR: Right, right, right.
PATIENT: No there's no pain.
DOCTOR: Or does it feel like something's hanging and it's feeling ordinary or no?
PATIENT: I just know it's a true [REDACTED].  But see the thing is, sometimes when I urinate it makes a sound.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause you know the opening there so it makes a sound.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's the only thing that I've noticed.  Other than that there's really no pain or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So is the surgery outpatient?  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um I'm not sure.  I come from other countries.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So where I did my training we used to um have people stay for three or four days um but I don't know how they do, I can ask.
PATIENT: Yeah right, ask them, ask somebody.  Do they do it.
DOCTOR: If it is an outpatient do you want to do it?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If it's an outpatient.
PATIENT: And so mostly what I would do is go on the internet and they will show the surgery because they actually show the whole physical surgery on the internet and this was back in 2000 and they were saying it wasn't outpatient then so I was thinking this is 2012, it ought to be outpatient now.
DOCTOR: After all this time, with shorter stays in the hospital.
PATIENT: Yeah right, right, so you can ask yeah.
DOCTOR: If it's an outpatient you want the surgery.
PATIENT: The surgery right.
