DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay where the cafeteria at.
DOCTOR: Yeah.

DOCTOR: Okay.  The last time we did a stress test for you was in 2008 and you got really short of breath and they had to stop it.  Do you ever remember having an echo done at the VA?  An echocardiogram, it's like an ultrasound of your heart.  I don't see one in the file here.
PATIENT: No I didn't have one here.
DOCTOR: Are you followed anywhere else, like at an outside hospital?
PATIENT: Yeah, I forgot to tell you, I did have a heart procedure in March.
DOCTOR: Oh what happened?
PATIENT: Uh they say I had a block artery.
DOCTOR: Oh they did.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Did they go in through the groin and put in a stent?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Where was that done at?
PATIENT: Uh in Gary.  I got medical records.
DOCTOR: Maybe you could fax those over to me so I could take a look at them.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm gonna see do I have, I might have took them out.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Were you having chest pain at that time?
PATIENT: Uh yes, shortness, I was really short of breath and um I was rushed to the hospital.  No, I don't have them at all.
DOCTOR: How many stents did they place in your heart?

DOCTOR: Just one or?
PATIENT: I think it was one.  See this is the third time they done did something to my heart.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  But you had a heart surgery.
PATIENT: Yeah, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Back in 2001.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  But since then nothing's happened.

PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so now there's two in there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So March is a bad month one for you.
PATIENT: What can I say?
DOCTOR: So since they put the stent in, is anything gotten better or worse or is it the same?
PATIENT: Uh I mean, I don't know.  I don't complain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Same to me.  I mean you know every now and then you feel like uh, discomfort in this area but nothing to cry about.
DOCTOR: Okay.  If it gets bad though, you need to talk to somebody or go to the ED okay.  Cause you do have a lot of cardiac disease that we worry about it.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You know.  Okay, yeah definitely fax me those records okay.  I'll tell them to provide you the fax number.  Um and then when was the last time we checked your cholesterol?  Let's take a look.
PATIENT: I had some blood work done, what was it?
DOCTOR: In February.
PATIENT: Uh yes uh, the doctor had me do it.
DOCTOR: They checked everything but the cholesterol.
PATIENT: That wasn't nice.
DOCTOR: So I had checked your cholesterol, let's see that was in August when I saw you and your um LDL was a little bit high.  It was 123, it's your bad cholesterol is high.  We have you on um a statin; let me see if we changed anything since that time.
PATIENT: It should be down with the good diet I'm using.
DOCTOR: Yeah and you, you're doing really well with your MOVE Program.  Are you taking that pill every single day, that statin?
PATIENT: I forget it sometimes but I take it.
DOCTOR: You forget sometimes.  Try to take it as much as you can and take it every day before you go to bed.  Put it by your nightstand and take it every night because if you keep forgetting to take it your cholesterol can go up and then that's what can give you more heart attacks.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know that one's really, really important.  That one and the Plavix are your two most important medications okay.  Alright so we'll recheck, we'll recheck your cholesterol um.  When are you coming back?  Are you going to be back here us any time soon?
PATIENT: Uh yes, I'm gonna be back uh.
DOCTOR: You're here.
PATIENT: The 24th.
DOCTOR: 4th, okay.  Can I order a fasting lipid profile for then?
PATIENT: Sure I can do it.
DOCTOR: Can you not eat in the morning and get your lab drawn?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Oh I see, they didn't collect it last time, your cholesterol because maybe you weren't fasting.  Make sure you don't eat anything for 12 hours before you have the blood draw.
PATIENT: I didn't eat nothing that day.
DOCTOR: Hmm, that's weird cause it was ordered.  I wonder why.  And then let's see, your sugars, let's take a look at that.  Your liver enzymes look good; your kidneys are working really well.  And we checked your hemoglobin A1c which is like your sugars to see how your sugars are well controlled.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And it was still good then but I'd like to check it again.  I'm gonna check it on the 24th when you get your labs done okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And do you know when we last checked your prostate?  Let's take a look at that.  Okay we'll check your prostate level too.  Still not smoking?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Good for you.  Okay.  And how's your blood pressure been doing?
PATIENT: Uh, I been checking it.  Okay I was hoping that she did this morning, when I just came.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay but I did mine before I came.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Mine was 112/66, I had that.
DOCTOR: That's really good.

DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then my granny is sick in the nursing home.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I ain't around so that's where my wife said.  She said she surprised it was at the number I was.
DOCTOR: Yeah.

DOCTOR: You bet, as long as long as you kind of have a way to.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Take all this.
PATIENT: But that's what we got going on right now.
DOCTOR: So you've got stuff going on.
PATIENT: Right and it's like I'm the oldest one and they all.
DOCTOR: It all falls on you, yeah it's hard.
PATIENT: But I was wondering about that number, the numbers I gave you, you said the one this morning.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Was okay?
DOCTOR: Yeah so your goal for your blood pressure is to stay below 140 the high number.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: High number and then below 90 on the bottom.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Bottom number.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you're anywhere below the 130s, I'm really happy.  We don't want you dropping into the low like 90s or anything like that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But your goal is to stay around like 120s I'm really happy with, 110s I'm really happy with for the systolic blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The top number.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's really what we're focused on.  That prevents your risk of stroke.
PATIENT: That top number is.
DOCTOR: The top number you want it below 140 okay.
PATIENT: Cause I had, you know, even though it's not that active but I do things like when you go to Walgreens and all.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I always stick my arm in there.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  What do you usually get?
PATIENT: Uh on the borderline.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's when I say you know I try to calm myself down but then all this in the family and.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It goes up and down.
DOCTOR: If you're consistently getting high blood pressures, like above the 140.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We can put you on some medications a little bit.
PATIENT: Right.  But it was like border, like I say, it's been dropping and when I seen that 112.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I didn't know what to do and you say that was good.
DOCTOR: It's really good.
PATIENT: Okay good.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I got the machine at home also.
DOCTOR: If you want you can bring it in next time and they can compare our machine to your machine and make sure it's accurate.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Just to kind of know.  Okay and let's see.  What medications you need refilled.  You have that, you have that.  You have Plavix.  The only refill was your blood pressure medication is the only thing that was running out.  Anything else going on?
PATIENT: Uh, no.  Uh I want to know uh could you make appointments for me for the dentist to get some of these broken tooth out of my mouth?
DOCTOR: What's been happening with your teeth?
PATIENT: Well believe it or not, even though when I got out I spent money on dentures; most of the ones that's broken off is the ones I got repaired in the service.
DOCTOR: Oh no.
PATIENT: Oh back then they used to put lead in your teeth to fill.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: You didn't know that?
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Oh go back to history.
DOCTOR: Ouch.
PATIENT: And they all like you know, even though I spent money I even have what you call uh, put in what they screw it in.
DOCTOR: Yeah.

DOCTOR: Yeah where are your broken teeth?
PATIENT: Uh up here, over here.
DOCTOR: Does it make it that hard for you to eat?
PATIENT: Oh I survive.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I know how to work it around.  Yeah I can go get me a plate and I know the VA don't take care of that, that's alright.  They do enough for me.
DOCTOR: We'll see.  They are very picky on who they will actually see in Dental.
PATIENT: Right, I know.
DOCTOR: I'll put the order in and let's see what we can do.
PATIENT: Okay.  That's all we can do.

PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: You've heard of that?  So did you have chicken pox as a kid?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.  If you had chicken pox as a kid that virus you know stays in your system and when you get older, like above the age of 60, your immune system it starts to kind of go down.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then um it can flare-up and it causes like a very painful rash.  It can cause like neuropathy and stuff.  Usually we just vaccinate so it doesn't kind of kick back in in your later years.
PATIENT: Don't matter, if I need to get it tell me.
DOCTOR: Alright let's do it.  Okay.  Have you ever had a handicapped sticker before?
PATIENT: No.

PATIENT: May 22nd.
DOCTOR: Maybe we can order it um, if you don't mind we'll just order it now and it's just a screen to make sure you don't have an aneurysm in your aorta.  People that have smoked in the past are at higher risk for an aneurysm and they can rupture and you can bleed internally.
PATIENT: No problem.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I'm going to go ahead and order it.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You the doctor.

DOCTOR: Alright sir, you're all set.  So we'll do the labs when you come back for the MOVE Program.  I'm also going to put in um uh a consult cause you know the last time we checked your sugars they were like creeping up and they were almost at the level of diabetes and we don't want that to happen.  So I'm just gonna send you to our nutritionist that'll give you just some pre-diabetic stuff to avoid, so we don't ever get to that point.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And that's it and then I'll have you follow up with me.  We could do another six months if you prefer we could do I don't know, what do you like, how often do you like to come in?
PATIENT: Well it could be every three, four months, I don't care.
DOCTOR: Okay we'll do that.  We could do four months.  And really try to take your lipid medication, the simvastatin.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And even if you can't remember it at night take it in the morning, you could take it every morning if it doesn't work at night.
PATIENT: That'd probably be the best time.
DOCTOR: Then do that, that's fine.  We really want to make sure you get it okay.  Okay.
PATIENT: Okay what about that other form I gave you?
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, you know what let me just ask her, I totally forgot, one second.
(DOCTOR OUT:  73:30  DOCTOR IN:  76:37)
