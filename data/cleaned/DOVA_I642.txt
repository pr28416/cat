PATIENT: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON I642
He called your name and didn't see you.  How are you good.
PATIENT: Pardon?
SECOND PERSON I642
How are you?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON I642
Okay.
DOCTOR: Been real busy today.   I'm trying to; uh excuse me for one second okay.  Alrighty.  So, I've been looking through your chart a little to try and make sure you know take a look at things that have been happening and it sounds like you know, we kinda figured out what was going on with the blood pressure medications you know.
SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You know.  Uh what they did in Neurology, when they did the Dopplers they were concerned that you know there was basically a whole, occlusion of one side of the blood that goes to the brain basically.  So when we lowered your blood pressure with the medications it was causing the blood pressure to be low enough that there were parts of the brain that were not happy with it because all the blood was being supplied by this other section basically.  So obviously we're gonna hold off on the blood pressure okay.  How have you been feeling since we've been holding off on the blood pressure medication, better, worse, same?
PATIENT: Some days are pretty good and then other days I don't feel too good.
DOCTOR: Okay.  More often good days than bad days?
PATIENT: Well uh, more often good days.
DOCTOR: Has it improved at all since changing the way you were taking your medications?  I know you were dizzy all the time and.
PATIENT: Yeah I was dizzy [REDACTED] but it wasn't bad you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But some days it's much worse you know.
DOCTOR: Any new you numb, weakness, numbness, tingling anywhere?
PATIENT: Yeah I still have tingling up in the head [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  So the brain doctors, when you saw them, thought you know the tingling in the hand was consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.
SECOND PERSON I642
Hmm.
DOCTOR: On your [REDACTED] side.  Basically it's nothing dangerous okay.  Something just you know there's a nerve bundle that goes through the wrist here and its just a little too tight for it, so it gets irritated and so it gets that numbness and tingling okay.  What I'm really worried about is more strokes and things like that,  okay.  So um, why haven't you guys gone back to follow-up with the brain doctors?
SECOND PERSON I642
No we have, so with the neurologist?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON I642
When did they want to see [REDACTED] I didn’t know he had another one [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well apparently.
SECOND PERSON I642
Cause like I called when we got a reminder and the receptionist said that we had made the appointment already so we didn't have to worry about making another one, we just got the reminder, if they needed to see us they would let us know.
DOCTOR: So, let's get you back to Neurology and do a consult.  I think they wanted to see you after all the MRIs and stuff like that.  To see if there’s any usefulness in me opening this up, okay.  So [REDACTED] I think we'll set it up.
SECOND PERSON I642
I know.
DOCTOR: I know you had something like this done before where they would go in and open up the artery to see [REDACTED] wasn’t clogged any more. Um.  It might make a difference in how the [REDACTED] and how you feel okay and it may or may not prevent more strokes.  I'm not sure about that to be honest um but it may be something we can work on.  Um.
SECOND PERSON I642
[REDACTED] too.  He just saw, was that the nurse that they were calling [REDACTED]?  What was his findings on that, you said something about his pressure was high?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
SECOND PERSON I642
Something else was low?
DOCTOR: His heart rate is a little low.
SECOND PERSON I642
Okay his heart rate.  Cause you know I was thinking on my way in, he said he was feeling a little dizzy as he was coming in and I looked at his sugars [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um, the last time he was here, do you know what it was last, it was on the lower side [REDACTED] 40s, 50s.
SECOND PERSON I642
[REDACTED] in the past.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON I642
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] they did an echo for you right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: No.  You did that [REDACTED] right?  Or [REDACTED] everything else.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON I642
No [REDACTED] cardiologist too [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Well we'll probably do another EKG for you today okay.  Um do me a favor; uh take off your shirt as much as possible.  Are you going to be cold? [REDACTED] a little bit, left me see if I have [REDACTED].  Take off both your shirts for me, [REDACTED] machine [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
SECOND PERSON I642
[REDACTED]
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Sit over there while you take off your jacket [REDACTED].  Go ahead and [REDACTED] for me.  No chest pain, no palpitations, nothing like that right?
PATIENT: No chest pain.
DOCTOR: Worsening shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No.
SECOND PERSON I642
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Huh.
SECOND PERSON I642
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Sorry this might be a little cold okay.  [REDACTED].  I'm going to have you turn around to your side and lie down for a me okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat.
SECOND PERSON I642
He might need some help.
DOCTOR: Do you need help lifting up your legs or?  Excellent.  Probably get a little bit [REDACTED].  I'll just put some more stickers on your leg now and everybody's smart wearing like two layers of pants.  I’m not that smart.  All my patients today have been uh I'm like wow you guys are really smart cause I'm freezing when I'm walking on the outside.  [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Connect all these stickers to these wires and let's just put the [REDACTED] here okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Alright while I'm doing this I'm just going to ask some more questions okay.  No blood in the stool, no black stool?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Appetite's good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON I642
Yeah four or five times a day.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Eating is very pleasurable so.  It’s alright.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] that much.
DOCTOR: No changes in your weight right?  No changes in your stool.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] clothes on.
DOCTOR: Good.  Alright I want you to just breathe regular and don't move your arms and legs okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You comfy?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna do just one more okay.  [REDACTED] alright [REDACTED].  Do you want me to take [REDACTED] souvenirs? [REDACTED] stickers on it or should I take them off?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well usually [REDACTED] getting back to work.
DOCTOR: Wow you are a very ambitious gentleman.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Let me ask you a question um, what type of work do you do?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] Security. Drive around.
DOCTOR: Drive around [REDACTED] I'd like to see you a little better in terms of your dizziness at first before you get back [REDACTED].  I don't want you exerting yourself too much right now. Until we figure out.
PATIENT: Cause I don't know how long they're holding my job for me.
DOCTOR: Oh I see.
PATIENT: The pressure is on here.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I need the work.
DOCTOR: For the money.  When are you gonna be able to take a break?  You know you're getting on in your years you know.
PATIENT: When I die. (Laughs)  But the bills don’t stop, they keep coming in, they just try to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Do you live by yourself.
PATIENT: No [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Think of what I'm saying.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What kind of bills are we talking about?
PATIENT: Gas bills, light bills, car loans [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: We'll talk about that in a second.
PATIENT: Taxes, property taxes, you know all that stuff.
DOCTOR: How much longer do you think you can take off before it becomes problematic?
PATIENT: From this job, I don’t know. [REDACTED]  But that's why they moved in [REDACTED] latter part of November when I left.
DOCTOR: Do you have to do anything strenuous? I don't want to see you driving if you're dizzy, so if that’s that part of your job that you so, I don't think you should do.
SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Even if you go back there I would not recommend, you can put on your clothing, but I would not, when it comes down to you not [REDACTED].  Um if you really had to go back to work, about [REDACTED] dizziness.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But if you have to go back to work I'd recommend activities where you’re not going to be chasing down anybody, you're not doing any type of heavy lifting.  But still you could monitor and watch the screen and I think that'd be okay but any type of long patrolling where you're gonna be walking unsteady or on icy areas or anything like that I don't really recommend that okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] maybe one time you know.  So my only shelter is in the car [REDACTED].  So I'm gonna have to hole up I guess.
SECOND PERSON I642
Yes.
PATIENT: Nothing to do about it.
DOCTOR: I want to bring you back to see the brain doctors and you can see what they recommend in terms of if this needs to be fixed or um and I want you to see improvement [REDACTED] in terms of your dizziness but I have to be honest uh you're getting on in the age where I prefer to see my patients things a little more easier.
SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh. Me too.
PATIENT: Alright.
SECOND PERSON I642
[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know you've got bills to pay um but your, is there anything else you can cut back on so that you don't have to work?  Are you getting Social Security benefits and things like that already?
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And that's not.
PATIENT: Won't cover it.  That's only about a thousand a month.
SECOND PERSON I642
Then we didn't have nothing in savings for a little while.
DOCTOR: What about a different kind of job, [REDACTED] you find you're in a position where you get to watch monitors [REDACTED] security rather than just walking around or driving?  Cause that's reasonable for me if you’re not.
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: You don't, they don't require you to drive where you can just hang out at some place for a while, not worry about slipping on ice and falling [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh. I don’t know
SECOND PERSON I642
See the other thing is [REDACTED]. Is just, is just [REDACTED] around the block.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] about a block, a block and a half long where I travel around.
SECOND PERSON I642
Do you get out at all?
PATIENT: Yeah, I get out and uh [REDACTED] and go on to the next station.  [REDACTED].
SECOND PERSON I642
Then get in the car and ride on to the next one.
PATIENT: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON I642
Okay you know [REDACTED] get back around [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Right.
SECOND PERSON I642
All day.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  That's what I say.
SECOND PERSON I642
So just basically now [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How about this, I can't tell you not to not to feed yourself, uh but let's say let's put it off as long as possible, talk to your employer and maybe see if they can work something out where there's less you know, being able to hopefully when the weather gets a little better or less – but you still have to drive, though.
PATIENT: I'll walk.
DOCTOR: You'll walk.
PATIENT: About a block a day.
DOCTOR: Are you, [REDACTED] are you driving on the street or is it all over in the parking lot?
PATIENT: No [REDACTED], in a big lot.
SECOND PERSON I642
In the [REDACTED] houses.
PATIENT: It's just.
SECOND PERSON I642
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: One big lot that's what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you're not in any danger of having to worry about other cars?
PATIENT: No, no.
SECOND PERSON I642
No.  Not until it's time to go home.  Then he drive on the street to come back home.
PATIENT: That doesn't bother anybody but me.
SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You know as your doctor I can't say that it's okay for you to drive.
PATIENT: I understand.
DOCTOR: Uh but you know driving around an empty lumber yard is better than driving in traffic.
PATIENT: Okay.
SECOND PERSON I642
True.
DOCTOR: Um we're gonna leave it at that.
PATIENT: Alright [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Well my advice is to put it off as long as possible, talk to your employer, see how long they can hold your job for and how [REDACTED] and take it from there.  But while we're holding it off I want to make sure you go back to see the brain the neurologist okay and let them take it from there okay.  I'm certainly sensitive to what you're saying.  You need to take care of yourself.  You can't, if you don't have housing, if you don't have food, it's hard to take care of other things. I completely understand that, okay.  Give me one second; I want to chat with DOCTOR okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  53:47  DOCTOR IN:  61:50)
DOCTOR: Sorry, [REDACTED].  I'm not gonna do that much for you today but I'm gonna take you back to the brain neurologist and I'm also going to set you up with the vascular doctors okay.  The vascular doctors are the ones that would look at your neck to see if uh you would benefit opening whether we should open [REDACTED] or not, okay.  I think those are really the people who would do you the most good in terms of hopefully getting better circulation to your brain, hopefully getting rid of the dizziness okay.  So I'm going to do that as soon as possible.  The other thing is um your cholesterol it's pretty good but it's still slightly high and for people who have this type of disease, [REDACTED] usually we want your cholesterol a little lower okay.  Are you okay with uh taking a cholesterol medication?  Do you have any problems with taking the cholesterol medications?
PATIENT: No I'll give it a go.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] I think I was supposed to [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I don't see that you're on it right now.
PATIENT: No I'm not.  I haven't take it for [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Are you okay with you restarting it again?
PATIENT: Yes.  That'll work.  I've taken it before, no problem.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It'll be a low dose.  I mean you're right on the borderline.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay cause we want you to be below at least 100, maybe even lower so we'll just start you on a low dose and see how you do with that.  Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's the only thing I would change in terms of your medication.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now your blood pressure looked okay today.  Heart looks okay today.  Um if you're consistently low like this and you're still having your dizziness I might send you back to um what we'd do, is what we call doing a Holter basically.  A Holter is, they just strap something along, or maybe it’s stickers, I'm not sure but it's just to monitor your heart rate over a certain time okay.  If the vascular doctors don't think this is causing the dizziness I may do that Holter okay.  To see if the low heart rate is the reason why you're uh dizzy.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: To be honest I'm not sure that it is.  Your blood pressure is [REDACTED], okay.
PATIENT: I don't have to go back to the MRI thing anymore?
DOCTOR: You didn't like that huh?
PATIENT: No, I don't want to go back and do that.
DOCTOR: Well I don't want to speak for the vascular doctors but my perspective is that you know we've already documented your anatomy, we know that there's a narrowing there, we know you've had strokes in the past um so I don't know what we'd gain from that um but I can't speak for other clinics okay.  And if they order it make sure you let them know that you're very anxious and you didn't like it and maybe they can give you some medication to relax you.
SECOND PERSON I642
That's what I told him.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright um let me order the medication that I want to give you.  It's called simvastatin okay.
SECOND PERSON I642
I take that.
DOCTOR: Uh and so you need to look out for you know some muscle aches um sometimes it can cause that but very rarely okay.  Um let's see when was the last time we checked your liver functions, usually we like to have a baseline before we do that.  Okay.  Okay checked in November and it was perfect.  So um I can go ahead and start the medication but after a month and after you've been taking we usually check your liver again to see if you're doing okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause sometimes this can interact with the liver a little bit.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Give me one second; I want to put in the referral to the vascular doctor okay.  I [REDACTED] give me one second.  [REDACTED] are the doctors.  Alright, so do me a favor, when you go back outside you're going to need two appointments made okay.  Neurology next available and I want you to see Peripheral Vascular Surgery also next available.  I want you to see them as soon as possible okay.  And then for me would two months sound reasonable for you guys or is that too soon?  Cause I want to make sure that nothing gets dropped and doctors see you the appropriate tests.  [REDACTED].  Or you can see me you know.  I just want to make sure it's okay with you because you know if I bring you back too much and you don't like me anymore then I don't want that to happen.
PATIENT: No that's fine.
DOCTOR: Of course you have a choice, that's why I asked.  You know I want to make sure it's okay with you that I bring you back so often cause you know.  Normally I wouldn't see somebody as often as I would see you because I'm seeing so often cause I want to get as much stuff done as possible so you can go back to work when you need to and also I want to make sure that your dizziness gets better okay.  But I mean, but if it becomes a hardship for you to come see me so often, then of course we want to work together and make sure it doesn't become worse okay.  Before you come to see me next time, do me a favor, don't eat breakfast and we'll get some blood tests on you so um the next time you come see me in about two months, come a little earlier.  Whenever your appointment is come earlier so you can get the blood tests done at the Lab and then come see me afterwards.  Okay.
SECOND PERSON I642
So don't eat.
DOCTOR: Yeah, don't eat that morning.  Okay, but for today please make these two appointments up front okay.
SECOND PERSON I642
Any more questions?  And you got [REDACTED] earlier.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Take your time, if you have questions, think about them for a little bit.
SECOND PERSON I642
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh yeah.  Maybe they cut that out, I don't know.
SECOND PERSON I642
Maybe [REDACTED] you don’t know.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] here for you.
PATIENT: Now at one time uh this was back in the 80s [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Monetarily.
DOCTOR: Monetarily.  Uh I think that's reasonable um. Let’s see.
PATIENT: I don't know if they still do it now.
DOCTOR: It’s certainly worth a try to ask. It’s certainly worth a try to ask. Let me see who to ask to find out. So when you go back up front there's a number, to a social worker number.
SECOND PERSON I642
What is it?
DOCTOR: And those would be the people you would talk to to see if you quality for any [REDACTED] or things like that okay.
SECOND PERSON I642
Okay [REDACTED] social worker.
DOCTOR: They will be the most up-to-date people who would know what you'd be qualified for okay.  But yeah, don't hesitate, okay.  Whatever we can do to help, definitely [REDACTED] do it okay.
SECOND PERSON I642
That's it?
DOCTOR: That is it.
PATIENT: Okay good enough.
SECOND PERSON I642
Thank you sir.  You have a good day now.
DOCTOR: You two take care, uh-huh.
PATIENT: 73:57
