DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: How you doing today?
PATIENT: Pretty good and yourself?
DOCTOR: I'm good.  I'm DOCTOR, I work with DOCTOR.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Um, I was talking to DOCTOR, who I know you saw last time.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um so how you doing today?
PATIENT: Still have back pain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And the headaches.
DOCTOR: When do you see [REDACTED] again?
PATIENT: Uh I just saw them Monday.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And they said that they were still waiting for the report?
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: Is that right?  Cause I think they're the ones that have to make the decision if they want to treat your headache so what they want to do.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay um it looks like from your tests though that the EEG that they did where they stuck all those electrodes on your head.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: It looked normal.  So the findings were normal and symmetrical patterns were seen.  No evidence was seen in the sleep and waking methods or any focal or diffuse abnormalities so that's good.  At least they don't see anything wrong.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: But she said something about a concussion, a mild concussion or something.
DOCTOR: Are they gonna do?  Well on the EEG Report it doesn't show any of that.  Um I don't know what she said.  If she said anything about a concussion because she didn't write anything about it and then are they gonna do like a MRI or anything like that?  Oh they did the MRI.
PATIENT: Well they did most of all the testing.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I don't know about any more testings.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The only thing that she said that it would be in a report was a mild concussion.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I think we need to have you see the neurologist again though.
PATIENT: Uh when?
DOCTOR: To see if they want to do anything about it.  Um.
PATIENT: Just saw them Monday.
DOCTOR: They basically said awaiting results of the ABER for post concussive symptoms.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And loss of balance.  Seen by ENT surgery who have suggested surgery treatment of migraine equivalent if the ABER  result is also normal.  And the ABER results are normal so that's, they probably recommend treating the migraine then.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um, regarding your back pain [REDACTED] of the entire back.  Um, when was that done? October. Okay.  What are you taking for pain?
PATIENT: Well I'm taking the tramadol.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And the neurologist asked me to cut back on the, cut back on the um Tylenol because they can damage my liver.
DOCTOR: Can hurt your liver.
PATIENT: Yeah they can damage my liver.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh they want me to take the Tylenol just rather than four times a day, take it one time a day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just to cut back you know, but what I'm saying after I cut back.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then what am I gonna use for the pain?
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: I know that they increased the dosage of tramadol to 50%.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I don't know, I know they increased one of them to 50%.
DOCTOR: So how often are you taking the Tylenol right now?
PATIENT: I was taking it four times a day.
DOCTOR: Is that one tablet or two tablets four times a day?
PATIENT: Two tablets four times a day.
DOCTOR: And now what are you taking?
PATIENT: Now I'm taking two tablets once a day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because they said I've been taking the Tylenol for a long period of time.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Which has been over a year.  Almost a year and six months.
DOCTOR: Okay and the tramadol how much or how often are you taking it?
PATIENT: The tramadol twice a day.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you can take the tramadol up to four times a day.
PATIENT: Increase it?
DOCTOR: Yeah you can take it up to four times a day.  That's how it's order at least.  Do you have your bottles?
PATIENT: No I don't have it.
DOCTOR: Yeah if you read the medication bottle it says it on there too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um the Tylenol, I don't know why they would tell you to take less.  You've had liver function tests done.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And that was in February.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And they actually don't look bad so you can actually take more Tylenol than just two tablets once a day.
PATIENT: What are you suggesting we take?
DOCTOR: Um the maximum dose is taking two tablets four times a day.
PATIENT: So that's eight tablets a day.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: That's what I was taking.
DOCTOR: That was, yeah that's the maximum you can take per day.
PATIENT: Go back to taking them?
DOCTOR: Well how's your pain doing?
PATIENT: Well I'm still with the pain.
DOCTOR: Is it mostly back pain?
PATIENT: No both, headaches and back pain.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So what I'm asking you is.
DOCTOR: Is what you should do.
PATIENT: Because the neurologist said cut back now you're telling me to keep taking them.
DOCTOR: Well I don't know.  The neurologist really didn't write too much in her note here um, why she would actually say that.
PATIENT: Because she said because of my liver.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  If you take it in high doses or more than the recommended amount yeah.
PATIENT: But I'm just taking what's recommended.
DOCTOR: I understand.
PATIENT: On the bottle you know.  Why would she say cut back on it and you said take more?
DOCTOR: I think take what's recommended on the bottle.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Your liver isn't bad, right?  Are you a drinker?
PATIENT: I don't drink.
DOCTOR: No, oh well, okay.  Um let's see.  So then how have your sugars been doing?
PATIENT: I assume it was normal, I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Do you check it every day?
PATIENT: Yes I checked it uh once every day.
DOCTOR: Your sugars.
PATIENT: I check it in the morning and don't check it that evening, check it the following evening after the meal, two hours after meals that's what he told me now.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you have the numbers?  You have a lot of sugars in the 90s. Do you eat a lot of sugary food at night?
PATIENT: Um not, I'm trying to stick with it.  Sometimes I fall off you know.  I try to keep up with it.
DOCTOR: Actually they're not too bad.  You've got [REDACTED] here now.
PATIENT: Guess that's when I fall off the wagon as they say.
DOCTOR: Why did you check your blood sugar at 2:08 in the morning, is the timing on these right?
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: When was the last time you checked your blood sugar?
PATIENT: I checked it.
DOCTOR: The 135 and what time is that from?
PATIENT: That uh in the morning, that was last night the last one.
DOCTOR: This 130 happened last night?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You're gonna have to, take it to the pharmacist today, have him change the time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Because it says 1:12 p.m. so this looks like its yesterday after lunch.
PATIENT: Just take it to the Pharmacy and tell them to change the.
DOCTOR: Yeah, they need to change the settings.
PATIENT: I'm not up at 1:47 in the morning.
DOCTOR: That's what I, well yeah, this is at 1:12 p.m. and then this is at 2:08 a.m. which doesn't make too much sense.
PATIENT: No, no.  I'm not up that time of the morning.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Is the time incorrect, can you set it?
DOCTOR: I don't know how to set it.  That's why I said take it to the pharmacist, it's the first door on the right and they can actually do it for you.
PATIENT: Is it all the way down?
DOCTOR: No on this hallway.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The first door on the right, with the blond lady, short blond hair.  She's with DOCTOR [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Where about over here?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Straight across?
DOCTOR: In this hallway.  It's the first, when you're coming towards this way it's the first door on the right.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So when you're leaving here, it's the last door on the left.
PATIENT: Okay so it's just like where the uh blood test area?
DOCTOR: I'll take you there, don't worry about it.
PATIENT: Because the only pharmacist I know of is the one all the way at the end down there.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Are you taking amitriptyline at bedtime?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Is that helping at all?
PATIENT: Uh, cause I don't, because I'm not, at least I'm getting some sleep.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: Are you still taking meclizine?
PATIENT: Yes I am.
DOCTOR: You are taking it three times a day?
PATIENT: Taking all my meds, even some of the stomach.
DOCTOR: Are you still smoking?
PATIENT: No I'm trying to cut back.
DOCTOR: And when was the last time you had a cigarette?
PATIENT: Uh day before yesterday.
DOCTOR: How often are you smoking?
PATIENT: I'm trying to smoke as less as possible.
DOCTOR: I know but like how often, like four cigarettes a week or?
PATIENT: Uh something like two maybe three.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I cut way back on the smoking.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I used to smoke a pack every other day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so youâ€™ve been making progress, then.
PATIENT: This gum has helped it sometimes but sometimes you just get the craving.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Nothing like that cigarette [REDACTED].  So it's alright because I [REDACTED] somebody from the Surgery Clinic that was supposed to be for March 4.
DOCTOR: What happened?
PATIENT: They called my house.

PATIENT: And everything is normal for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, your sugar could be under slightly better control but you should be okay yeah.

DOCTOR: Yeah, it's just that we need to recheck some labs today to see how you're doing.  And uh you ate today I take it?
PATIENT: I ate this morning.
DOCTOR: Has it been eight hours since you ate?

DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Because it was before.  It was like my head was like spinning when I get up.

DOCTOR: Um and then one more thing, the metformin that you're taking for diabetes, we're gonna bump it up a little bit.  Um you're on 500 mg twice a day, we're gonna go up to 850 [REDACTED] a day.  And the metformin shouldnâ€™t cause any low blood sugars, but your sugars are still high and we need to get them lower.  Do you usually get your meds by mail or do you want to pick them up?
PATIENT: No I'll pick it up.
DOCTOR: Okay.
