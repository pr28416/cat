PATIENT: [REDACTED], I take them right, right.
DOCTOR: You do those.  Okay cause you have some blood pressure medicines so it looks like maybe you did have high blood pressure.
PATIENT: Well I thought I did cause you know I knew it was kind of high, I knew if I'd feel dizzy when I'd be walking.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I'd feel a little dizzy but after a while, cause I quit what I was doing and it'd go away.

DOCTOR: Okay so you don't need that one I guess.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um.  They have you on iron supplements, was your iron low, do you know?
PATIENT: Yeah I was gonna ask you if you know, but I'm taking two iron supplements.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Let me see how they were.
PATIENT: One of them I still have quite a few but the other one's kind of low.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Let me see what they put you on.  Maybe they want you to have it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Oh your hemoglobin is very low, that's your blood count, okay.  And when you take the iron are you having problems with constipation at all?
PATIENT: No, not at all.
DOCTOR: No okay.
PATIENT: I don't take the [REDACTED] any more.
DOCTOR: The oh you don't take the stool softeners anymore?
PATIENT: No, they make me keeping running.
DOCTOR: Oh.  So even, but you are taking the iron.
PATIENT: I take those.
DOCTOR: Okay just the stool softener.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Is the one you aren't taking?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay and do you need more of the gabapentin?
PATIENT: What?
DOCTOR: Gabapentin is the one; I'm assuming they probably gave it to you like sometimes after you have an amputation you have sensations like you know like your leg is still there.
PATIENT: Yeah I do have those.
DOCTOR: You do have those.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Okay so we'll make sure we refill those.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh it looks like you're pretty much out of everything actually.
PATIENT: Except that one iron pill, I have quite a few of those.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.  Let's make sure we reorder all that stuff for you then.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Do you want to pick it up here or do you have an address that it can be mailed to or?
PATIENT: Well picking up is better.
DOCTOR: Okay, since you're here you might as well go get it.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Make sure you keep taking those vitamins too.
PATIENT: Of course I'm gonna keep taking the vitamins.
DOCTOR: Um sounds like you used to drink quite a bit.
PATIENT: Oh yes.
DOCTOR: So you probably have some vitamin deficiencies.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Uh it is pretty hard for you to get out here?
PATIENT: I just, I call for the free ride, the chauffeur.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So it'd probably be easier to give you 90 day supplies, what do you think?
PATIENT: That’d be good.
DOCTOR: Will that work?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Where are you living at?  Do you have somewhere to live?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  ADDRESS.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You know we can change this metoprolol to; they have you on 25 every eight hours.  We could change it to once a day and that'll be easier I assume.
PATIENT: You want me to take it two times a day?
DOCTOR: I'll change it so it can be just once a day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Rather than taking it [REDACTED] times a day, that’s kind of a lot.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Are you pretty good about taking medicines or?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] to take it, about five hours later, the one that I take two times a day.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] all between 6 and 6.
DOCTOR: Good.  Oh it looks like we don’t have the once a day here, so we'll do it twice a day but we can change it to two times a day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Are you taking the aspirin still?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.  It must be hard for you to go to uh starting taking all these pills when you're not used to it right?
PATIENT: Well [REDACTED] muscles got kind of used to it, [REDACTED] weights @@ take it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah that's the way.
DOCTOR: Yeah keep taking it, I know it's hard but you can.  You got plenty of support at home, people to help you out?
PATIENT: Oh just me really so.
DOCTOR: It's just you.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You live by yourself?
PATIENT: Oh no, there's another person, my roommate there.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: She's there yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And you follow up with uh, with Podiatry and everything.
PATIENT: Yes I go there next when I'm done here.
DOCTOR: Oh today.
PATIENT: Yeah I have an appointment at 1 o'clock, a 1 o'clock appointment and a 2 o'clock with him.
DOCTOR: You have a 2 o'clock appointment.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh [REDACTED] that's why I'm late.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy before?
PATIENT: I don't even know what that is.
DOCTOR: Um well if you've never been to the doctor you probably haven't had it.
PATIENT: No I haven't.
DOCTOR: Um it's where they use um a camera and a tube and they look in your colon that goes through.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, I understand that, no.
DOCTOR: You've never had it before though right?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you know, you know we usually actually suggest people start having them when they're 50 years old.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um and then have them every 10 years usually just to look for cancer.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Mainly because um we've gotten so good, well we, as doctors, not me, I don’t do them, but have gotten really good at finding them early so that if they are removed early.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: That we can prevent cancer from forming.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: Um and then that's better than letting them you know be there, develop over time and keep developing.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Then it causes a problem and then by the time, if you catch it late then it's um less likely that you can be cured from it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So um if you're up to it, if you're interested I can set you up for it.
PATIENT: That's the thing, they use a camera up your.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: I'd like to think about this.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I know I have to actually, my dad was not very happy with him when I forced him to do it.  Why don't you think about it, next time I see you then we can?
PATIENT: Okay the next appointment yeah; I'll give you the answer.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, alright.  Give me just a second okay.
