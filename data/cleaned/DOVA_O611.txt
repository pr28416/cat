DOCTOR: PATIENT.
PATIENT: Over here.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  It's just past the Pharmacy.  Alright, how you doing today?
PATIENT: Doing alright.
DOCTOR: Okay uh.
PATIENT: Is this just an annual?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, it's just a routine visit here so if you have anything specific you want to talk about we can talk about that otherwise I'll have some questions and some generic stuff here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But how you feeling?
PATIENT: I'm feeling okay.  I still get like a strange pain in my right hip.  I just had it done in February.  I don't know what that means.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But maybe it's just arthritis, I'm not sure.  That's the way they're talking to me cause they done had x-rays done and everything is looking good they're saying but um.
DOCTOR: You had it done February of last year right?
PATIENT: Yes, it's been a year.  It's been over a year now.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean it looks like, you know you had the hip replacement there.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Uh it looks like it's in position properly.  Cause you know once you have the joint replaced it's a little, you know arthritis is not really gonna happen right cause you've got a prosthetic joint in there now.  But it's just, you know the things you worry about is if it's not aligned properly or something like that but it looks like it's in proper position.
PATIENT: According to what they tell me with the x-rays.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I guess its okay you know.  I don't really know but.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Have you been taking anything for the pain?
PATIENT: Just the Vicodins.
DOCTOR: Does that help?
PATIENT: Yes.  Yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh I'm running low on my prescription now.
DOCTOR: Which one for Vicodin?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay for your hip yeah.
PATIENT: And then um one other thing um.  The blood pressure pills that they give me.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay I guess that's like my fault.  Sometimes like this morning I just totally forgot but I've been on it for the last two weeks you know straight you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But um.
DOCTOR: And that's what you're on lisinopril and you're on amlodipine.  You're on two?
PATIENT: Yes.  Half pill on each.
DOCTOR: Half and half exactly and the lisinopril it looks like you're about to run out here.
PATIENT: So that's.
DOCTOR: So I'll refill that for you.  Your blood pressure today actually looks pretty good.
PATIENT: Yeah but I didn't take my medicine and usually when I take that medicine you know I run my blood pressure I'm like below 120 it was like 118.
DOCTOR: That's alright.
PATIENT: One.
DOCTOR: That's fine.
PATIENT: Really?  I'm not sure you know I'm just.
DOCTOR: No, no, that's fine.  The only time you worry about, there's nothing saying, a low blood pressure is that you're getting symptomatic from it.  You're feeling dizzy, lightheaded; weak like you're gonna pass out, that's too low.  Otherwise 118, 120, that's fine.
PATIENT: Yeah.  That means it's normal right?
DOCTOR: Yeah actually 120 is what we try to run as normal.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You know we want you to stay around there.  A little bit lower than that's okay, a little bit higher than that's okay, it's kind of a generalized range.
PATIENT: So anything below 90 then?
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean, are you dropping below 90?
PATIENT: There's times when I read it I am below 90 you know or like 90 now I don't know if its gonna be the pill and then I'll start taking them because you know I do feel like lightheaded and stuff.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then I stop taking them and then I feel better.  But I don't know if it's the medicine or and you know what here's my problem though I'm not doing it uh consistently you know, the way I'm supposed to do it.  I fail sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then they told me, my brother told me well if I don't take that medicine regularly at the right time or whatever it changes all my uh.
DOCTOR: It does.  The last time you were here your blood pressure was high.  It was really high.  I just saw you back in July and your blood pressure was really high.
PATIENT: But I think I over drank that day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know what I mean and when I came in I was still like uh, I guess like still intoxicated but not intoxicated but.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I felt like a hangover in other words.
DOCTOR: Yeah so that's probably what brought it up a little bit.  I think if its, where is it most of the time.  The majority of the time you check it where is it at?
PATIENT: But you know what, okay you know like 119, maybe 130.
DOCTOR: Okay.  That's okay.
PATIENT: Sometimes 140 you know something like that.
DOCTOR: If that's the case I would say stick with the two that you're on.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: If it's routinely going below 90 or even below 100 then I'd probably stop at least one of them.  I know you stopped the amlodipine.  Let me ask you; is it hard for you to get here for appointments?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: So how about we do this.  Keep taking both of them, take them regularly.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Every day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We'll have you come back in two weeks just for a blood pressure check.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Just to see if you are too low when you're taking them regularly we could probably stop one of them.
PATIENT: Yeah because I would have to stay on them for two weeks I know and then we could go from there you know that sounds like a good plan cause.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm a little confused.  Sometimes I take them sometimes I don't.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I don't even know if it's the medicine, maybe it's just me, I don't know.
DOCTOR: Yeah so let's do that.  Take them regularly every day for the next two weeks and then I'll have you come back for a blood pressure check with one of the nurses.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we'll have that in the computer and we'll see how it looks.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Sounds good to me I'll just come in.
DOCTOR: Otherwise I saw you uh, they're seeing you in the Urology Clinic now is that right?
PATIENT: Well GU yes.
DOCTOR: Diagnosis is prostate cancer?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay so you're getting treatment for that.
PATIENT: Well right.  We made a game plan.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The last time I seen them.
DOCTOR: What’s the plan.
PATIENT:
DOCTOR: whatever.
DOCTOR: Yeah DOCTOR.
PATIENT: DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: So what's the plan?
PATIENT: Okay uh you know what I had the biopsy done and the specimens were detected here at the VA only the right side.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Of the paperwork they give me the right side.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So my sister-in-law wrote to a pathologist in Houston.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I sent the specimens, well the VA sent the specimens to their office or whatever and they ran their tests and they found that the VA had missed cancer on the left side also.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So that changed all my numbers.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And so now the doctor is saying, see I'm getting married in April.
DOCTOR: Oh congrats.
PATIENT: Yeah so you know we've been together 25 years so I'm getting married in April and I didn't want, he wanted to do the surgery next month you know in March, the 8th or something and I'm going well I want to get married I don't want to be stuck you know for six weeks healing you know and I don't even know what, I don't know there's a lot of side effects and you know I don't know if I want to fall into one of them side effects.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And have.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: So I just keep, what he did was give me a shot in my stomach.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: To prolong the cancer or whatever.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And uh and scheduled me in three months to see him again or within the three, February, March, April, somewhere in May have the surgery or whatever I decide to do you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: As far as the chemo or surgery.
DOCTOR: Perfect.  So we're gonna do the shot and that'll keep you good for three months.
PATIENT: I already did that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I did that already.
DOCTOR: And then we can talk surgery at that point.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Perfect.
PATIENT: Either talk surgery or whatever I decide to do.
DOCTOR: Possible options.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: Now I spoke to him about the robotic because of the side effects, less potential side effects.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: And um but the VA don't do it here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So he gave me something.  I don't know maybe there's a VA somewhere around here that might do that I don't know.
DOCTOR: There's one out by Loyola, in Maywood, Hines.  I don't know, see that's the thing I'm not sure, I would maybe try giving them a call.
PATIENT: I could call them?
DOCTOR: Yeah no actually I'm not sure who does it I would maybe even ask the GU Clinic.
PATIENT: Yeah she gave me a VA.com type of deal to get on the internet and go to the computer route.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If they do something like that at the VA you know.  I don't feel like going on the outside.  I've been here.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: Through the years and.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Everybody knows what's going on with me.  I go over there and I got to start this whole story all over again.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Tests and.
DOCTOR: Better [REDACTED] to go to one place.
PATIENT: I'll probably.
DOCTOR: Okay yeah.
PATIENT: I'm more satisfied you know.
DOCTOR: Gotcha.  Alright well good.  As long as they're following for all that stuff.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I just wanted to make sure you to have someone here.
PATIENT: Yeah what they send me an appointment with the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Uh to check the testosterone?
PATIENT: Cause it was low before they found out my PSA levels were low okay and that's why I was having this erection problem or whatever so but they told me that uh, how do you call it that if they treat the testosterone levels that that would advance the cancer because whatever they give you.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] yeah you know in people with prostate cancer already I don't think they want to treat that number just yet they probably want to treat the cancer first.
PATIENT: Well that's the way I'm doing it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But see they set me up for another appointment.  I guess I'll just go ahead and keep it.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And at that time just let them know what's going on.  I image they know too because that's one of the questions they asked me the last time I was there, well you have this prostate cancer and that's how I found out that if they treated the testosterone levels that that would affect my cancer.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So that was like on hold.
DOCTOR: I gotcha yeah.  Take care of the cancer first.  I mean it sounds like there's a good game plan in place.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I would just treat that first.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Otherwise I mean it sounds like you're doing well.  The hip pain as long as it's controlled on the Vicodin I wouldn't worry too much about it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I can refill that for you today.
PATIENT: Okay alright.
DOCTOR: Um the blood pressure I guess we'll have you come back in two weeks.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: To get it rechecked.
PATIENT: That'll be fine.
DOCTOR: Uh and it looks like you're due for a colonoscopy next year.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Um and then let me check when we checked your labs last in terms of your cholesterol and everything.
PATIENT: I think that was done last year too in February you know cause they go through a whole procedure.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Before a surgery.
DOCTOR: So they were done, the last thing I see in here is from March 2011 in terms of your cholesterol um looks okay.  Are you on, you're not on anything for?
PATIENT: No I just take a stomach pill for acid reflux, reflux or whatever.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay alright.  You want to sit up here for me?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll take a listen.  Just normal breathing okay.  Actually, I'm just going to go just right under here.
PATIENT: Oh.

DOCTOR: Alright.  So here's what we're gonna do.  Pretty much exactly what we talked about.  I'm gonna refill your meds.  Do you want to pick them up here or do you want them to come in the mail?
PATIENT: I could pick them up here.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So.
PATIENT: Oh one other thing um.
DOCTOR: Sure.
PATIENT: I think my Viagra is also running out or something or other.  I might need to.
DOCTOR: Uh you still got a refill on that.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So you can just, when you stop by the Pharmacy just tell them you have a refill on it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay um and then what I'll do I'll refill your Vicodin and your blood pressure medicine.  I think everything else has got refills on it so um we're gonna have you come back in two weeks for that blood pressure check.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um did you eat anything today?
PATIENT: No I drank a cup of coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When you come back in for the blood pressure check if you can come in the morning.  I want to recheck your cholesterol levels.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: We don't want you to eat or drink anything before that if possible.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I figure maybe when you come back for the blood pressure check just stop by the Lab too and get that drawn.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: That sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay.  Uh so don't eat anything after 12 that night?
DOCTOR: Well.
PATIENT: You like preparing for whatever.

PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I was still drinking it at 9 o'clock so right when I got here basically.
DOCTOR: You know it should be okay.  You could stop by the Lab today if you want and just get that.  Cause your blood pressure meds you usually probably take with food right?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah so I don't want you to you know go hungry when you're taking your blood pressure meds that day um you could just stop by the Lab today and you can get it done if you want.
PATIENT: I'll just wait the two weeks that way I'll be prepared you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: If I have to, do you suggest I eat something or nothing?
DOCTOR: Uh I mean ideally, ideally nothing but.
PATIENT: Okay well then that's fine.
DOCTOR: If you need something with your blood pressure medicine you know.
PATIENT: Uh I don't really, sometimes I do, sometimes I don't maybe just a piece of toast or something you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  If you take something small, just don't eat too much.
PATIENT: Okay, I gotcha.
DOCTOR: Okay the blood pressure check in two weeks and then other than that I'll see you back, what do you think six months sound good?
PATIENT: Fine with me.  I mean after they take care of this cancer I should be good.
DOCTOR: Should be good to go.  Let me just uh refill this and put in a couple other things for you and then we'll have you on your way okay.
