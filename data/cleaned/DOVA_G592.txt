DOCTOR: PATIENT.
PATIENT: I'm right here.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll come back here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Right across the way there.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's on your left or on your right side, down here to the right.  We last saw each other back like in April or so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then looking at the notes you've been here a couple times in the interim at Urgent Care for uh testicular pain, URI symptoms.  How is that stuff doing now?
PATIENT: I've got some still coughing.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I need to find out why I'm coughing instead of somebody giving me a pump to open up the airways, I’m not interested in that. And my [REDACTED] but my back is giving problems.
DOCTOR: Still bothering you.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think I just.
DOCTOR: So how long total have you been coughing for now, would you say how many months?
PATIENT: I'd say I been probably since the last time I come over here.
DOCTOR: Since April?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Oh.  Since so, I saw you in April.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: We talked about your back and your diabetes and then you came into the Urgent Care in May.
PATIENT: For coughing.
DOCTOR: Uh your stomach hurt and then uh in July it looks like you came in with four days of a nonproductive cough, runny nose and sore throat and that was back in July and so are you still.
PATIENT: No I didn't tell them, I come here, I was coughing, I told them I was coughing and it was a dry cough.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I didn't tell them nothing about my nose running.
DOCTOR: So how many months would you say it's been going on for then total?
PATIENT: I'd say it's been going on for four months.
DOCTOR: Four months okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Dry cough and what seems to bring it about?
PATIENT: I don't know just sometimes I just start coughing.
DOCTOR: No known triggers, so it's not like um, is there something you can think of in terms of time of day, exposure to potential allergens?
PATIENT: Well sometimes it's at night.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And sometimes in the daytime, sometimes it's at night.  I drink water sometime and that helps but I just start coughing and like.
DOCTOR: Any history of acid reflux or heartburn?
PATIENT: No, no doctor's ever told me.
DOCTOR: Do you ever experience after you eat that you get a burning in your chest at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Any history of um postnasal drip or feeling anything drip down the back of your throat?
PATIENT: Well you know but I think you know my first instinct is I think I may have sinus.
DOCTOR: What did you think that?
PATIENT: Sometime, just according to the weather, sometimes my nostrils sometimes start just dripping.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that's the reason I think I because years ago I didn't wear a hat and it could be ever so cold outside and I didn't put nothing on my head so I think that I might have some kind of sinus cause most of my work, I work with the airlines so most of my work for at least 15 years was outside.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let me just see if we ever did any.  I mean I guess you could argue that after four months we should think about getting a chest x-ray.  Do you have a significant smoking history?
PATIENT: I never smoked in my life.
DOCTOR: Good.  And then - cause you don't have . . . and uh the lisinopril, how long have you been on this?  Do you feel like when you started taking the lisinopril back in April is that around when your cough started?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Or had you been on that before? To treat your blood pressure.  So you had been on [REDACTED] and we changed you over to lisinopril.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And so do you feel like, is that around the time when your cough started when they changed those medications around?
PATIENT: Well.
DOCTOR: Certain people, sometimes lisinopril can cause people to have a cough.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Do you feel that's when the cough started?
PATIENT: Well I knew I started coughing but why I started coughing I don't know.
DOCTOR: Yeah but do you feel [REDACTED] that those were related?
PATIENT: Well I really can't say.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Definitely something to think about.  And how much is this cough bothering you?  Is it a lot?
PATIENT: Well it concerns me that I'm coughing.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I'm, you know, I’m deeply concerned about the coughing so I was recently in a program, a medical program here in Chicago and the head doctor here in Chicago, I think its DOCTOR.
DOCTOR:
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT:
DOCTOR: said that people are usually coughing like that he said that it could be some other problems that is affecting the body and they should do tests.
DOCTOR: Okay, no you're absolutely, you're absolutely right.  And I may just have this piece of paper [REDACTED] just grab this.  Okay.  Okay yeah, so you're right.  So we are going to investigate this.  We probably should just get a chest x-ray since it's been going on for so long but it could very well be either as simple as seasonal allergies, especially a bit of congestion versus um taking the lisinopril can often induce a cough uh in people so then we could just switch you to another medicine so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll do some of those things.  You could just get the chest x-ray today cause if you're concerned you might as well just get the chest x-ray so they can prove that there’s nothing serious going on then everybody can sleep a little bit easier.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we can do that.  Let's see we can do that today, I'll set you up.  And so the other things we talked about um last time you were here was your diabetes, we talked about it for a while.  Because when you were seen back in April your diabetes was pretty poorly controlled so how have your sugars been at home since then?
PATIENT: Well, I consider myself doing a pretty good job of controlling that.
DOCTOR: What kind of numbers are we getting with our glucometer?
PATIENT: Well the numbers is sometimes right on the borderline for me but like I say, like I told you before I don't eat uh, I don't eat nothing that has sugar in it.  I don't put a lot of salt or nothing on there and I'm eating smaller portions of food.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Okay.  I do eat a little bit more, instead of eating once or twice or three times a day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I might eat four times.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: You know but I eat smaller portions.
DOCTOR: But what kind of numbers are you getting like you know first thing in the morning for example.  Before you eat breakfast what kind of reading have you been getting in your blood sugars?
PATIENT: Well I'm getting under 200s.  I'm getting 100s to 200s [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: We want them between 90 and 125 ideally.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So it's better than above 200.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Hopefully but it's not quite where we want it.  So next time, if you could even bring your glucometer in that would also be helpful so we could go through it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Together, so we're gonna check your A1c today to see how that is doing and what kind of numbers are you getting after meals would you say?
PATIENT: Well?
DOCTOR: How many times a day are you checking your sugars?
PATIENT: I'm only checking them one time.
DOCTOR: Okay and that's usually first thing in the morning before breakfast?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's fine, but yeah that means that we got a and certainly if you're doing your part with the uh eating habits [REDACTED] getting you on some better medicines and it looks like you're supposed to be taking now the glipizide 20 mg twice a day, perfect.  okay and why aren't you on metformin? Have you ever taken metformin?
PATIENT: Metformin had an affect on the kidneys.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] so that's perfect okay.  So it was making me something crazy for why you weren't on it and it looks like um let's see and concerning your blood pressure are you checking your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: What kind of numbers are you getting?
PATIENT: I've been getting real good numbers because I was a little upset when I saw she had over there.
DOCTOR: 131/77.
PATIENT: No she had the first number.
DOCTOR: 143/82 yeah.
PATIENT: Right and I told her for me to wait for a few minutes and take it over again.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And probably if you would take it now it's probably lower because I get a little excited when I come to the doctor's office.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh and what have you been getting at home?
PATIENT: I been getting uh I been getting something like the other day I got 68/123.
DOCTOR: Great.
PATIENT: Numbers like that.
DOCTOR: Good 120/68.  So blood pressure, that sounds like you're doing really great, excellent.
PATIENT: But they done told me you know that uh the blood pressure if it stays up high it would do damage to my organs.
DOCTOR: Exactly.
PATIENT: So they told me they wanted to get it down to the lower levels and that's why I've been really working on it.
DOCTOR: Good, that's really good.
PATIENT: And I have lost weight too doc.
DOCTOR: Let's see, your cover sheet here, yeah wow you've lost seven pounds.  What do you attribute this too, just trying to eat smaller portions?
PATIENT: I been just eating smaller portions.  I don't eat late at night.
DOCTOR: Great.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Wow.
PATIENT: After about 9 o'clock at night I don't have no food.  I just drink a lot of water now.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: I don't drink pop but I never have been a big pop drinker.
DOCTOR: Excellent.
PATIENT: I do drink a little orange juice.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: About 4 ounces a day, in the morning, because of the potassium.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Well 7 pounds, you know losing it like a healthy rate also it's not like you know this is gonna be a sustainable change for you, that's excellent, that's really great.  And did they tell you about the results of your colonoscopy already?  So basically, they saw a polyp that did not indicate cancer, um but these types of polyps can turn into cancer, they would want to get a repeat on you in five years.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So but nothing scary now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So you're wrapped up with that and then so tell me about this back pain, what's gonna happen now?
PATIENT: Well the back pain I had a.
DOCTOR: I know we talked before that you had um you know a herniated disk.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And that you had tried some physical therapy and how do you feel that things are going since you were here last?
PATIENT: Well I'm still having, still having back problems uh.  I guess some of it I should have been over here in the gym taking therapy.  I'm used to taking exercise over in the gym.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They do have a facility over here I can come and take exercise.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm tending to think some of it was my fault for not getting up and getting over here taking exercise.
DOCTOR: So how far do you live?  How far north or south of here is Warren?
PATIENT: Uh one block past Madison.
DOCTOR: Oh so you don't live that far.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay yeah so if you lived like way on the north or on the south side then yeah.  Maybe you should just come in for physical therapy.  It looks like they tried to allegedly contact you a couple times um but basically if we want to send you to you know the back surgeons or anything we have to document that you've done three months of physical therapy here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So let's just go ahead and put that back in, let's give it a whirl.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let's see what happens and do need any Tylenol or any?
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: Okay good.
PATIENT: I'm not really for taking a lot of medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, good.  And we can also give you in addition to physical therapy there's a gym here um if you want a referral for that.
PATIENT: Oh I'd like to go to your gym.
DOCTOR: Yes, let me put in Recreation Therapy.  Oh yeah you live so close, [REDACTED] I'll put in for a referral, that's in.  Okay.  Good.  [REDACTED] and then let’s see what’s on our reminder list, I'll send a reminder, so did they give you your TDAP today or [REDACTED] tetanus shot.  Are you amenable to getting a tetanus shot today?
PATIENT: Yes I'll take the tetanus.
DOCTOR: Okay perfect.  We'll put this in, that was ordered.
PATIENT: Put in a chest x-ray.
DOCTOR: Yeah you're gonna go do that after we're done here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's about it.  Good, excellent and let's see here so you've already seen the eye doctors and let's see they don't need to see you back for a year from last time.  Oh here we go, oh uh they want to see you nine months after the first time so that's fine.  So it sounds like the main things that we're gonna do today are um so we'll try to stop this cough and see if there's any changes we should make to your medications to get your blood sugar under better control cause all you are on now for your diabetes right is the max dose of the glipizide and we don't have any diabetes labs since you were here last time.  Okay so do you get any low blood sugars like where you get dizzy, sweaty? Okay.  So let me just wash my hands and I’ll take a listen here.  And before you started seeing us here in April had you been taking any medicines for your diabetes previously or no?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You were already on the glipizide at that point?
PATIENT: Yes ma'am.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay.  Your lungs sound clear okay.  So let me see, so besides doing a chest x-ray let's see how many things we're gonna change today okay.  I'm going to talk to DOCTOR I'll be back in just a couple minutes.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  41:26  DOCTOR IN:  52:05)
DOCTOR: Alright here's what we're gonna do.  We're gonna do a couple things.  So the first thing is we're gonna change your medications around a little bit.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then we can get your chest x-ray done today so I'm gonna add another medicine for your diabetes, it's called Actos and it's just a pill you take once a day, [REDACTED] no needles [REDACTED] you're now gonna be taking you know two pills in the morning or like.
PATIENT: Three pills a day.
DOCTOR: Yeah and then still just your two pills at night.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'm gonna add this in and then keep checking your sugars and if you do find yourself getting you know hypoglycemic, sweaty, lightheaded, dizzy and you know sugars below 80s then stop taking the new medicine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So let me put that in.  [REDACTED] okay.  We're good and then I'm also gonna change so you've been on Benicar before for your blood pressure and they switched you over to lisinopril.  Lisinopril can frequently give people a cough and usually Benicar won't so we're just gonna switch you back to the Benicar that you were on when you came in here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: They put you on the lisinopril because it was cheaper, it was on the VA formulary but the cough is a very, very common reason for people to be switched over to Benicar.  And it looks like when you were seen here we weren't sure they had put you on that but that's totally fine so we will put that in and we'll take the lisinopril out medicines so perfect.  So we'll put you on Losartan because it's in the same class of medications.  It works the same way as lisinopril but it usually doesn't cause a cough okay.
PATIENT: So discontinue the lisinopril?
DOCTOR: Right you're gonna pick up this new medicine at the window instead.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Try this out and we'll see how it does.  So we're gonna have you pick that up but the very, very first thing um we're gonna do is to have you go get that chest x-ray.  So let me just change it to stat so what we're gonna do is you're just gonna go get the chest x-ray done right now and then you'll just wait out here, I'll tell you that it's normal and then I'll have you go to the Pharmacy.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll just that way that will be off of our chest as it were and then we'll everything with that is good and then we'll also have you go down to the Lab today so we can look at your A1c.  We'll look at your blood glucose control for the past three months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So the two things we're gonna do now is um I'm actually going to get your TDAP right now so we'll put in the order.
PATIENT: Give you a copy of that.
DOCTOR: The yeah, so you're gonna do three things um right now.  We are gonna do, we're gonna have the nurse give you a shot.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You're gonna go down to X-Ray and get that x-ray.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You're gonna go to the Lab and get some blood drawn and just wait up here, I'll tell you everything looks great and then you're gonna go to the Pharmacy.
PATIENT: Okay they can take, when they draw the blood they can give you the results right away?
DOCTOR: No unfortunately the blood sugar for the past three months is gonna take a couple days to come back.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But I can certainly give you a call when it comes back and the chest x-ray we're gonna have you back here for the results cause we'll have it back within an hour.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So let's walk you over to the nurses' desk.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um it's just right here.  Just have a seat in here sir.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and then you're just going to go down to the X-Ray and the Lab and then just wait out here and we'll let you know what the x-ray shows.
PATIENT: Thank you ma'am.
DOCTOR: Thank you.
PATIENT: 57:43.
