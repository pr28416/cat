PATIENT: Yeah I'll go up there, but that still on the, no that's on the fifth floor ain't it.
DOCTOR: I'm not exactly sure.
PATIENT: Yeah I think it is.  It's about time for me to get a foot doctor, see the foot doctor too.
DOCTOR: You saw him in February and.
PATIENT: I saw the foot doctor in February?
DOCTOR: You actually saw, who did you see, you saw a nurse at the Foot Clinic.
PATIENT: Yeah that's uh.
DOCTOR: You saw the foot doctor in November.  Yeah they wanted you to come back as well so we can schedule that too.
PATIENT: Foot doctor okay, that's on the 7th floor.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Now in [REDACTED]@, you had a colonoscopy um let's see.  You haven't noticed any blood in your stool or black tarry stool or weight loss or anything like that?
PATIENT: The only time I see blood in the stool is when I'm going to pass and it's too hard my hemorrhoids.
SECOND PERSON X848
[REDACTED].
PATIENT: You know the hemorrhoids but after that.
DOCTOR: Cause what I'm trying to figure out if you've had your colonoscopy in [REDACTED]@ uh about six years ago showed a couple polyps and they were removed and they were the least dangerous kind of polyps but at that time your, the doctors thought you might, the colonoscopy doctor thought you might need to get a repeat colonoscopy yet last year or this year you know depending on how your overall health is.  I think your overall health is pretty good um.  You've got some heart disease but um you know you're lungs are okay.  I think you should, would be able to tolerate a colonoscopy um, if that's something you wished to pursue.
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: No okay.
PATIENT: That's the thing they go up your rectum.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: No I don't want to go through that no more.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I think that's reasonable.  I mean you're 84, you're pretty healthy.  The benefits would be catching a cancer early um.  If you notice any unexplained weight loss, fevers, chill, you know, sweats, weight loss anything like that or if you notice?
PATIENT: Sweats.
DOCTOR: Your stool changing.  Huh.
PATIENT: I sweat all the time.
DOCTOR: Like unexplained sweats or weight loss.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay uh, so your weight's been pretty stable.  So or if you notice tarry stool and it would be black like the color of this um.  Let me take a listen to you.  Deep breath and I'll listen to your heart.  Would you be willing to get some blood work done today, checking your A1c, your diabetes?
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: Would you be willing to check some blood today?
PATIENT: It don't matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright.  I think we should check that um, let me talk with DOCTOR and you'll be all set okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  25:18  DOCTOR IN:  28:21)
DOCTOR: Alright, you're all set um give this to them up front and we're just gonna check that diabetes lab.  We'll get you to the eye doctors and foot doctors.

PATIENT: Okay uh now you don't, the pharmacist got this?
DOCTOR: Yeah I put that in, see its right here.
PATIENT: Okay cause I don't want to go down there and be sitting out there waiting.
