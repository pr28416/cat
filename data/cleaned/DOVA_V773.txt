DOCTOR: PATIENT?  How are you sir?
PATIENT: Good how you doing?
DOCTOR: Good.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You the doctor?
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: A new one.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: A new one, every year I come here I get a new doctor.
DOCTOR: Yeah, sorry about that.  I'm going to stay uh.  [REDACTED].  My name is [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I'm one of the residents here um.  I'm going to stay for three years so.
PATIENT: Oh well I have you a couple more years then huh.
DOCTOR: So, I'll be seeing you a few more times if you come in every year.  Um okay so PATIENT I looked at the chart.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So that I'll tell you what I know so far.  Uh I see you have hypertension and you have some high sugars; otherwise you're doing fine basically.  Your weight is a little; you're overweight so I think we're working on the weight.  Um yeah so that's all I know so far.
PATIENT: Well this I got from my foot doctor okay.  Every, I don't know four, five, six months I get a little flare-up on the gout.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I'm going down to Florida.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: In another couple of months but I don't want to go down without my medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I went to her to get the prescription renewed.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Just so when I get down there I don't have to hunt around for a doctor if I have a flare.
DOCTOR: Okay sure.
PATIENT: And you know try and get the medicine and uh right off she told me to give this to my doc when I go there for my physical and I don't know what, I didn't read it.
DOCTOR: Oh so this is the lab.
PATIENT: This uh.
DOCTOR: It's uh January.
PATIENT: 7 uh yeah.
DOCTOR: Recent lab.
PATIENT: Yeah I just went in January.
DOCTOR: Okay so that's, okay.
PATIENT: Anyway and then last time I was here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: They said my blood pressure was a little bit high so they give me one of these light sort of things and they said to keep track of it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay so this morning when I took it, it was 125/68.
DOCTOR: Oh great, you have book here?
PATIENT: Oh yeah I got a plan.
DOCTOR: Awesome thank you.
PATIENT: It's high and then it goes low and then they put me on different pills and that doesn't work.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's generally high I would say.  You decided not to take it too much?
PATIENT: No I been taking the same thing.  They keep giving me different pills to take.
DOCTOR: What pill are you taking right now?
PATIENT: I'm taking three of them.
DOCTOR: Okay let me ask which ones.
PATIENT: Well lisinopril here I'll find them.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20 mg?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Every day?
PATIENT: Every day I take all three of them in the morning.
DOCTOR: And then you take thiazide 25 mg.
PATIENT: Uh yep.
DOCTOR: Okay and amlodipine 10 mg.
PATIENT: Yeah I cut the pill in half.  That one I cut in half.  The 25 uh.
DOCTOR: The [REDACTED] you cut it in half right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So your blood pressure is still high a little bit today so.
PATIENT: Yeah but it'll go high just driving over here thinking about coming to this place.
DOCTOR: I know, I know.  So what I am going to do is I'm going to check on my own and check another one.
PATIENT: Let me ask you something.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Instead of keep, see every doctor I used to get, see I come back here once a year for my physical so every new doctor I get wants to change things.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Now the first time I went here, when I go back to 2006 when I first started coming here.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: My blood pressure's just a little bit high.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I got one pill, works fine and I come in the next year, I got a new doctor, now he says well let's try this, well let's try that, let's tweak this, let's tweak that.  Now he's got me taking two pills.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: The next year I come in, now he's got me taking three pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know, I don't understand what the hell is going on here to be honest with you.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So like I say everybody wants to change everything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know the old concern if it ain't broke don't fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Why did they begin changing my medicine to begin with?
DOCTOR: Okay.  So, it's not because they want to change them or anything.  If they don't need to change them I think they won't change.  So basically your blood pressure when you come in.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's uncontrolled.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So what that means um and although we add all the medication your blood pressure is not controlled.  So that means your blood pressure has worsened.  Though I think it's in the same range, we're adding the medication and you're still high, that means it's worsening.  That's why they added.
PATIENT: My blood pressure gets high just looking for a place to park out here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'm serious.  I mean it's just.  You drive around trying to find a place to park and you can't find a place to park.
DOCTOR: Yeah and then you get angry [REDACTED].
PATIENT: You know and I say Jesus Christ.
DOCTOR: I know what you're saying.
PATIENT: That's uh, I don't know I guess.
DOCTOR: I know what you're saying sir.  Okay.
PATIENT: Well I guess what I'm asking can they condense everything into one pill?
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: They got you on good medications.  If we can do that, we like to do that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But no, that's not possible.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: There are some combination pills.  Like two of the drugs you are taking.  There's a combination pill that will have both of them.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But if you're on a good dose, um you need to take three pills and it's not until you get a [REDACTED] dose that we know that this is the right dose.  We can't titrate it if it's a combination pill, so we can't go up on one and we can't go up on one so usually we like to use um like single dose, single medication pills.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Until we get a good control okay.  And then what I'm seeing right now is that if.
PATIENT: See I can go home and I can do it in another couple hours and take my own blood pressure with the.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Machine they gave me and it'd be normal.
DOCTOR: Do you the normal range of the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yeah they tell me they wanted to keep it down around 140 or below.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: It’s those I get when I'm at home.
DOCTOR: Well okay, so today your blood pressure initially when we checked was 156 alright and then it came down to 148 when we took again.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I'm going to take it again.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's probably high now.
DOCTOR: Let me see.
PATIENT: Let me take off my shirt.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you exercise?
PATIENT: Do I exercise?  Not really.
DOCTOR: Not really.  So exercise.
PATIENT: This morning I was out shoveling.
DOCTOR: Exercises are good for blood pressure.
PATIENT: I take a walk every day.  So I walk down, I get my.
DOCTOR: About how long do you walk?
PATIENT: 20 minutes maybe.
DOCTOR: Yeah that's good.  Every day?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh that's good.
PATIENT: I walk down and get the paper and oh I still work part-time on and off.
DOCTOR: So if you could put your arms here good.  Just relax.  It is 140/65, a little better.
PATIENT: Going down.
DOCTOR: Yes sir.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So.
PATIENT: I just gotta calm myself down.
DOCTOR: Yeah, try to calm down.  Part of it could be diet and then you exercise 20 minutes a day.
PATIENT: Yeah like I say I go out for a walk every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So and who do you live with?
PATIENT: Pardon?
DOCTOR: Who do you live with?
PATIENT: My son.
DOCTOR: Your son and uh do you have any family members who have had significant medical problems before?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Stroke, early heart attack, cancer?  Good and you have no allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: And these three are the only medications you're taking right now?
PATIENT: That's it.  The only other one, like I say if I get a little flare-up of the gout.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I take the.
DOCTOR: When did you get the flare-up last time?
PATIENT: Oh it's been a few months.  It's uh probably been four or five months.
DOCTOR: Okay and uh.
PATIENT: Like I say, you know I could go along.
DOCTOR: Where do you get the pain?
PATIENT: On the gout?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Usually around my ankle you know.  I did get it once in my elbow.
DOCTOR: The ankle or elbow okay and then how many times of flare-ups did you have so far in your life?
PATIENT: In my life since I've, oh I don't know.
DOCTOR: A lot?
PATIENT: No, no.  Like I say.
DOCTOR: More than 10?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: About 5?
PATIENT: Yeah probably around five.
DOCTOR: Okay and uh for the last approximately one year, how many times did you have a flare-up?
PATIENT: Last year, I'd say once.
DOCTOR: Once okay alright.
PATIENT: Like I say and the only reason, I don't know again, without having the bottle with me.  I don't know what, she wrote down what I got on here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, okay.
PATIENT: Uh.  I don't know if she wrote it down there, wouldn't know if I seen it anyway.  But it's a little blue-greenish pills.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know and like I say, if I get it right away, if I feel it coming and I get it right away.
DOCTOR: It goes uh, goes away.
PATIENT: I take a couple of these pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Before I go to bed or during the day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Then I take a couple you know.  I take maybe four of them.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it's usually gone overnight.
DOCTOR: And uh when you took the blood pressure today, did you eat this morning, you didn't eat yet this morning?
PATIENT: I haven't eaten nothing since last night.  They told me to fast.
DOCTOR: Okay thank you so much.  So for the next time when you come um you can fast and then before you see me.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You can get labs that's fine.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: I need the blood pressure readings okay.
PATIENT: Yeah they said I needed blood so don't eat nothing after midnight.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: So that's, you know I'm sorry about that.  We have to do that when we do your cholesterol level.
PATIENT: Oh that's no big deal.
DOCTOR: But um you can eat lunch after you leave okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: After we do blood tests.  So it's just for little blood test, it's not to see me.  Okay um and that's, that.  Your lipid levels look fine.  You're not taking any medication and this level is very good. Um your sugar is a little on the high side, that will cause diabetes okay.
PATIENT: How high is high?
DOCTOR: So your sugar is, you didn't eat anything and your sugar was 125, blood sugar.
PATIENT: What's normal?
DOCTOR: So normal if you're fasting I would see around under 100.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So that means you have a little bit of resistance to the insulin that you give for the sugar so that means that I would say pre-diabetic.  So if you continue to be, continue this lifestyle or to continue the same foods, uh soon you'll become diabetic.  So as your primary care doctor I would like prevent that.
PATIENT: So what do you got to do, lay off the sweets?
DOCTOR: Yeah definitely.  So no sweets um pop, do you drink a lot of pop?
PATIENT: No I don't drink pop.
DOCTOR: How about cola or coke?
PATIENT: No.  I don't drink much pop.  Well once in a great while I'll have a pop.  Mostly, I've been drinking a little of that flavored water.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: I drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Okay that sounds good, that's not too bad.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Um but do you?
PATIENT: Once in a while Gatorade.
DOCTOR: Gatorade um, just once in a while is fine um.  Do you eat a lot of sweet stuff like um I don't know cookies or?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So that's definitely something you cut down on.  If you can do that, do you eat it every day?
PATIENT: No not every day.
DOCTOR: So once every few days?
PATIENT: Yeah you know once every few days I.
DOCTOR: Okay well if you could reduce that to once every week and uh what kind of foods do you have?  Do you eat a lot of meats and stuff or?
PATIENT: Well yeah.
DOCTOR: Hamburgers?
PATIENT: Hamburger.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so if you could stop, I mean reduce the, I don't think you can stop it but if you can reduce the amounts maybe you can eat some fish for a change, eat some more vegetables, eat some more fruit, those kinds of diet is something you want to follow.
PATIENT: No candy huh?
DOCTOR: No candy, no candy, no candy and then.
PATIENT: How about peanuts or something like that or?
DOCTOR: Peanuts are good but um, if you eat too much peanuts, they're very salty.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that raises your blood pressure.  You have two things, you have to eat [REDACTED] salt and you have to watch out for sugar.  So the salty stuff is like potato chips, um if you eat chips with hamburgers.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Hamburgers can have a lot of salt in there um, uh let's see, let's see, what else do you eat, I can't think of the salty stuff.
PATIENT: Uh I don't know.  I do put salt on some stuff.  I don't put a lot but just enough to flavor it a little bit.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So don't put salt.
PATIENT: Don't put salt.
DOCTOR: Or just put a little bit.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Because that kind of thing can make your blood pressure [REDACTED] definitely.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and what I see from the blood test is I'd say you're pre-diabetic.  You're not diabetic but your.
PATIENT: I'm borderline?
DOCTOR: Borderline, you're borderline.  You're getting to it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And we want to prevent that and uh your kidney function has been a little higher than normal person.  I think you know that?
PATIENT: Yeah well [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Something called creatinine; we measure it to see your kidney functions.
PATIENT: Through my blood?
DOCTOR: Yeah through your blood.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And that's been a little high but and it [REDACTED].  That's most likely caused by hypertension in your case.  Usually the two major things that cause kidney issues.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Is hypertension and diabetes okay and in your case you're not diabetic.  A lot of diabetes people they go onto dialysis, you know that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: So initially we start seeing like a mild elevation of the kidney function, that's the first sign that we're injuring the kidneys and you're having that sign.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay and then the next thing you see is that you start leak some protein from the kidney and those are the bad signs that your kidney's not doing well.  Um your urine test you had today actually showed a little bit of protein so this is not good as well.  So but those things all come down to the um the same things, is good don't be diabetic and have your blood pressure in good control so that's the main kinds of treatment.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So that's why we were worried about your blood pressure.  If the blood pressure runs high all the time that can injury your kidney okay.
PATIENT: Okay.  So in other words now, I'm still on the same medication right?
DOCTOR: You're still on the same medications but I would say um, so keep away from salt definitely because that will raise your um blood pressure.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And as I said exercise helps.  So if you're walking 20 minutes that's great.  Maybe you can do 30 minutes a day um, yeah I think those things would help and then if you're stressed out, as you said the blood pressure can rise.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So stay away from stressors and uh have a good sleep, have a good sleep and good cycle of your life.
PATIENT: Good health.
DOCTOR: So I'd say, I recommend that.  Um your blood pressure is borderline high so if I see it, I would like to have it lower than this.  Uh normal range would be 140 and uh 140 is the systolic and the 90 is the diastolic but for people who are having some kidney issues, I would like to have it a little more lower.  So in your case I would like to aim a little lower.  So if I, I didn't know that you were upset about getting all the medication increased.
PATIENT: Oh know I was just curious because as I say every time I come in.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I have a different doctor and he'd want to say well let's tweak this or let's tweak that and.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know and I think well shit now I started out on one pill, now I'm on three pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah, that's not because they want to tweak it, it's because it's getting worse okay.  So we have to do something for that.  Let's see.  So the thiazide, I think we can go up.  So you're taking only half a pill of the thiazide right?
PATIENT: The little orange one?
DOCTOR: The orange one yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah I tell you that's the one I'm cutting in half.  Yeah I take a half a pill.
DOCTOR: So let's see, amlodipine you're maxed out.  Lisinopril you're not maxed out.  So we can either increase this one or this one.  Uh I think since you're cutting the pill in half, you can just take that whole pill every day.
PATIENT: Just take the whole pill of it.
DOCTOR: A whole pill every day and then since you're telling me that your blood pressure is high when you come into the hospital, I would like to have it checked for the next two weeks if you don't mind and could you come to the hospital to see my nurse so that we can recheck your blood pressure?
PATIENT: It'll be high.
DOCTOR: Oh you think it'll be high?
PATIENT: Just coming over here yeah, I start thinking about it and uh.
DOCTOR: Or you know you can check at home for two weeks and then show me the records that you have two weeks and we won't check here.
PATIENT: Alright, well like I say it's uh.  I don't care if they check it here and every time I come in here it's, like I say I checked it this morning and it was 126.
DOCTOR: Yeah because I see here, I see that you've been running high for me too.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Right so probably if we take the average you're on the high side.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So at home.  So I think that we will increase the medication if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Whatever.
DOCTOR: Alright so, so uh let's see.  I think we can definitely increase this one and then I'm thinking of increasing this one was well.
PATIENT: Which one is that?
DOCTOR: The lisinopril.
PATIENT: The lisinopril okay.
DOCTOR: So you can go up to 80 mg of lisinopril and then you can go up to 25 mg on the thiazide those are all maximum dose.  So and then um let's see and then you can come and see us in a month.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And uh you can, I don't know, you don't have to see me necessarily so you can just log in your blood pressure and you can come to see my nurse and then you can hand in the log that you have.
PATIENT: Yeah, well this one's full so, I'll have to keep checking on it.
DOCTOR: Right, usually do it for a time.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: So if you could give us a copy so that we can um uh, we can leave it in the hospital, one sheet of paper at the hospital that'd be.
PATIENT: Yeah okay yeah.
DOCTOR: That'd be easier for us.
PATIENT: Keep a copy of it.
DOCTOR: Yeah just in case so that we can, if I get that paper, I'll just put that into the computer so we can know where the blood pressure is running.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So let's do that in one month.  Um and your blood pressure issue is okay and then the other thing I wanted to ask was, you had a flu shot, your shots are up-to-date.
PATIENT: Well I was gonna stop and get a flu shot on the way out of here.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, you have that to do, you have a flu shot this year.  So you're going to get a flu shot today and then, how's your colonoscopy?  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Oh never?  So how old are, you're 58.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So probably you should have one.  Like everybody over 50 it is recommended.
PATIENT: Yeah I know and the last, you know I asked the doctor a couple years ago.  I had a little woman doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And she says you know I says I just don't really think about having one but she says you know if you get blood in your stool with a lot of blood or if it's black.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it hasn't been black and I don't, I haven't had any blood in my stools so.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So, but even if you don't have blood in your stools uh, everybody over 50 is recommended to do a scope.
PATIENT: Well I'm not really interested in having one right now.
DOCTOR: So the reason for this colonoscopy, colonoscopy is basically a camera.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: That goes in through the rectum.
PATIENT: Yeah I know.
DOCTOR: Okay so they're going to give you some sedation.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So that it won't be too painful.  The reason we do this is because you know that colon cancer is very prevalent in the United States, especially people who eat like American diets, high fatty foods and colon cancer, how it starts is like one small polyp, it starts with one small polyp and then as time goes, you know it grows, grows, grows and then it invades.  Invades, so if there's a colon here, it starts out like a tiny polyp.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then as time goes it grows, it grows okay and then it grows on this side too so instead of growing this side, there's a blood vessel coming into it.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So usually when this thing reaches the point that it goes to the blood vessel, you're in trouble because there's a chance of going to the other places in the colon okay.  If you find out the polyp when it's this small, it's going to be a very simple procedure, you're already in the colon with the camera, you just put in some stuff that you can cut off the polyp so you can just cut off the polyp and that's it.  If you find it this big, okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If you find it this big, it's too risky to go with the uh endoscopy procedure so in that case we need surgery.  What kind of surgery we do is that we resect the colon here to get a safe margin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: If you find it in this stage, when it goes into the bloodstream and goes to the other organs, basically surgery won't cure this.  If it's in the other organ it's going to be chemotherapy and the prognosis is going to be very bad.  So, the reason behind this is that if we find colon cancer in the early stage, it's just staying as a polyp and it's not, it's gonna be a very simple procedure and you won't get recurrence.  If you find, if you find it later, if you find it more later the risk of doing a surgery or not even getting the surgery increases.  So that is the rationale of doing this colonoscopy in everybody over 50 years old.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So we have a lot of patients that we just find a small polyp and we remove the polyp and every polyp that is removed is sent to the Pathology Lab.  They look in the microscope and they see if it's malignant or not and then there are polyps that we see, okay this has a potential to become malignant, it was great that we found it and we just removed it in a simple procedure and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'll have to think about it.
DOCTOR: Okay so if you could think about and you could let me know and uh, um yeah and then I can just schedule it okay.  So that's about it.
PATIENT: Uh could I pick up these medicines, this prescription today?
DOCTOR: Sure, sure, sure.  You have, you're running out of all medications?
PATIENT: Nah, no, see I got them all at different times.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So one's going to run out before the other two.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then the other one runs out and then.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: The orange pills I got all at once.
DOCTOR: So I'm going to refill all the medications okay.
PATIENT: Yeah and it's good for a year?
DOCTOR: Pardon?
PATIENT: How long is this prescription good for now?  How many fill-ups do I get?
DOCTOR: Your prescription?
PATIENT: Yeah.  See they give me enough for, like at 90 at a time so every, whenever I come up, every three months.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know I get, I got four refills.
DOCTOR: Sure I can do that.  I'm going to give you like three or four refills so that you won't have to worry.
PATIENT: Uh I'll keep track, I'll keep track of my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Then have you ever talked about an Advanced Directive and stuff?
PATIENT: A what?
DOCTOR: Advanced Directive and a Power of Attorney?
PATIENT: Oh I got that through my kids and that yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.  So you have the paperwork sent to the VA?
PATIENT: Do I have it done through the VA?  No.
DOCTOR: So you should read this, it's like authorization of what you want to do in the future.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: So you don't take any medication outside the VA?
PATIENT: No, like I say, the only thing I take is if I get a little flare-up of the gout.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But other than that, no I don't take nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Other than an aspirin once in a while for a headache or something.
DOCTOR: Okay and then um so there's another screening, uh people over 65, have you ever smoked before?
PATIENT: Yeah I quit about 22 years ago.
DOCTOR: So have you ever had a screening of the ultrasound of the abdomen?
PATIENT: Yeah they did that, I think the last time I was in here.
DOCTOR: Okay, they did it last time?
PATIENT: Yeah, I remember they took a ultrasound of my stomach and that.
DOCTOR: Okay and that was normal?
PATIENT: As far as I know, they never said nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see.
PATIENT: I think it was last year.
DOCTOR: I'll just see it and I'm sure it's going to be uh for it so, oh there is uh okay, so you're good, you're done.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: So no sugars huh, no sweets?
DOCTOR: No sweets, no salt.
PATIENT: And no salt.
DOCTOR: No salt.
PATIENT: Is pepper okay?
DOCTOR: There's the pneumonia vaccine if you want to do it.
PATIENT: I think I had that last time too.
DOCTOR: Last time too, okay, alrighty, that's good.  Okay so, I'll see you in six months is that okay?  Or is once a year fine with you?
PATIENT: No I think once a year is fine.  I come in to the VA, I spend the whole day here, I got other stuff to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so [REDACTED] better for you?
PATIENT: Did you want me to make an appointment for that blood pressure thing?
DOCTOR: Oh they're going to make that.
PATIENT: About a month you said.
DOCTOR: When you check out they're gonna make it.
PATIENT: Yeah I mean in about another month?
DOCTOR: Yeah about another month.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah and then at that time you have to bring the records of the blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Could you just sit down and I'll listen to your heart and stuff?
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: And I recommend keep working on your weight because losing your weight can help blood pressure be regular and also the sugar too.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So that's all connected, everything is connected, your food, your lifestyle.
PATIENT: You're taking all the good things away from me though.
DOCTOR: Yeah I know so I have to do that, it's my job so. Deep breath, breathe out, once more, breathe out, that's good.  Okay so okay so I'll talk to my boss.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then I'll come back here okay.
(DOCTOR OUT: 96:10  DOCTOR IN:  106:24)
DOCTOR: Let me call the Pharmacy.
PATIENT: Do you want me to keep taking this other medicine till I run out that I got now?
DOCTOR: Yeah, I'll talk to you about that.  [REDACTED].  (Doctor makes phone call)  Do you want to pick it up at the Pharmacy?
PATIENT: Yeah I'll pick it up as long as I'm here today.
DOCTOR: Okay.  (Doctor still on phone)  Okay, all the medications are done.
PATIENT: So you're saying no salt at all on anything or?
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] no salt right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If you can do no salt, I mean you put extra salt on the food?
PATIENT: Well like some places, just say McDonald's for instance, I know their fries they use a little packet of salt.
DOCTOR: They use a lot of salt.  They use a lot of salt.
PATIENT: You know like I say if I order French fries or something, I'll put a little bit of salt on that or.
DOCTOR: No, no, no.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: That's very bad.
PATIENT: That's bad.
DOCTOR: Yeah so that's very bad because they already have salt in there.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Then you're adding extra salt in it.
PATIENT: Okay.  No salt, no sugar.
DOCTOR: No salt, no sugar.
PATIENT: No sugar in the coffee or?
DOCTOR: It's possible, it's possible.  I would recommend getting used to no sugar.
PATIENT: No sugar and just milk or.  How about on cereal?
DOCTOR: On cereal, no, no, no, no.
PATIENT: No, no, no, no.
DOCTOR: No salt or anything.
PATIENT: No sugar.
DOCTOR: No sugar, no sugar, no sugar.
PATIENT: No sugar.
DOCTOR: So maybe you can work on that first, no sugar, no salt.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And after a while you can think about decreasing because like I told you, everything down the line is going to be horrible if you have hypertension and diabetes.
PATIENT: What's hypertension?  Is that high blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  We see a lot of those patients, initially, it's like you, you're just like having high blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Pre-diabetic and eventually when you end up in the hospital they have all the complications of diabetes so you can name everything and they have it, so if you have diabetes, you can lose your eyesight, can have dialysis because of the kidney problems.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: And then you have neuropathy so you don't feel anything in your legs or your hands and then sometimes that's painful and you get erectile dysfunction, you get difficulty in moving your GI tract after you eat and also because you don't have sensation, good sensation, you're at increased risk of infection and once you get an infection in the foot it's very difficult to treat.  When they go into the bone you have to amputate the foot.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So it's horrible, [REDACTED].   So if you can stop here and prevent that from happening, that's gonna be, I think that'll be a great thing so.  So today.
PATIENT: Start eating fish though huh?
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Today, what I changed today is um uh, I said I'm going to go up on lisinopril too but it seems like the Pharmacy won't allow me to go up on the lisinopril.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I'm just going to increase the thiazide, the pill that you're cutting into half.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  So I'll take one of those.
DOCTOR: Just start taking one of those and then the medication you want to pick up today is going to be the same pill.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: But um enough that you can take it every day.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Okay so like I gave you three refills and then you're going to come back in one month with your blood pressure log and if that is high I need to add another medication okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and then for your gout there's a medication that can prevent gout from happening.
PATIENT: They gave me that once before here but it didn't work.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: This goes back a few years, maybe three, four years.
DOCTOR: Well maybe, yeah I'm not sure but sometimes it doesn't work.
PATIENT: Is it a pill you gotta take every day?
DOCTOR: Yeah because of treatment, you've done this before or even people who are taking, it doesn't happen.  Um but still it decreases the risk that we know, we know that it decreases the risk.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Of happening so I think it’s reasonable to start that medication again.  We usually start in the lower dose and then we increase the dose as tolerated.  Um I'm going to check, I just added a uric acid level in your blood tests so that when the results come back and if it comes back and if it's high we'll increase the pills you're on.  This pill is only once a day, one tablet a day but you can increase to three pills a day if there's no issues.  Um so I'll let you know, I'll let you know about the results and uh I'll let you know if we're going to increase the medication or not but for now you can just take that one pill.
PATIENT: Well what happens if I get a flare-up of the gout, can I take this with the medicine that I'm taking?
DOCTOR: No this medication will prevent that, so if you get a flare-up this won't help.
PATIENT: So I could take the other pills that I've taken now for it?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah, the indomethacin.  Right, I probably, have you gotten indomethacin?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You can take that pill and if the pain is still uncontrolled you can call us and we'll give you other medications.
PATIENT: This is what I didn't want is all this medication for this and this cause I really don't understand how I had one pill you know, it's just you take a pill for this, a pill for this and a pill for this.
DOCTOR: So these three pills are for your blood pressure you know that right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And what I'm adding is just one pill; it's for preventing from the gout from happening okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Make sense?
PATIENT: I'll give it a try and see what happens.
DOCTOR: For now we'll see what happens okay.  So I'll see you in one year but um we're going to see my nurse in one month.
PATIENT: One month.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alrighty.
DOCTOR: Okay so you know how to check out right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I got to rid of this.
DOCTOR: Just give this to the check out.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Have a good day now.
PATIENT: You uh, now I can just go down to the Pharmacy and that stuff will be down in the Pharmacy?
DOCTOR: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay.  Alright thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Thank you very much sir.
