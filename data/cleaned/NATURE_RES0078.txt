DOCTOR: How may I help you?
PATIENT: I've been having difficulties breathing over these last few days.
DOCTOR: When did it start?
PATIENT: It started about, like, three or four days ago.
DOCTOR: OK, and since then, has it gotten any better or worse?
PATIENT: It has, maybe gotten a little bit worse, but not, maybe, a little worse.
DOCTOR: And are there certain times when you feel that you're more short of breath than other times? Anything in particular that you're doing that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Uhm, not really, it's kind of, I just feel like, it's just more difficult to breathe, uh, most of the time.
DOCTOR: And, has this happened to you before?
PATIENT: Uhm, not like, no, nothing like this has happened before.
DOCTOR: OK, do you have a history of any lung problems?
PATIENT: No, I don't, I've been healthy.
DOCTOR: So no COPD, no asthma, nothing like that,  right?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: OK, so you're just having difficulties breathing for the past three-four days. Do you have any, uh, do you have a cough?
PATIENT: I did have a, uh, yeah, I've had a cough as well, over these last few days.
DOCTOR: And has it been a dry cough or wet cough?
PATIENT: I've been bringing up, some, like, uh, whitish sputum. It's like, yeah, whitish or clear.
DOCTOR: And you haven't seen blood anytime right? In your sputum?

PATIENT: Uh, it's felt a little itchy I guess but no pain with swallowing.
DOCTOR: And do you have any chest pain or chest pressure?
PATIENT: Yeah, when I like, uh, take a deep breath or after after I cough I've been having some chest pain.
DOCTOR: To give it a number from one to ten, what would you say in terms of how severe it is with ten being the worst pain ever.
PATIENT: I would say, maybe six. It feels pretty sharp when it happens and it goes away after a few minutes.
DOCTOR: OK, and where exactly is it, is the pain?
PATIENT: Uh yeah, I kind of feel it, Yeah, just over on the right side of the sternum.
DOCTOR: OK. Alright, and does it radiate anywhere? Does it go anywhere other than that one location?
PATIENT: No, I feel it just in the one spot.
DOCTOR: OK, uhm, and has that pain gotten worse overtime?
PATIENT: No, that pain started, I guess like two days ago. More recent than the cough or shortness of breath.
DOCTOR: I see, I see, OK. And so you said that coughing makes it worse and sometimes breathing in. So is it just normal breathing or when you're doing like, deep breathing?
PATIENT: Deep breathing.
DOCTOR: Deep breathing hurts? OK. Alright, and you've never experienced this before, right?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had a pain like this before.
DOCTOR: OK, when you sort of touch that area over your chest, does touching it make it worse?
