DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Hi doc, how you doing?
DOCTOR: Actually [REDACTED] right?
PATIENT: Well I think it's a little more than that doc.  I guess you’ll figure all that out.
DOCTOR: Isn't that why you called?
PATIENT: Yeah the ankle and from here to the ankle.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take off the shoes and look at both of them.  Tell me what happened.
PATIENT: I don't know.  Uh you know I’ve been getting swelling in these ankles and in the ankle for a while but I'll ice it and it'll go down.  I injured it in the military and it never really healed.  When I was in the Army I had a cast on it.
DOCTOR: You said this has been going on ten years or something?
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: So what's the deal here?
PATIENT: You know it was off and on.  If I twisted it or something usually but since the last couple of months.
DOCTOR: Alright so the last couple of months.
PATIENT: It’s been swelling more and not going down.
DOCTOR: Last couple months having more swelling.  And pain or just swelling?
PATIENT: Well it was just swelling there, for the past three weeks.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED], last three weeks.
PATIENT: And a coloration change.
DOCTOR: In the last three weeks with a color change and some pain.
PATIENT: No, not some pain, it's a sharp like pin sticking pain.
DOCTOR: Oh oh.  You got diabetes?
PATIENT: Yeah diabetes.
DOCTOR: Like needles?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Worse at night?
It's also worse throughout the day and I'm having numbness too in the area.
DOCTOR: Since I'm not your doctor so I don't know your background but it could be that your diabetes is getting worse.
PATIENT: Yeah much worse.
DOCTOR: And you're having so alright. How do I explain this?  So you got some nerves right.  This is your leg right.  You have arteries and you have nerves right.  These are the nerves.  What do you think the nerves do right?
PATIENT: Probably sensation yeah.
DOCTOR: Sensation that's one.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: One is moving them right.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And some of the nerves go up to the arteries all right.  So there's nerves going everywhere right.  So with the diabetes your circulation isn't great.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Alright.  The less controlled you are the blood it's not circulating very well.  That's why they want you to check your blood pressure.  That's why they want that.  You don't have that, you're gonna have disease.  What's gonna happen, you're gonna have venous stasis, this chronic lower extremity edema and that's in relation like if somebody's not controlling themselves they're going to have ugly looking legs.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: You know when it gets all red and scaly.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: And then there's more that do control themselves, they don't get that so.  Every time that kind of shows this [REDACTED] control that kind of thing.  The nerves they need to nutrition.  It's just like how your muscles need nutrition to move so if your nerves have poor circulation to them they start getting damage and that's where the pins and needles and numbness, so they're getting damaged.  Why because the circulation is bad.  Why is the circulation bad, because of the diabetes [REDACTED].  Some of that is irreversible.  Once we get to that point there is no more going back, so you just damaged it you know.  So the only hope is try to prevent it from getting worse and try to control your sugars.  So let me see how your sugars have been.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Like I say I'm not your doctor so I have no idea of your history so on June 8th you were 8% which is not good.  Do you know what your A1c is?
PATIENT: I had another one at Advocate health fair and it was 7.4.
DOCTOR: And that was when?
PATIENT: That was one month ago, July they had that.
DOCTOR: They did a spot check?
PATIENT: No they took blood.  They took blood, sent it to a lab and sent me the results back within about two weeks.
DOCTOR: So 7.5.  So you've been averaging about 169 fasting glucose for the last three months.
PATIENT: Usually they're 166.
DOCTOR: So then with an 8 on June 15th you were averaging like 180 fasting.  So it's not very well controlled.
PATIENT: But I haven't been able to exercise cause [REDACTED].  I used to just ride a bike [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Have you been taking your insulin?
PATIENT: I been taking insulin.
DOCTOR: And have you been watching what you eat?
PATIENT: Now I can't say I've been watching greatly but I have been yes watching it.
DOCTOR: What have your uh, what has your fasting glucose been like in the morning.  Like this morning what was it?  Do you check it every morning?
PATIENT: Oh yeah. This morning I was rushing and didn’t check it, I usually try to check it every morning but I'm usually in the 120s and many times lower in the morning.
DOCTOR: What was it yesterday?
PATIENT: Uh yesterday it was 119 yesterday.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have, like I say, I'll get up into the high 120s sometimes.  It's just the way.
DOCTOR: What's the highest it's ever been?
PATIENT: In the mornings 137 I believe it was.  Over this last couple of months.
DOCTOR: Yeah that A1c that you got from [REDACTED] was like 130s, 120s you know.
PATIENT: It's during the day I think that it spikes on me pretty bad.  Uh I've had lows in the middle of the night uh when they first gave me that Aspart, then I'd have to get up and I'd have to drink something, some sugary drink or get some hard candy and I noticed that affects me when I take my morning sugar.  Uh but and I'm not eating much in the morning.  Yeah but when I eat.
DOCTOR: It doesn't help yeah.  For diabetics, like for other people it doesn't matter but for diabetics, it's more important that you eat every day at the same time.
PATIENT: Yes but what I do at my job.  But I eat; I may have dinner at 10-10:30 a night.  I think that affects me because of the way I work.
DOCTOR: What do you do?
PATIENT: Uh I do network stuff and I work odd hours, depends on when I'm called and what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: But think about it if you eat late and then you go to bed late.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know.
PATIENT: I think that's one of the main problems right there.  I've got this, I'm trying to change jobs right and I change what I do to get expanded out but I find myself eating [REDACTED] constant now and I told my other doctor the same thing.  I mean I got to work and that sort of work is not really four or five almost is,[REDACTED] there but never that late and I know that's the problem.
DOCTOR: You didn't hurt your leg, like you didn't have trauma.
PATIENT: Oh no, no, no.  [REDACTED].  No it just started hurting [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Let me go over your meds real quick.  You on fish oil?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Do you still use the artificial tears?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Uh hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril combination?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: And you have insulin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: How much do you take?
PATIENT: Uh 55 at night, 50 in the morning.
DOCTOR: Of Glargine right?
PATIENT: Of Glargine.
DOCTOR: And what do you do for the premeals?
PATIENT: The Aspart?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It depends on what I eat, I have to adjust it.
DOCTOR: Adjust it.
PATIENT: And the most I take is 20 units.
DOCTOR: And then you take pravastatin.
PATIENT: Pravastatin.
DOCTOR: At night and the metformin three times?
PATIENT: Metformin at night.  Its three pills at night.
DOCTOR: Three pills at night.  Now it says here take three tablets by mouth at bedtime, oh never mind.  [REDACTED].  Yeah three at night right, okay.  And you are taking the metformin?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Have you ever been started on gabapentin?
PATIENT: What is it, I had the gabapentin, I think it caused me some problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's the only thing that'll relieve some of the numbness and burning.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: That's for a diabetic otherwise there's nothing else then.
PATIENT: Yeah well I might have to start taking it again then.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But I'm trying to remember what the gabapentin did, I don't remember.
DOCTOR: Sleepy?
PATIENT: I don't remember, it's been a while.
DOCTOR: Well we could a half a pill; it doesn't mean you have to go high.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's the thing maybe somebody tried to go up too high on you.  Alright, so why don't you lay back and I'll raise this thing up.  Alright, relax and close your eyes.  Which toe am I poking at?
PATIENT: The little toe.
DOCTOR: The little one right?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And we'll call the big toe one and then you know one, two, three, four, five.
PATIENT: And I just call the little one a five.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: One, that might be one, that felt like two.
DOCTOR: And where am I pressing now?
PATIENT: Oh you're over now on my left foot now.
DOCTOR: Yeah where?
PATIENT: In the middle.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That would be number five on the left.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

DOCTOR: You have good sensations.
PATIENT: I have no problem in my toes [REDACTED].  But it gets right there.

PATIENT: Hmm.  That's what I call [REDACTED].

DOCTOR: You have fungus.  That's probably the cause of it.
PATIENT: Cause of what?

So I know you take a bath every day but I'm gonna try to mark it and see if you can try to avoid cleaning the markers off so when the nurse sees you in a week she can see if that redness has gone down, right in here.
PATIENT: Yeah.  All I take is a shower uh.
DOCTOR: Just kind of dab around it and try to avoid [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Getting the water on it.
DOCTOR: Yeah or at least washing the marker so we can see if um.

PATIENT: Okay, yeah.  Could I have been bitten by something also?
DOCTOR: Well this is another thing sometimes yes it could be spider bites.
PATIENT: Yeah because I had rats and I had to have the house fumigated.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: White spiders.
DOCTOR: But the most common reason might be because of that fungus.

PATIENT: Okay.  [REDACTED] anything you know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh of cellulitis?
