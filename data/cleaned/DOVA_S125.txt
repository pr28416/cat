DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yes ma'am.
DOCTOR: Hi.  How you doing?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Good to see you.
PATIENT: It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: I know, is that a good thing?  Have you been healthy?
PATIENT: Oh yes and no.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Odds and ends.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Come on in.  Have a seat.  So tell me how you've been.
PATIENT: Well so far, so good. I uh.
DOCTOR: Any issues today?
PATIENT: No, not really.  I uh just got back from Arizona.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I spent eight months over there.  Uh they got me here with some medication that I couldn't get here but I got it over there, why I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Are you still working out?
PATIENT: I try, yes ma'am.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How many times a week?
PATIENT: Well right now I'm trying to go twice a week.  I used to go three times but uh the last 2 1/2 years, I don't know if you remember but my wife had those strokes and she had another one in 09.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's why we went to Arizona for the winter last year.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And uh we had to come back here because uh Medicare.  We had to be here in Illinois.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: We just got back here in December.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Which I hated it, to come back.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Well letâ€™s see here, so you're still getting your alprazolam here.
PATIENT: There's one medication I came here a couple of weeks back that one of the doctors wanted canceled.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh, well I don't pronounce those words.
DOCTOR: Doxycycline?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Now why are you taking that?
PATIENT: Because of my nose, it breaks out.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: I get uh blisters.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh this was recommended by Dermatology.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Now when I, this doctor said it's no good, it could cause problems later on.
DOCTOR: Well it can.  How often do you use it?
PATIENT: Well as long as nothing pops up on my nose I don't take it.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Sometimes I take three times a week, sometimes twice, all depends.  When I see my nose breaking out that's when I take the medication.
DOCTOR: So are you taking 100 mg of metoprolol now?  Cause we have you on 200 here.
PATIENT: Uh, what does that say 200?
DOCTOR: It says 100.
PATIENT: 100 yeah.
DOCTOR: And we have 200.
PATIENT: Yeah but I've been taking half of it.
DOCTOR: You take half a pill?
PATIENT: I've been taking half of it right.
DOCTOR: Alright let me just change that cause.
PATIENT: I should have brought the bottle.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Now this here, this one here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Medication.
DOCTOR: The oxybutynin?
PATIENT: Yeah uh was given to me because a couple of times I find myself uh wet at night.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The pajamas or I couldn't hold it so I stopped at the VA over there in Arizona and they says no you don't have an infection it just could be your bladder and I've been taking that too as I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Now one thing I don't understand.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh the VA Hospital, as far as I understand, regardless of where they are, you should honor the other place, their instructions or whatever.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I was there and I didn't have no problem.  They registered me right away.  Uh I went to the hospital; they assigned me to a doctor.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I came here and I ran a couple medications and they wouldn't give them to me, they said no, no you have to see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Well you know I have to actually renew the medicines.  I have to put in the order otherwise the Pharmacy can't fill it.  So that might have been what happened.
PATIENT: Yeah but if I, I can see if I'm out completely that I have to renew it but if it's still good, the bottle says renew a couple of more times or whatever.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Why when I.
DOCTOR: I don't know the answer to that.  That's weird cause.  I don't really know.
PATIENT: Why isn't that particular medication that I'm telling you about my nose?
DOCTOR: Yeah that one had expired in our system.  That's why you couldn't get it.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: So it needed to be reordered by a doctor and I've done that.
PATIENT: And then he only gave me enough, he gave me nine pills only.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Like I say I take that when my nose breaks out.
DOCTOR: Right.  Alright and then are you doing the aspirin through the VA?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: You're just buying that over-the-counter?
PATIENT: You cut me off.
DOCTOR: Well you can get it here.  It's probably cheaper to just buy it over-the-counter.
PATIENT: Its cheaper buying over-the-counter yes, that's alright.  I can handle that one.
DOCTOR: I mean I can order it for you through here.
PATIENT: No I'll get it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh the uh, the softener.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  I reordered that.
PATIENT: You did, good.  Cause they canceled me here one time and then I just noticed I still got it here.  Now the other medication that I'm taking is um like complex vitamin B.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Those were recommended by the cardiologist.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And I'm still taking that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah the one medication that is.
DOCTOR: The saw palmetto that's an over-the-counter thing.
PATIENT: Uh the one medication that I don't have here.
DOCTOR: Lovaza?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah we don't have that here.  That's not in our pharmacy.
PATIENT: And that baby's expensive.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  That's why we don't have it in our pharmacy.
PATIENT: And I been taking that since I had my bypass.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  I can see if I can get it.
PATIENT: I had a uh blood work over there and I'm always concerned about my prostate and according to them it was real good, it was 1 point something.
DOCTOR: Okay.  How much of the Lovaza are you on?  Do you remember?
PATIENT: No it's not, I don't have it here.  I'm surprised, yeah wait a minute, wait a minute.  That's my wife's list.  I thought I had everything in order, 1 mg.
DOCTOR: Is that daily?  Once a day?
PATIENT: This?  Again I take it three times a week, four times a week because it's expensive.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: See the metoprolol, I got it here as a half.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright, have you eaten today?
PATIENT: Uh I had coffee and a roll.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Do you still see DOCTOR?
PATIENT: Yeah my cardiologist.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.  In fact I should have had a stress test, a stress test.  I haven't seen him since two years ago or three years ago and I call him up, he says yeah come in and we'll give a test.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I took a stress test and all that.
DOCTOR: And it was okay?
PATIENT: Yeah he did blood work on that too, yes.  He showed me the x-ray before and after and.
DOCTOR: You mean the stress test?
PATIENT: Yeah and they show pretty good.
DOCTOR: Good.  Okay.
PATIENT: I'm taking um that uh sleeping pill.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Uh because I guess, us, they call it stress with my wife and had to put her in a home, after 2 1/2 years taking care of her.  It was getting to me.  I wasn't getting no sleep, at all, maybe two hours, three hours at night.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I'm still taking that and that sort of helps me relax at night.  Well it helps me fall asleep.
DOCTOR: Alright and then you had your colonoscopy in 2002 right?
PATIENT: The what?
DOCTOR: You had your colonoscopy in 2002 at Gotleib?
PATIENT: Yeah.

PATIENT: I don't know, you want to do it?
DOCTOR: Well I'd like to do your fasting labs but you haven't been fasting.
PATIENT: No well they didn't tell me.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So what do you want me to do?  Do you want me to order them and you can come back at your convenience and get them done?
PATIENT: Yeah why don't we do that.  Like I said in Arizona they did a blood work.
DOCTOR: When was the most recent blood work?  That was at the VA right?
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Let me take a look at it.
PATIENT: It should be there.
DOCTOR: Sometimes it's hard to pull it up.
PATIENT: Since I had my angioplasty done, back in '93, this same doctor, DOCTOR, suggested I should have a little wine at night.
DOCTOR: Yeah you could.
PATIENT: So I been doing that.  In fact, they did the stress test and I said shall I stay on the wine, yes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But no more than two glasses though.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Oh your cholesterol is okay on that labs.

DOCTOR: Your total cholesterol is 152; we like to see less than 100 or less than 200.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: And your bad cholesterol, your LDL we like to be less than 100 and yours was 86 so that's good.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I was going at the Y over there.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

I was trying to prove that it happened just before the Korean and I can't find the records.  I know there's records here, they took care of it but they x-rayed it.
DOCTOR: Okay give me just a couple of minutes okay.
