DOCTOR: OK. And any issues with moving your hip or your ankle?
PATIENT: Uh no.
DOCTOR: OK, um so I think that was everything I wanted to ask and check today. Did did you have any questions?
PATIENT: Um yeah, so um how do you, how can I treat my knee?
DOCTOR: Yeah, certainly, so it it sounds like um this could be most likely osteoarthritis um of the left knee, which uh is something that would be best treated with uh trying to stay as active as you can, but but also pacing your activities as well, so that you're not um doing so much that the next day you're in significant amount of pain, but it's important to remember that um activity will help um with keeping your knee mobile, but also um actually help with reducing pain as well, and then also uh you could use Tylenol um as a medication for it. I wouldn't recommend ibuprofen or NSAIDs on a long term basis, although you could take those if you're having like an acute flare up of your pain. Um and then also like topical agents such as um like Voltaren or something like that you could put on your knee and um if it's really bad and it keeps um continuing on, we can consider something like a steroid injection as well.
PATIENT: OK, yeah, that sounds good. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you.
