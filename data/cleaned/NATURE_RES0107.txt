DOCTOR: No? Even for his eczema?
PATIENT: It's pretty mild.
DOCTOR: OK. Um has, have you ever like given him um Reactine or like any of the, those anti allergy medications in the past?
PATIENT: I've tried the, uh, yeah, the ones over the counter, um, they do help. Um, I tried it this time, but uh it didn't do much.
DOCTOR: OK. OK. And, I was gonna ask you something else. Um, his symptoms, like the sneezing and the, and the runny nose, like has he experienced this before?
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: OK.
PATIENT: It usually gets worse um uh I guess like around this time, uh I can tell when spring is coming up. Um, it gets pretty bad, but he always has a runny nose um and he sneezes sometimes here and there.
DOCTOR: OK, and you mentioned this has been going on for more than four days this time around?
PATIENT: It's been, it's been going on for the past uh two weeks.
DOCTOR: OK. OK, and is it like um impairing his like daily activities or like his ability to um like, sleep?
PATIENT: Uh it does affect his sleep sometimes he doesn't like um, just the itching really bothers him.
DOCTOR: Mhmm.
PATIENT: So he can't uh, he finds it hard to fall asleep. That's like, I usually, that's when I give him the the medications. To help him fall asleep.
DOCTOR: OK. OK. And uh is he up to date with all his immunizations?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: OK. Any family history of asthma, eczema, or something called allergic rhinitis?
PATIENT: Uh I have asthma.
DOCTOR: OK. And is your asthma severe?
PATIENT: Uh no, it's it's pretty well controlled. I used to, actually, I used to have asthma as a child.
DOCTOR: OK, I see.
PATIENT: It's pretty well controlled right now. I don't even need medications.
DOCTOR: OK, OK.
PATIENT: I remember I used to, I used to get allergies as well as a child.
DOCTOR: Oh I see.
PATIENT: But very similar, lots of sneezing and yeah.
DOCTOR: Mhmm, alright. Were you ever, did you ever take like an allergy test?
PATIENT: No. I didn't think about it, I just never, like my my my parents didn't take me to get that testing done.
DOCTOR: OK, how about your son? Has he been allergy tested?
PATIENT: No, but I feel like he probably should.
DOCTOR: Yeah, OK. And then, does anyone at home smoke?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No, OK. Um do you have any, like old carpets, dust, mold, or asbestos at your place?
PATIENT: Uh we've got all of, we got our carpets uh removed uh two years ago. That's actually helped uh with his symptoms. Uh and I know, we tried it, we removed the curtains as well and we've used blinds. So yeah.
DOCTOR: OK.
PATIENT: And I don't think so, I don't think there's any spores or things like that.
DOCTOR: OK, good. Um, is he an otherwise healthy child like developmental wise, like he's growing, gaining weight OK, like he's, his motor skills and like social behaviours are all up to par with his peers?
PATIENT: Oh yeah he's doing great.
DOCTOR: OK OK good um those are all the questions I had for you today. Did you have any questions of your own?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No, OK. So for him um it sounds more in keeping with something called allergic rhinitis than an infection, but because his symptoms do overlap with that of Covid,  we'll probably get him a swab anyways, and those results should come back in 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, rhinitis is, allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to certain things, so we can get him allergy tested um and that will give us a better understanding of like what his triggers are and the way to treat that is to avoid those triggers, those allergens. And if his symptoms are persistent, um we will prescribe him also like an intranasal corticosteroid. Um and there are like, there are like second line treatments as well, like antihistamines and leukotriene, like leukotriene receptor antagonists, but those are like second line. We'll we'll see how he does with the inhaled corticosteroids at first. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds great.
DOCTOR: OK, great.
PATIENT: Thank you.
DOCTOR: No problem.
