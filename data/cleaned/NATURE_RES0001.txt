PATIENT: OK.
DOCTOR: Yeah, anything like that that you know of?

cut it down, but still something that I'm working on.
DOCTOR: OK good, I'm glad you're trying to cut down. Um, we have resources available if you're interested
in some more help. And you smoke um marijuana?

DOCTOR: OK, alright, and so those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have anything that you wanted to add? Anything that I hadn't touched on?
PATIENT: Um No, I think you covered everything. Thank you.
DOCTOR: OK yeah, no worries. So I guess at this point we would do a physical exam. Just take a listen to your lungs and your chest. After that, so right now it sounds like it could be something vascular you know, like a pulmonary embolism like we talked about. That's kind of high on my list of things to
work up for. But also, we don't want to miss other things you know, like
cancer, infection, autoimmune things that could affect your lungs, so we'll just do a
work up for all of that. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, whatever, whatever you think we need to do.
DOCTOR: OK sounds good. Thank you for your time.
PATIENT: Yeah, thanks.
