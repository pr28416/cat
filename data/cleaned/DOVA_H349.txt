DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But uh yeah I don't know.  I suppose I could go to one of those.
DOCTOR: Well it's just up to you yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's a pretty far drive um and some of the other clinics you know are coordinated with other hospitals.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Like if like if you've gone somewhere in Indiana.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I know like Hines would be like further south would be like Oak Lawn I think.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: And so you know some those just kind of divide it up.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know and I Chicago Heights is maybe with Jesse Brown but I know Oak Lawn for sure is like with Hines.
PATIENT: Hmm.  Chicago Heights is the St. Janeâ€™s Hospital.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And South Suburban is nearby and Olympia Fields.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  Well maybe like if it's easier for you.  You know you could always transfer to one of the outlying clinics you know.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um yeah.  But the only thing I want to do today is I'll put in a renewal for your medications I just need to check some of these labs [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I'll either mail that or fax it to you as soon as I can get that.
DOCTOR: Um probably we can check on, the only thing I can't check today is the cholesterol.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: For the cholesterol you have to fast.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I just need to check basic, basic labs.
PATIENT: I see, yeah.
DOCTOR: So you can see, I'm going to do that up here and we'll see if [REDACTED].  Um, cause I think the last labs we have here in our system is 2008.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: A couple of years ago, so we should get some, you know.  Lipitor 80 mg.  No problems with the medications at all that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have they changed your doses recently?
PATIENT: No they've been the same.  I asked about that and he said well we'll just stick with them for now.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay let me talk to my attending I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  64:44  DOCTOR IN:  71:10)
DOCTOR: Okay, so these okay let me see.  Have been on the Lipitor for a while, have they changed the dose, do you know?
PATIENT: Uh I am due for renewal of the prescriptions at some point.
DOCTOR: Okay, but I mean have you changed the dose recently?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So I have a couple of questions.  We need to check lab work before I can refill your medicines.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You know, what I can do, there's a couple of options.  So one thing is we can check most of the labs today um.
PATIENT: How much what?
DOCTOR: We could check most of the lab work today.
PATIENT: Oh okay yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: So that would make all the meds okay except for the Lipitor.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: You know, so we have a couple of options.  I could either check all the labs today and redo all of your medications through here except for the Lipitor.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then I'd either need the records of fasting lipids you know the cholesterol.
PATIENT: Oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Or have you come back and do the fasting lab before I give you the Lipitor.
PATIENT: Oh I see yeah.
DOCTOR: Or we could just hold off and have you come back in a week or so and get all the lab work done and then I could renew all the medicines.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Which one works better for you?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] test done, you the result.
DOCTOR: Well what we could do is we could check all the lab work today.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Then I could refill all the meds except for the Lipitor.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Then I could just give you the fax number and you could fax over the.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Your cholesterol and then we could give you the Lipitor.
PATIENT: Okay that'll work fine.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um, let's see here.  I'll have them do the labs [REDACTED].  Um so one thing is, we don't have that exact one but have an equivalent.
PATIENT: Is that lisinopril?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril.
PATIENT: Yeah that's what I've been getting.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Cause that [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: I'm pretty sure.
PATIENT: I know all of them have two or three or four names.
DOCTOR: Right.  Um, [REDACTED] is like, I mean it's in the same class.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I added the lisinopril 2.5.
PATIENT: Okay it's up to you whatever.
DOCTOR: It's equivalent.
PATIENT: Yeah whatever gets the job done.
DOCTOR: Let me see, lisinopril.  (Doctor working on computer)  Okay lisinopril, the Plavix, the aspirin, Fosamax, Synthroid, the lisinopril and metoprolol [REDACTED].  So today we'll do the lab work they'll do electrolytes, your lipids and thyroid.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay so we'll get the lab work today up here.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then um, I'll have to give you the fax number out front um that way, we need to look at the cholesterol if you'll just fax it.  I'll have you fax it over here.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Um, otherwise you know, just have you come back next year.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay but if some of the other clinics are closer to you, if you'd like transfer over there.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: No problem and then um you know once I get the [REDACTED] of the cholesterol I'll renew the Lipitor.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and oh yeah so when you come back, if do a lot of lab work from outside doctors.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And you don't want to repeat it, just the next time you get the lab work always get a paper copy for yourself.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And when you bring it in.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: As long as you have records of some lab work.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Then we won't have to repeat it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Very good.
DOCTOR: Alright, so just check the lab work and then you can send me the fax alright?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So uh.  Why don't you have a seat here.
