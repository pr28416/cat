DOCTOR: Well no people can take two, three, four.
PATIENT: They told me no I shouldn't be taking them so they took them off.  I don't know if it was lisinopril or listopril or something like that.
DOCTOR: Let's see.  Pressure is not well controlled, so blood pressure was high.  Had to stop hydrochlorothiazide due to elevated creatinine.  So we stopped your hydrochlorothiazide.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we didn't stop the lisinopril but we stopped the hydrochlorothiazide.  Let me see if anybody else stopped it.  The Dietary didn't do anything.

PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: Hydrochlorothiazide.  It's not on there cause I took it off.
PATIENT: But it's on here, oh no it's not.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And then that's the one I don't take.  I know you guys took one off for me and I say okay.
DOCTOR: It wasn't the lisinopril then.
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Uh maybe they call it listopril?
DOCTOR: No, no, no, lisinopril.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I knew no one else would have told you that.
PATIENT: Yeah I got the lid scrub.  One check, no more refills.
DOCTOR: Are you drinking water?
PATIENT: A lot of water.  Peeing every five minutes man.  Why is my water down?
DOCTOR: No your creatinine is still high.
PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: That's for your kidneys.  And we already took and you weren't taking the hydrochlorothiazide anymore?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Cause you don't have any [REDACTED] huh?

PATIENT: Not really.  I just take them cause there's a ton in the morning and a ton in the evening.
DOCTOR: Well your sugar is getting better.
PATIENT: Yeah just that when it drops, my reaction is eat a candy or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Instead of, but then when I overeat it goes up, if it's regular food it doesn't matter.  The sugar's gonna go up.
DOCTOR: Pull up [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well what do I do then?
DOCTOR: Endocrine.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] the diabetes doctor but they give me a pharmacist though.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.  Let's see, did you do the Hemoccult, the poop?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I did two of them.
DOCTOR: Okay let's see.  Okay it was, they said they couldn't do it.  This was in December.  They said it wasn't a good sample.
PATIENT: Right so they told me to send another one.
DOCTOR: Did you send another one?
PATIENT: Yeah cause they gave me a paper to come out here and get it.  Somebody gave me the card with that.  He said it wouldn't work so I had to do it again.
DOCTOR: There's all these labs I wanted you to get and you didn't get them.
PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: Back in May. Why didn’t they draw any of these today? Anyway let's see, creatinine, phosphorus, there's no stool order.  Alright I'll have to do another one.  Since you don't want to get the colonoscopy right?

DOCTOR: But this was the second time they took it, it was 117?
PATIENT: The first time was 147.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: They said the second one was real good, whatever.
DOCTOR: Now I'll order the, the eye drops are already ordered so it's not like I could do anything.  I would call the Pharmacy and make sure they give you another one.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And just let them know that you never got the one before that.
PATIENT: Yeah, it's weird that I didn't.  I got the, like I said I got the eye scrub but never got the drops cause they were supposed to come at the same time.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Call them you can renew it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It's there.  All you have to do is just call and have them send it to you okay.
PATIENT: Sounds like a plan.
DOCTOR: Alright so what are you gonna do?  You're gonna see the eye doctor right?
PATIENT: Yeah I guess I'll go down there and make an appointment.
DOCTOR: Go and make an appointment, call to get your eye drops cause it’s in there.  All you have to do is just call it.  So eye doctor, eye drops, do the stool cards and whenever you're able to come back you can just turn it in cause the lab is in there and what else? Anything else going on?
PATIENT: Yeah how come I get headaches now?  My arm hurts and my neck hurts.  Just right here.

PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: It hurts?
PATIENT: But I could still do it, yes that hurt.  But they sent me to therapy for this but it still.  It was okay and now it's starting to hurt again.
DOCTOR: Is it the same pain?
PATIENT: Yeah back here and over here.
DOCTOR: It was the same pain before?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It was the same pain.
PATIENT: And then my leg hurt down here.
DOCTOR: Let's see, Occupational Therapy.
PATIENT: And it worked, she did it once and I don't know what was wrong but she got it straightened out quick.  I think her name was NAME the therapist.
DOCTOR: Yeah NAME.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Have you continued doing the therapy at home?
PATIENT: Yeah.  Well I do until it starts hurting then I stop.
DOCTOR: I think you need to start.
PATIENT: Same thing with walking.  I try to walk.
DOCTOR: This was just in June.
PATIENT: Right I try to walk and everything starts hurting again.  I'm hoping my legs.
DOCTOR: Are you doing, did you do the stretching today?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Did you do it in the last week?
PATIENT: Yeah.  I went, well I was gonna go Sunday but I couldn't because our basement was flooded in my house.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Where I live so I had to go upstairs and we had a plumber.
DOCTOR: Were you doing stuff, moving around?
PATIENT: No.  They don't let me do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Cause they got a treadmill so I get on that treadmill and I walk on the treadmill.
DOCTOR: And you started getting pain in your arm?
PATIENT: Mostly my legs.  My neck I don't know why it just started out of the blue it started hurting.  It's been like that for a couple weeks now.
DOCTOR: Have you taken a Tylenol or anything?
PATIENT: No cause I take the aspirin in the morning with my pills.
DOCTOR: Yeah but the aspirin is more for your diabetes.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And then you should take a Tylenol.
PATIENT: Take a regular Tylenol?
DOCTOR: Yeah like 600 or 650, whatever the dose is.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: I think they sell them 325, just take two of those.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then see how you do when you're walking but I think you need to start stretching every day just like the physical therapist and if it doesn't help then you can call and let the nurse know that you want therapy or call the therapist.  Can you set up an appointment with the therapist?
PATIENT: I guess I could yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I got her thing at home.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You could call her and ask her if she says that I have to order it again then call the nurse and let them know.
PATIENT: Well actually you didn't order it, it was the doctor DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Oh the endocrinologist.
PATIENT: Right she's the one that ordered it.
DOCTOR: And then you felt better?
PATIENT: Yeah right away.  She was massaging and doing all kinds of crazy stuff and then right away it started working.
DOCTOR: But you've got to stretch every day then.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  I think you've got to do everything they told you to do in therapy every day though.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay and if it doesn't work then we might have to enroll you again for physical therapy. Alright so you're gonna stretch right?
PATIENT: Well yeah.
DOCTOR: And then try to take some Tylenol.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: And then if it doesn't work then you have to see therapy again.
PATIENT: Because I mean I'm walking even though it's killing me.  Like in my arm and my legs too, this leg.  And I walk cause they said you have to walk.  I says okay but shit I go a little bit then everything starts hurting.  And it's all on this side all the time the right side.
DOCTOR: Oh because you have peripheral vascular disease too.
PATIENT: Right.  What is that?  I got all kinds of good stuff.
DOCTOR: Did you get the CT run-off at all or no?
PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: Because it looks like DOCTOR wanted you to have a run-off.
PATIENT: A run-off?
DOCTOR: Yeah basically a CT scan to look at your arteries.  They didn't do it right?

DOCTOR: Okay and they'll take care of the rest?
PATIENT: Yeah, Medicaid or whatever.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: I could go to either one.  I can go here but they didn't want to do it last time so when I went to Rush and I told them that it was bothering me they just did it on this side first time and then when they put the stents they did it in my leg.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: On this side.
