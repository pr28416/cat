DOCTOR: [REDACTED] you follow up in two months and that was in September but of course that.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Everything happened with the uh shooting and what not.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um, other than that, anything else we need to address today?
PATIENT: No, like I say it would be great if you could sign me up with someone to talk with a psychiatrist or whatever.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And also I'm thinking maybe some stuff to stop smoking.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: I want to stop smoking so.
DOCTOR: How much are you smoking right now?
PATIENT: Right now about five or six cigarettes a day you know.  Never got through a pack yet, but I five or six is enough.
DOCTOR: Um you want to be put in the Smoking Cessation Clinic?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Because they actually have a special clinic and work with you a few times and help you to get your stuff together, to help you stop smoking.
PATIENT: When is it and where is it, because transportation wise…
DOCTOR: So it meets at different times, I don’t know exactly, it's headed up by the Social Work Department and [REDACTED] some of it is actually you know over the phone, it's not like AA where you come in you know for meetings.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um then they can set you up with an initial appointment and then they can give you the medication.  There are nicotine patches and bupropion which is another medicine which ironically can help you with depression and help you increase your energy levels um to do a little bit better but um and that's gonna help stop smoking as well with the smoking cessation so.  Um I mean I can refer you to the Smoking Cessation Clinic and if it doesn't work for you logistically you don't have to come.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: That's totally fine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's just what I would recommend since we have it that opportunity here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think it’s worth it to you to explore if it’s all right with you.
PATIENT: Yes, uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Do it yes, cool.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um and uh any heavy alcohol use, drinking at home?
PATIENT: Not heavy.  I do drink about a six-pack and a half a week.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And it has not increased.  Actually it decreased a lot.  I haven't been drunk.  Just some beers yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's all, no heavy drinking.
DOCTOR: And you're smoking how many cigarettes?
PATIENT: About six a day.  Six or seven a day.
DOCTOR: Now the only thing to be cautioned of is with the Norco or the pain medication that you're on, is one of the components is Tylenol and it clears through the liver.  Alcohol also gets cleared from the liver.  You shouldn't take them both together.
PATIENT: No I don't, yes I know.
DOCTOR: And because these can actually cause some liver damage and inflammation of the liver I don't want that to happen.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah.
DOCTOR: So I'd say if anything you know, until you start backing off the Vicodin or the Norco pain medication, I wouldn't drink.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um actually not to the critical level right now you know where you have to worry about extreme liver toxicity but nevertheless it could you cause some damage to your liver or some inflammation and I don’t think it’s worth it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But I mean I don’t mind your drinking, it’s safe if you weren't taking the pain medication.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Cut ack if you can.
PATIENT: That's cool, no problem.
DOCTOR: Okay let me take a look at your lungs, just have a seat if you want to sit up here.  I'm gonna check your blood pressure.  A lots happened since the last time.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Holy cow.  Deep breath.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Remind me, what did you do in the service?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  On my right.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'm like excused absences of course [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: A little bit on the high side [REDACTED] over 82.  And do you know if they gave you a tetanus shot?
PATIENT: When it happened yes.
DOCTOR: They did.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, what was the date of that?
PATIENT: November 21st.  November 21st, that's when all that took place, I got a tetanus shot in the arm yeah.
DOCTOR: Give me a couple of minutes; I'll be right back alright.
PATIENT: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  50:47  DOCTOR IN:  58:04)
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Well I'll tell you what, couple things.  It seems like you get all of  your pain medications from your outside doctors correct.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll let them follow up with that.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Um but I did want you to get repeat labs today through us.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And I want to check your liver function as well.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay since you're on all that pain medication and [REDACTED] the liver.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And if you know, I just want to reiterated and like I said before with the alcohol and the pain medications both are cleared through the liver [REDACTED] inflammation.  So that the [REDACTED] liver function.  And next is the blood pressure, I think the reason [REDACTED] pretty high is that because you have pain.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um and on top of that all the stress regarding anything that's going on with your leg and you had some hypertension or high blood pressure from before.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So I'd like to increase the dose of your high blood pressure medicine and I want you to start taking those [REDACTED].  And in that regard we'll check the kidney function today and all your electrolytes cause this can kind of mess up your electrolytes um and then in about 2-4 weeks, at your convenience come back for a repeat blood pressure check with the nurse and repeat the lab making sure that everything is okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: And then I'd like to see you in 2-3 months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Is that cool to you?
PATIENT: Uh-huh, yeah.
DOCTOR: And I'll set you up with all those people.
PATIENT: Cool, cool.
DOCTOR: Just give me a second I'll order all these labs and what not.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Do you want the blood pressure medicine sent through the mail?
PATIENT: Yes do that.
DOCTOR: Okay, then you don’t have to wait. And them you come back in about 2-4 weeks for a repeat of your labs.  Now I don't know when you can get in to see the psychiatrist or the psychologist uh it might be two, three, four weeks.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I put in for them to see you a little bit sooner than more than two weeks.  I don't know if that works in their schedule.  If you have any problems or you can't get in for a long time, what I'd recommend you do is just go to the Mental Health Intake Center but I'm gonna write down the number for you okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And this is for the lab?
DOCTOR: Yeah all the labs are in.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You need some labs around the corner.
PATIENT: Oh okay just around the corner here?
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: Okay cool.
DOCTOR: And then come back in 2-3 months to see me and then 2-4 weeks to see the nurse for a repeat blood pressure check and you can stop up here in the clinic and also repeat for the labs to make sure your kidney functions [REDACTED] bump of the dose of that blood pressure medicine.
PATIENT: Okay will I just come or will it come in the mail?
DOCTOR: Just come.
PATIENT: Just come.
DOCTOR: You just come anytime.  Like if you have an appointment with the Mental Health people.
PATIENT: Yeah, right.
DOCTOR: Come up just right afterward or right before.
PATIENT: Okay.  No, for you, though.
DOCTOR: Oh they'll give you an appointment.
PATIENT: Okay at Mental Health yeah.
DOCTOR: No they'll send you something.
PATIENT: Right okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Um I think that's [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: If there's any problems in the meantime please just give me a call, like you did before.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And I'll get a hold of you.
PATIENT: Okay [REDACTED].
