DOCTOR: PATIENT?  Okay.  How are you today?
PATIENT: Right here.  Well how are you?
DOCTOR: Alright.  How are you?
PATIENT: I don't know man.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].  Alright.  How can I help you today?
PATIENT: Well you guys scheduled me for an appointment now.
DOCTOR: Well, I know.
PATIENT: Yes you did.
DOCTOR: You did, did you get a letter saying that to schedule this appointment or who scheduled it?
PATIENT: I got a letter that say you know to call them for appointment.
DOCTOR: We saw you in January and I put it in that you know, we probably didn't need to see you for another six months and that's in here.  I'm not sure who.
PATIENT: I don't know but you know maybe it was because I had like a little incident that happened.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well you know I have you know epilepsy.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then I had some seizures and they had to kind of be rushed to the hospital.  In fact, intensive care a couple of days.
DOCTOR: Now when was this?
PATIENT: That was June or July 16th actually.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: So that's probably good cause I wrote down a bunch of questions I've got actually.
DOCTOR: But I just saw you in January.
PATIENT: January of what?
DOCTOR: A couple months ago.
PATIENT: January.
DOCTOR: January 13th.
PATIENT: Right, it was right after that.
DOCTOR: Which hospital did you go to?
PATIENT: Little Company of Mary.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, that's why it's not in here.  Okay.  Alright.
PATIENT: Yeah cause I seen, I talked to the Billing Department and all that stuff anyway but yeah that was, actually that was good but otherwise, [REDACTED].  So that probably worked out good anyway.
DOCTOR: So did they increase your Keppra dose?
PATIENT: My what?
DOCTOR: Your seizure medication, did they increase that?
PATIENT: No they left it the same.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Actually but I'm on my last bottle cause they sent this, I just got this earlier today, for the, yeah yesterday as a matter of fact and they was telling me what's gonna be coming up in the future but it didn't have this on there, that's the main one I need.
DOCTOR: I can refill it.
PATIENT: Yeah that's good; out of all of them, that's the most important one.
DOCTOR: So did they give you any like information after discharging you from there, from being in the ICU?
PATIENT: Yeah well you know just, you know you check in with the VA and stuff.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so whenever you get admitted to other hospitals, you should bring in the paperwork.
PATIENT: Oh I did as a matter of fact.  I did bring it, yes I am glad you said.  I did bring it in cause I, at the time I was still kind of recovering myself and I brought in some paperwork.
DOCTOR: Did you bring it in last time I saw you?
PATIENT: No it was after that.
DOCTOR: So who did you bring it in to?
PATIENT: I gave it to the D Clinic, I mean the Red Clinic here, they said yeah okay we'll take it and put it in your file or something cause I was gonna ask if I could get a copy of it actually cause I didn't, you know I wasn't even thinking about that.
DOCTOR: We have nothing in here.
PATIENT: Cause yeah, cause I sure brought it in to them and I should have kept a copy of it myself but at that time I was still coming back to my own you know senses.
DOCTOR: So what day exactly were you admitted to Little Company of Mary?
PATIENT: Um January 16th.
DOCTOR: 16th.  When were you discharged?
PATIENT: The 18th.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Hmm.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Alright.  Well if you are able to get those, the paperwork or your records from Little Company of Mary, just bring it to your appointment so I can actually take a look at it.
PATIENT: I mean it’s here now somewhere.
DOCTOR: It's not in the computer so I'm not entirely sure.
PATIENT: I mean you know, I gave it to the personnel, that was at the desk which the person I don’t recall now you know but I certainly handed it in cause they said to be sure to hand it in, that's why I made it a point to bring it.
DOCTOR: When did you bring it, because since the last time I saw you this is your next appointment, you haven't been seen in between.
PATIENT: So I know, I just dropped off the paperwork.
DOCTOR: You just dropped off the paperwork?
PATIENT: Cause I had to go, yeah, because I went up to the Billing to find out you know cause they saying you know they'd take care of the cost of it so I actually went up to the Billing and I dropped that off as well.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well I mean, I don't really know what to say.  It's just that it's not in the computer so I'm not really sure where it went.
PATIENT: I don't know what to say either but I know I brought it here.
DOCTOR: Okay that's fine.
PATIENT: Okay.  But anyway, I did have, cause after that happened I was pretty scared, actually, yeah so.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Let's see, oh yeah the pill thing, we talked about that.
DOCTOR: I'll refill it.
PATIENT: For the seizures, yeah cause I'm like on the last bottle.
DOCTOR: I'll fill the refills for you.
PATIENT: Yeah and then uh I have to come, oh that was the thing what it was too, I had to come to get a cholesterol test.  I did that also and I wanted to see what my cholesterol level was cause I've been having blood [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Your bad cholesterol is 110, so your LDL is 110.  Your good cholesterol, which is your HDL is 78.
PATIENT: 110.  The good is what?
DOCTOR: 78.
PATIENT: Okay now what exactly does that mean?
DOCTOR: So, let me see you don't have any heart disease or diabetes so your cholesterol is fine.  We don't need to do anything with it.
PATIENT: Okay so then.
DOCTOR: Perfect.
PATIENT: So no problems with that okay.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Good, 100 bad and good.  What does that mean bad and good exactly.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I didn't really understood that.
DOCTOR: So there's a form.  There's just two forms of cholesterol in our body.  So the bad one, the LDL we want to get that lower usually uh and the good form we want it above 45.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So it's um, they just do different things to your arteries.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: So the bad ones make your arteries harder.
PATIENT: Hard, right.  So mine's pretty good.
DOCTOR: Yours is fine.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now okay, well now some of this I was writing stuff, like I said write stuff but by the time you come for your appointment.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Then you forget a lot of stuff.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: So it's really not as much as it looks like here on this paper.  Now let's see, like fasting stuff, you know like I guess I'm trying to you know really try to come to terms with this epilepsy thing.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So I know that’s pretty life-changing for me,so like I said now at the most I have five seizures in a row.  They had to call like the ambulance.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah, you know, I do admit to not taking the medication the way I should have.
DOCTOR: Yeah you have to take that Keppra.
PATIENT: Well you say yeah.
DOCTOR: So you missed a couple doses is that why, is that why?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's the only thing I could figure out.  You know but I don't have any memories or anything.  I have memories waking up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So but since that time, what's happening whether I eat or not then kind of like these semi-constant, mild headaches you know.  Like even now they just never seem to go away.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I find myself taking like maybe between four and six aspirin you know daily you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So I'm like, I got an appointment.
DOCTOR: Appointment with Neurology.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: For follow-up okay yeah I would definitely address that.
PATIENT: Yeah and they don't just seem to want to leave so uh and then I guess, now how I think somebody was telling me this, it was a friend of mine, said I don't know it looks like [REDACTED] and on your liver, you got liver disease or some stuck.  That's when I says let me write that down too. [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: No.  That's, just because you have a large stomach doesn't mean you have liver disease.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Your labs don't.
PATIENT: Right cause I say cause your skin you took with your stomach so that mean there must be something going with your liver or something.  No.
DOCTOR: No your liver is fine.  I'm just looking at your labs and there's nothing wrong with your liver.
PATIENT: Okay that's good, good, good, good.  Okay now okay doc I got this, no I just you know I need some advice, I’m working at the Heritage you know with their [REDACTED] so we know that puts a lot of, you know, kind of I don't know if it’s that carpal tunnel stuff.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now what is you could kind of do for it? I mean me, you know it's like some kind of exercises.
DOCTOR: For carpal tunnel?
PATIENT: Well to prevent I guess.  Say.
DOCTOR: I don't know.
PATIENT: I don't think I got it, but I don't want to get it either.  Cause sometime you know you get this kind of sore right in this area.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know come all the way here and bend it.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] in the process.  Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um there's not really anything to prevent carpal tunnel.  Um there are like splints that you can wear when you go to sleep but usually that's when people get carpal tunnel.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: When we have them wear the splints.  Um and then it keeps it from hurting so much.  Um but really there isn't anything to you know, people that sit at computers you know we tell them to rest their hand on something.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Sometimes it's just not possible.
PATIENT: Right, right.
DOCTOR: Unless you change their job to something different.
PATIENT: Right so the doctor gives them something where they squeeze like a tennis ball, cause I don't know if that would even do nothing first thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean it can't hurt you so, you know.
PATIENT: But do it help it?
DOCTOR: Not as far as I know.
PATIENT: Yeah right, okay.  And let's see okay, this thing I got this thing and I guess I hadn't even thought about it, something I just read.  Maybe I save this till the last week, but it seems like my heart has a real, like kind of a [REDACTED] feeling you know.
DOCTOR: A what feeling?
PATIENT: Like labored,maybe I guess.  I don't know I guess that's the only term I can use to describe it.  It's a pain like you just, saying you know how it usually pump the blood.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Now you [REDACTED] I don't want to say like strain or nothing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But it just, it didn’t seem [REDACTED] feel okay you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The [REDACTED] is up but a lot of them have to do with rebounding back from the you know the little incident I had.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So I feel like I'm doing okay now.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.
PATIENT: So and you know I guess you know maybe [REDACTED] especially first just feeling real tired.  You know.
DOCTOR: Yeah, so that can happen after you've had a seizure.
PATIENT: Yes, I understand, like back-to-back, you know so.  But yeah but that seem to be coming out okay I guess.  I figured it would probably take three of four months to come back to normal.
DOCTOR: It depends on the person.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: It varies so.
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s true.  Now this is one of the things I mean like I like [REDACTED] for this too.  This what I really find is kind of concerning me is uh I been having like you know the memory loss, short term and like long term memory loss.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Like what I did, a perfect example, like yesterday I was on the train you know and ran into my you know I know this person “oh yeah how you doing?”  I know him good but I don't know where I know him from.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: You know what I mean and, “don't you remember NAME?” Well no I really don't remember actually.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You [REDACTED] stuff that I probably should be able to but I don't seem to be able to do that.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: So that's like short term stuff and long term stuff.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: That's the kind you know bug me a little bit you know.
DOCTOR: I, I'm not 100% sure; the epilepsy sure could cause memory problems.
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Um but uh the neurologist would probably have a better idea.
PATIENT: Yeah, probably [REDACTED].  Yeah cause like I say I want to lose the weight and regain that thing.  Oh yeah and here's one too, on the refills I noticed on that, they were gonna send me the aspirin and there was, that's not on there either.  I supposed to had got it restarted sending I think on day one or two and then that's what it said and it said no more refills on it so.
DOCTOR: For the aspirin.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  You were taking 81?
PATIENT: Yeah cause when I call in and they said, well maybe I can [REDACTED] and so they called me over they said like no more refills, got to see the doctor on that and actually I just restarted it back up.  Cause.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That was one thing, plus the thing for seizure.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay [REDACTED] you get all like your lab results in here so you know.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You say the cholesterol's good.  No problem with the liver and none of that.
DOCTOR: Yeah, your labs all look fine.
PATIENT: And then I took a TB test not long ago, I guess that was good.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.  So the next appointment I got to worry about that.  Okay also now you know after I got the you know the script for the Levitra or vardenafil.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And then when I was at the Walmart, hell they got the generic version of that, you know the same thing and I was saying I wonder if that would be just as good as the regular stuff.  I know it sure is a lot less expensive.
DOCTOR: Yeah it's the same thing.
PATIENT: Yeah good, cause I went to price it at Osco they were like $120 some bucks.  I mean at Walmart $54, that's less than half the amount.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So if it's still, the same or just as good huh, okay.  Good.  I got a eye appointment coming up in May but uh, like for me I'm farsighted, I just need glasses and the last appointment like 200 you know, so I [REDACTED] for me cause I only wear them to read you know so that's why I already told them they got like reading glasses at the Dollar Store and all that and they just as good.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] prescription.
PATIENT: So I didn't know, it was $5.  I never really wear any except for to read.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So.  Guess so, I you know just as long as you get the correct.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Okay so we're gonna do, hmm, got that.  Oh okay, now here's one, now I got another question so let's just sign off you know for a while, you know AARP card.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Being over 50.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And they got like the insurance plan that so I say well I'll check with you guys say like I get the supplemental insurance and the reason being cause this that you got I see all these [REDACTED] my eyes, all the extra eyes all big under there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know I'd like the [REDACTED] the other day and I'd rather come here so it's not, you know, nothing to do with military related I mean you know you do that, but that was a while ago when I asked that so I don't know if they changed the procedure.
DOCTOR: I don't know anything about insurance.
PATIENT: Oh who would know?  Who do I talk to about that?
DOCTOR: Um probably the um, I don't know where you'd go.
PATIENT: Maybe the billing?
DOCTOR: Billing or means test.
PATIENT: Well I got to go to Billing anyway.
DOCTOR: Yeah, because I honestly I don't know about the insurance policies.
PATIENT: Okay.  Let's see, is that everything, yes sir, they wrote me and that's where they said come on in.  Now there is something else you know I been, you know on this side I'm barely able to eat, I don't really eat a lot.  One time I might go like the whole 24 hour period without really eating much and uh if I'm running behind and I'm like well, I say do I need to like kind of I don't know, I don’t know how to explain this exactly.
DOCTOR: Oh your weight's been pretty stable.
PATIENT: Yes, it stays pretty stable by and large you know.
DOCTOR: You know what I'm not worried about it.  If you were losing a ton of weight then I'd be worried about you not eating but.
PATIENT: Yeah you know, doctors don't like the whole 24 hour I might eat something like I eat something in the morning, it might be the next morning by the time that I might eat something again you know.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: You know I'm like well I make sure it ain't no cause for concern or anything.  I know everybody's body is different you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah I mean if you're not losing weight I wouldn't worry about it too much.
PATIENT: I don't seem to be.  Okay, let's see.  Oh this thing is kind of the size [REDACTED] for a while I was having like nausea or stuff.  It's all gone after that episode, you know with the.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: So.
DOCTOR: So it's gotten better?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's like you say I never even thought about it till I just read it.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But I’d say that this was maybe up to last week or something.  Okay, cross that one off.  Okay oh yeah now here's the other thing and I know with the, you know with me with this epilepsy, you know trying to come to grips with that thing and I know it can take a toll on the brain.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And stuff and you know the Chicago Bears dude just died, they probably got a CTE or something.  I don't know whether he got it from too many collisions to the head or something.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Damaged his brain.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I saying well maybe about me, like I say with this constant headache, such that even now it never really leaves.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Just sometimes it’s maybe more, you know more hurtful or painful at other times but it never leaves.
DOCTOR: This is different than hitting his head.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I believe so.
PATIENT: Yeah that's true but I guess like you know having the seizures now it's got to be something with the.
DOCTOR: Neurology.
PATIENT: Right, that's it.  You know what I mean and then uh seizures is those like you know kind of like mini-strokes or something, is that what that is?
DOCTOR: No.  So strokes are when you don't get enough blood flow to the brain.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Seizures are when um your brain fires signals kind of erratically.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: So it is different.
PATIENT: Fires signals erratically.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  So you know when, when we want to move our hand our brain sends signals to our arms.
PATIENT: Yeah I know.
DOCTOR: And our hands and when you have a seizures all these signals are going off, which is why people shake and have and people have different reactions to the seizures but because the brain is firing signals, kind of erratically, that's the way I can put it.
PATIENT: Right okay, okay.  That would be something to go with the neurology or something. Okay oh yeah, and then I had a thing with that paperwork so I don't know I'm fine I mean after I turned it in, right into the desk.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I mean it got to be somewhere.
DOCTOR: I mean they may put it in the computer eventually um.
PATIENT: Eventually.
DOCTOR: Uh I mean I have no idea.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But I don't know where, who has it or who rather did it but you know next time just bring it to the appointment so I see it and I can put it in my notes.
PATIENT: Yeah well I actually like, if I go I'll probably go over to the hospital, they probably got it, they probably give me a copy of it.
DOCTOR: Yeah you could get a copy of your medical records and then just bring it in when you get here.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.  Or what about when I come for my Neurology appointment.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't drop it off again.  Just bring it when you see me.
PATIENT: Okay.  Oh this is when I brought it in, I got it wrote down.  I brought it in on January 24th.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So that was like what, maybe like a couple weeks ago I don't know.  I know I just dropped it off.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And um I guess that sums it up actually.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  Um so I refilled your medications.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um do you want to pick them up or do you want them mailed to you?
PATIENT: Uh just you can mail them all, I gotta get to my ride.
DOCTOR: Alright so they'll be in the mail.  Let me go talk to the supervising doctor real quick and I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Do they have things in there with like the appointments cause I got another appointment today, I think I got see the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: They uh, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: What time is it now?
DOCTOR: It's almost 3.
PATIENT: Oh okay, that's good.
DOCTOR: We'll be done in time.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Let me go talk to my supervising doctor.
PATIENT: Uh-huh, alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  27:40  DOCTOR IN:  39:04)
DOCTOR: Alright, you're good to go.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: I put in the refills okay.
PATIENT: Okay yeah.  You know I did have one more question.  I reckon that's like the different milligram things on here.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And it was for the seizures but that's like 500 milligrams.
DOCTOR: Yep.
PATIENT: So that's twice a day.
DOCTOR: It’s twice a day?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I think its daily.
PATIENT: No, well it'll probably say on there, yes.  Cause that's why I I said, man does that seem like a lot?  I mean I don't really know what's a lot and what isn't you know.
DOCTOR: That's what they had you on then that’s was fine.
PATIENT: Yeah but I mean its 500, yeah let's make sure, when you put it that way.
DOCTOR: It is twice a day.
PATIENT: Right, so that's like 1000 mg per day.  Is that a high amount?
DOCTOR: It depends on whatever controls your seizures is right for you.
PATIENT: Well yeah, I understand that, I understand that. But I'm just saying that I'm just saying in general is that considered to be a large dosage.
DOCTOR: It's a pretty standard dose for people who have seizures.
PATIENT: But being once a day mostly?
DOCTOR: You know I'm not, between once a day and twice a day I'm not entirely sure, the 500 mg is kind of where we start people off on and we test people on up to 1000 twice a day.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: 1500 twice a day even so it just depends on what controls your seizures.
PATIENT: Right yeah, absolutely.  I said well I don't know if that's what it was but you know mild or normal or what kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So well okay then.
DOCTOR: Okay so we'll see you back in a couple months then.
PATIENT: Okay, you guys gonna send me a.
DOCTOR: Yep they'll send you a letter.
PATIENT: They'll send me yeah okay.  See here okay.  Alright thanks a lot doc.
DOCTOR: Oh no problem.
PATIENT: Go to the next appointment.  Uh-huh.
