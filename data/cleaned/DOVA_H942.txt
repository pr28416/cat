PATIENT: Oh they didn't give me nothing you know.  It helps a little with the high blood pressure medicine though, I mean it seems to help with it but it's like you know we got a MRI done.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Let me pull it up and see what it shows us here.  [REDACTED].  Okay so you had a CAT scan done because you had maybe fallen. No bleeds, that looks good.  Then they thought maybe you had um a vessel that looked a little abnormal so that's why they got the MRA and that was normal.
PATIENT: You know cause that didn't include, that didn't include my neck, though?
DOCTOR: MRA.
PATIENT: When I, when I took the slip and fall, the top portion, I mean my head hit the cement.

PATIENT: Oh you know what I haven't even taken it for, for a long time.  You know what I mean, I mean I can take it for a while and then I didn't take it for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I work nights and like uh it would just, you know I can't sleep the way it is and uh I would say I can't sleep so you know I stopped taking all the medicine, yeah I stopped taking everything and that's when I started getting you know crazy you know.
DOCTOR: Like having the seizures and.

DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] flakey and red and I looked you know, [REDACTED] more gross than normal.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED], the Naproxen and then the Xanax.  Okay so we'll get you start off with kind, okay so we can definitely put you back on the cholesterol medicine for sure.  That'll be an easy one for us to order, [REDACTED]pravastatin [REDACTED].  Uh do you think that the Cymbalta was helping?
PATIENT: Uh yeah you know what after I'd been off it, yeah because I was having so many aches and pains I mean I just things are popping and just hurting you know for now reason, I didn't understand it you know but that seemed to help but.
DOCTOR: And you were taking [REDACTED]
PATIENT: Yeah I've been off that for quite a while too.
DOCTOR: That uh, at the VA, because of our formulary, they might have been [REDACTED] to see it.  Let's [REDACTED] we will obviously put in a referral for you to go see them and then let's see here.  Well we can put you back on the lisinopril instead of this combination pill for sure.
PATIENT: Is that the [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: No the blood pressure, the guy you saw the other day put you on a different blood pressure medicine but we can switch you back on your same home blood pressure medicine and then yeah the Actos caused, the Actos 2 um, it looks like we put in a special request for but that's totally fine so we'll put that in uh Pharmacy non-formulary request.  Actos 15 mg daily by mouth 30 pills with refills by mail.  Diabetes previous regime [REDACTED].  Okay, good.  So we're gonna try to get the ball rolling here on the Actos and do you have a glucometer at home?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay good.
PATIENT: Um but I don’t have no strips.
DOCTOR: Okay so we'll put in for the [REDACTED]. That’s fine.  So let's see what we have here under.
PATIENT: Yeah they gave me one.
DOCTOR: Do you know precision monitor do you think cause I'm only allowed to refer precision [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh it's one of those television [REDACTED], they went ahead and gave me yeah [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: But yeah I'll put in an order for these strips and if they're the wrong ones.
PATIENT: I'll just send it back.
DOCTOR: Yeah you send them back.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And then we can have the pharmacist help you figure out what else.
PATIENT: Yeah I know there's one all around you don't have to calibrate and [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Alright I'll.
PATIENT: They get [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Let me see if they have [REDACTED] on our formulary here too and I'll just in a special request for that also.  Okay everything [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And I think it was not a generic [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Just get a [REDACTED].  Let's see if they have that or I'll just put in a non-formulary. [REDACTED] Yeah, well let me see if I can put in.  [REDACTED] another medication in the same...
PATIENT: Category.
DOCTOR: ...family, yeah so let's see [REDACTED] family [REDACTED] class by itself, [REDACTED].  So how, is your like, so have you been taking the penicillin since you were last seen?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah I'm taking it every day.  Yeah with what they gave me I mean I've been doing it every day, taking everything.  I mean I've been feeling better but I'm still in pain, you know when I took that fall.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And my head feels, but it feels like [REDACTED] fluid cause every time I try to move it I get, it takes time to get to the same place you know.
DOCTOR: Now have you ever been on any um like the more, so basically you're on a fancy version of sulfa urea which are medicines that help bring down blood sugar.  Have you ever been on like glyburide or glipizide before?  So I think I might just have you try one of those instead cause it's cheaper though okay.
PATIENT: Okay yeah.
DOCTOR: So the main side effect of any medicine is it's gonna lower your blood sugars.  It could make the blood sugars go too low so if you find yourself getting woozy.
PATIENT: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
DOCTOR: Dizzy, stop taking it and we'll just have you come in.  And it looks like you have hepatitis C.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How long has that been the case for?
PATIENT: Ever since I was in the military.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had any complications as far as you can tell?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] no.
DOCTOR: Have you ever seen a liver specialist?
PATIENT: No, no.  But that was one of the reasons I didn't want to take that Tylenol.
DOCTOR: Oh that makes sense yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah I mean [REDACTED] yeah.  I read up on that stuff and everything and you know I, even I a have friend that had cancer, he died you know so he gave me like six tablets of morphine because I was having so much pain.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: So that's how I hurt my back and then I hurt my back again you know so I fall [REDACTED] and I got a disk that doesn't want to [REDACTED]. I tried that.  You know I tried everything you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I went through the drinking route and that made me sicker.  I said you know screw everything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But what she's putting in I've been doing pretty good.
DOCTOR: Okay and so I'll put in for that and then the request for Actos.  I will put in the request for the Cymbalta but the worse that'll happen is that they'll say no.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You're going to get in to see the [REDACTED] so I'll put everything in just so they know, that's fine uh so Cymbalta 60 mg and now.
PATIENT: Oh um.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I've been having, for the past year, I think two years I've been having like a tickle in my throat and I've been coughing a lot within the past year and it's getting worse and worse.  I worked with asbestos for about 18 years.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: And I’m like coughing day and night. I don't smoke cigarettes you know and I don't know where this cough is coming from.
DOCTOR: How long has it been there for?
PATIENT: It's been getting real bad within the past couple months I mean like uh, hard time breathing, I have a gravely voice.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: Coughing you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED] in my throat.
DOCTOR: Okay we'll do some checking on that today so dry cough and how many months would you say this has been going on for?
PATIENT: Uh a good four months I would say.  It's been getting worse and worse to the point now I'm coughing day and night you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Is there anything specific that's triggering this cough?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: …bringing it about?
PATIENT: No, I mean it just seems like it's this dry cough, sometimes it's in the middle of the night, during the day.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] from sleep?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's causing me to get up four or five times a night just to cough you know what I mean.  I [REDACTED] cough drops by the bed.
DOCTOR: Any problems with um acid reflux or heartburn?
PATIENT: Not, you know what that was the first thing I took, Zantac.
DOCTOR: Oh Zantac yeah.
PATIENT: I took that, that seemed to help a little bit but no it still stayed there.
DOCTOR: Uh no history of reflux.
PATIENT: Oh no I had that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It didn't really have that for 20-30 years.
DOCTOR: Okay tried taking Zantac but cough is not improve.  And any issues with seasonal allergies?
PATIENT: No, none of that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Or feeling like a kind of a postnasal drip down the back of your throat?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: That's the only reason I'm [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay well one thing you are on lisinopril and all medications in that class can predispose people to cough so we could try switching the lisinopril to another medication that works similarly that is less likely to cause a cough.
PATIENT: But you see the thing is I was taking the lisinopril before and then the cough.
DOCTOR: Yeah but people can get it even then.  Oh no we're still gonna get a chest x-ray just to check out [REDACTED] certainly uh.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] okay.
DOCTOR: So we can and that's for cough.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay.  The gravely voice also uh is a little bit.
PATIENT: [REDACTED]  It builds up, it's kind of up here then it's down here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  We'll get a chest x-ray to see what's going on uh.  [REDACTED] Chest, two views [REDACTED] We'll get that done today so we'll see if anything is super obvious that we can do anything about right away and then okay.  So we talked about your cough and them um diabetes how's that going?
PATIENT: That seems like it's going okay.  You know I mean, I'm not really high, I've been in maybe [REDACTED] 180s, 210s, something like that you know [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What about first thing in the morning when you test it?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah in the morning you know it'll be 160, 180 you know.  Then you know after I eat and take the pills, you know it'll go up to 200 or something, then it'll come down some more.  Like I kept a log.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know [REDACTED] it seems like between 180 and like 220 yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay cause it looks like looking at your labs we got an A1c which was are all of your blood sugars you know the previous three months and your number in July was good.  So whatever you've been doing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Between July and April it was right, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh and then your cholesterol looks good.  You’re on the meds for cholesterol so we'll keep that going and then let's see for the Hep C we've gotta get you some labs uh, just basically, for people with Hep C every year we like to check the marker for liver cancer, it's just a blood test and we'll get an ultrasound of your liver to make sure that everything looks okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So these obviously don’t need to be done today um and your liver function tests were pretty good so.  Yeah we usually check that once a year just to make sure everything looks good so we'll get that stuff cooking.  So [REDACTED] get this done today and then we can forward the  ultrasound that they will contact you about. No emergency on that either.  [REDACTED] lab we can get that sent to [REDACTED].  Okay but in terms of let's see what's on the reminder's list and then we'll go over any other specific concerns. So uh Pneumovax, are you interested in getting a pneumonia shot?
