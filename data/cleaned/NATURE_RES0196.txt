DOCTOR: OK, and how about her living situation currently?
PATIENT: Ah should also at home with myself from her father and her younger sibling.
DOCTOR: OK. Uh, and uh? Any, anyone smoke in the house at all?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No. OK. Alright, so those are all the questions I had for her today, so definitely since there is a risk that she might be having another ear infection, we will need to do like a full physical examination. I'll have to look into her ear to see if I see any inflammation or perforation and then based on that we'll discuss some management. She may require some antibiotics like she has had before, but that will depend on what. I see on physical examination she has been having a fever so she might. And it's only been three days, right? So we may even do some conservative management and get her to take some maybe pain medications and then go from there. Or ear drops.
PATIENT: OK.
DOCTOR: Uh, but yeah, so we'll do the examination and then go from there. She said she has, besides the fever and that your pain she's not really having any other symptoms so? I don't think she needs to get tested for Covid right now, but that's something we can consider as well if she develops other symptoms.
PATIENT: OK, that sounds great. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Your Welcome. Take care
PATIENT: You too.
