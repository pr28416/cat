DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: How are you?
DOCTOR: Good how are you?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, hurting but come here.
DOCTOR: Okay, just give me one second to bring things up okay.
PATIENT: No problem.
DOCTOR: (Doctor working on computer from 9:39 - 12:17)  Okay, one second.
PATIENT: Take your time.
DOCTOR: (Doctor working on computer from 12:25 - 13:23, takes a phone call from 13:23 to 16:16)  Okay, so PATIENT what's going on?
PATIENT: AS far as the diabetes goes; I think I'm feeling a little better.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'm not going to say great but.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I had my hopes so.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: But uh.
DOCTOR: So how are your sugars?
PATIENT: Um, of course I bring you this.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Paperwork to let you see.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It seems like it's a slow process but it has gotten better I think anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Let's see, so you're taking 15 of Glargine at night now, is that right?
PATIENT: Correct.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Okay and no one's called you from the Pharmacy still?  None of the pharmacists have called you yet?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: I wonder what the deal is, let's see.
PATIENT: I remember you mentioning that someone.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Is supposed to call me from the Pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Yeah, I [REDACTED] anyway, let's see.  Okay, well.  I know it [REDACTED], so uh the reason I wants you to get involved with the pharmacist is that you know I'm only here every so often.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh and they can, they'll call you like once a week at least.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And they can adjust your medications much more frequently than I can.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and so I think it'll be good to have them involved too so we can get you exactly where we want you with your sugars.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay and in the meantime we'll have to do it ourselves, I'm happy to do it, I want someone who can even be more involved with you, you know every single week and touch base.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um so how are you feeling on the insulin, you doing okay?
PATIENT: Um I think so um.  Like I say it's.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] yeah.
PATIENT: It seems like I definitely monitor it, but it seems like it might be a slow process but um.
DOCTOR: But no numbers in the 300s anymore.
PATIENT: I know.
DOCTOR: But okay.
PATIENT: No, no.  I mean I had a couple of 400s too.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's when I really, really got concerned cause.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I felt maybe the first time I got a 400 you know it was just a bad day you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But after I got a couple of them.
DOCTOR: Yeah you had.
PATIENT: Yeah this is way too high.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Are you feeling any better?
PATIENT: A little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: A little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know um I'm still having problems with blurry vision but um I'm hoping that it's going to get a little better you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But uh as far as how I was feeling before.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You started the insulin.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Uh I definitely feel a little better than that.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know because it got so bad that um, I just didn't want to do anything.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  You were real [REDACTED] the last time you were here.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So uh I do appreciate that cause.
DOCTOR: Oh no problem.
PATIENT: I was trying to stay away from the insulin as long as I could too so.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes.
PATIENT: I completely understood that but uh it just seemed like the pills weren't helping at all.
DOCTOR: Right, yeah.  It was getting a little out of control so.  Well okay.  Uh what about, are you still urinating a lot or is that kind of doing a little better?
PATIENT: Um it's been a little bit better.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: As a matter of fact a couple of times I almost had some serious rest.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Um because I wasn't jumping up.  I mean there were nights when I was getting up five, six times.
DOCTOR: Yeah, when your sugars are up that that high, it's like a diuretic so.
PATIENT: Yeah so uh.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I think I've been getting up like two or three times.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: And that's definitely a improvement so.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: That's good.
PATIENT: Like I say, I'm just hoping that you know as time goes on it gets a little better and a little better.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And a little better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely.  Now so I wonder if you've seen an eye doctor, yeah it was in the summer of 2011 was the last time?
PATIENT: Yeah I think they told me that you can go once a year I think it is.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I think I'm not due to go back to see them until September.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: 2012.
DOCTOR: When did you notice that your vision was getting blurry?
PATIENT: Oh way before um my sugar went up.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: It just, it wasn't continuous then alright.  I would have a few days where they seemed to be blurry and.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I would put some uh Visine in them.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know and uh cold compresses on my eyes that.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And that would seem to clear it up a little bit.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But um as time has gone on and when my sugars went up so high, seemed like they got blurry and uh they didn't want to clear up.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay.  Um I do think it'll get better as your sugars go down.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So um, we could see if we could get you in a little earlier with the opticians and that would be a good thing too.  So I'll put in a consult in for them okay.
PATIENT: Yeah, they gave me um a pair of glasses and you know Hines wasn't doing that at first so I was more than appreciative for that.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Um.
DOCTOR: That's good also if they want to change I think we could do that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: And have them check you out as well.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  [REDACTED].  And I'm looking at your thyroid here.
PATIENT: Yeah I just had the test this month.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Now you don't have any, um you don't notice that your heart was beating quickly or anything have you?
PATIENT: Uh it's.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: As a matter of fact, it's, to me it's an undescribable feeling um, I'm not necessarily sure if it's that my heart is beating fast but uh it's a funny feeling.  It's hard to describe um.  Kind of feels like gas but it's not, it's like, I can't describe it.  I really tried to put my finger on it but um.
DOCTOR: Hmm.  Like someone is sitting on your chest kind of?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's I don't know if it's respiratory or what because I've been having problems with my sinuses, I was going to ask you about that too but.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um, I can't really describe what it is and that's unusual for me but.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But um I want to say like a flushed feeling but it's in the chest area and it's um.
DOCTOR: Hmm, how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh um maybe the last couple of weeks I think you know and it's not continuous, it's just.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Some mornings or some afternoons uh, I thought possibly it could be gas cause I've been trying to eat a little more.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause the weight loss has been unbearable you know.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Although I think I've gained a pound or two.
DOCTOR: Oh good.
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Your sugars too, if they're better controlled you should be able to gain weight a little better.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So having them higher.
PATIENT: I think they told me it was 140 something the last time I was here.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  145 today so that's a little.
PATIENT: Yeah she told me it was 153 today.
DOCTOR: Oh good.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: That's awesome.
PATIENT: Well I've been eating like a little pig so.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah that's a good.
PATIENT: Even when I didn't want it you know cause I got a sister who tells me that I need to eat.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's chemistry but um I don't know if it was the sugar but I really, really didn't have, it's the pain too so, but I really didn't have the desire to eat a whole lot so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I mean I was missing meals and not even care so.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I think it's gotten a little better.
DOCTOR: Okay.  What's going on with your pain?
PATIENT: Oh, well the um, I got the plate and screws in the front of my neck.
DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah.
PATIENT: And screws in the back.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And I forgot about the screw in my hip and.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The weather's been.
DOCTOR: It's been acting up.
PATIENT: So yeah it's been going back and forth, back and forth and I've been trying to cut back on the um Vicodin.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: You know because I've been taking it a long time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Um and the pain has been rough.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It really has but um if I'm in pain I'm trying not to.
DOCTOR: Take the Vicodin.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Do you have enough?
PATIENT: Uh yeah because I haven't been taking it.
DOCTOR: You haven't been taking it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So, if I didn't [REDACTED] I would be sure to listen.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know I've had pills in my hand a couple of times and I put them up because I said no.
DOCTOR: It's probably not worth it yeah, okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Well we don't want you to be miserable so let's you know.
PATIENT: Too late.
DOCTOR: Oh, well you can take that.
PATIENT: I know my sis told me the same thing.
DOCTOR: Take it you need it.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: She said the same thing but you know you got to take them.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So I also think it might have affected my appetite so.
DOCTOR: The pills?
PATIENT: Yeah that's one of the reasons.
DOCTOR: Yeah pain can affect the appetite too so.
PATIENT: Yeah so.
DOCTOR: You know yourself the best so you shouldn't be living in horrible pain because the pain medicine is there when you need it okay.
PATIENT: I will.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Believe me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Definitely after I eat I'll.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I'll take it cause I will not take it on an empty stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Well, I want to go up on your insulin again.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh now your thyroid, so they did the ultrasound.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So we kind of picked this up incidentally so we did the scan of your tests and they said there's nothing going on with your weight loss or anything.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And they noticed that you have what they're calling like a multi-nodule goiter um that they thought you may need a CT scan but that's not the best test to look at it so.
PATIENT: Oh don't tell me that cause I had uh, a aunt who had a goiter.  I was thinking that my mother had one too but my aunt was way out of control.
DOCTOR: Was it big?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, so that sort of thing shouldn't happen anymore uh nowadays we don't let it get that bad.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Well she was intense, she older, much different generation.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: Definitely tried to have her, um I think doctors had suggested surgery and she refused.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: All kind of ways, she just would not have it.
DOCTOR: It just kind of got out of control huh.
PATIENT: Oh it was big.
DOCTOR: Oh okay, well you don’t have to worry about it's getting big.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: We've got lots of medicine for it if you need it nowadays.
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: Uh but I don't, it's a little, it's a little interesting so do you have an enlarged thyroid and you do have some nodules in it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But the biggest one is 1.7 cm which is small um and your thyroid function tests are normal.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so and I need to look this up actually, I don't remember what the [REDACTED].  I do think we should probably just have you see Endocrinology who are thyroid doctors um particularly because of you know your weight loss and everything.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The thyroid is kind of intimately involved with weight.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and so I'd probably like to get their opinion just to make sure um see what they think about this.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay um I think that we're some progress with your sugars and everything.  Actually I think then we'll be really good.  Have you ever seen Endocrine here with us?
PATIENT: Possibly um, probably when I first started coming over I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm going to look back because Endocrinology, let's see.
Yeah I don't see anything about your thyroid so yeah so they’re the thyroid experts um.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So let me go talk to one of the other doctors real quick too about this.
PATIENT: I know what your, I think about three or four years ago.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: One of the doctors had given me some medicine for sinuses and I'm hoping that you can find.
DOCTOR: Your sinuses have been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: Okay remind me before you leave okay.
PATIENT: I shall do that.
DOCTOR: Before you go okay, I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Okie dokie.
(DOCTOR OUT:  31:15  DOCTOR IN:  36:34)
DOCTOR: Alright.  So I talked with one of the other doctors.  He agrees you should probably see the endocrinologist about this nodule.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Especially with your family history and stuff so I'll have you set you up okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.  I think my mom's had one too but uh hers was not as pronounced as the one.
DOCTOR: As your aunt.
PATIENT: Aunt yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um okay so in terms of your Glargine I want you to go up to 20 units.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You're at 15 right now okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and then so [REDACTED] I said that you could get in touch with the pharmacist who would kind of talk to you every week.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Well maybe they tried to call and.
DOCTOR: I don't think so because it wasn't registered yet on the [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Okay so.  I got a bad habit of screening the salespeople who be trying to get.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah.
PATIENT: To sell you stuff all the time.
DOCTOR: Yeah we all do that, that's alright.  What you can do is  go up to 20 for the next week.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And if your numbers are still above 120.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You can go up another 2 units okay, so you can go to like 22.
PATIENT: So how long are we talking about uh for a week?
DOCTOR: Yeah do 20 for a week.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: See how you do um and then if it's still, if your numbers are still consistently above 120, they're still in the high 100s or even 200s.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Then go up to 22 for the next week.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then call me and let me know how you're doing.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And we'll just keep going up until we get your numbers where we want them but slowly.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I mean you've been right so far, you know why would I challenge you, no way.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: No, I was so happy for it to come down I just.
DOCTOR: Yeah no this is great, it looks like, especially the last two days or so, yes the 22nd looks good.
PATIENT: I was wondering because I been having so much orthopedic surgery alright.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Cause usually when I get up in the morning uh, generally the first thing I do is brush the teeth and stuff and then I do a little exercise and I was wondering was the exercise causing it to.
DOCTOR: Your sugars no.
PATIENT: I mean the blood glucose, not necessarily my sugar but.
DOCTOR: Oh, no I think that's actually supposed to do the opposite.
PATIENT: That's what I thought.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know yeah but I started um exercising after I did the blood glucose cause I'm saying I need to check everything.
DOCTOR: Oh.
PATIENT: I'm not sure so.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh yeah, no it shouldn’t have a negative affect on your sugars but so what's going on with your sinuses?
PATIENT: Um like I said about three or four years ago the doctor I had at the time had told me I needed this medicine for my sinuses and.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Um I took it for, I don't know two months or so and it seemed like my sinuses got better and of course just like most men I stopped taking the medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: All of a sudden now it just seems like they're giving me the blues and I think I've had quite a few sinus headaches too with uh, so I was just wondering if there's something you can't find.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You can't find what they was giving me, it was a little teeny weeny white pill that they were giving me.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um and what kind of symptoms are you having?  Are you having like a runny nose?
PATIENT: Runny nose um, a little mucous and it doesn't seem like cold mucous.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It's uh it's hard to describe.  I know that uh because I been cutting back on smoking.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I noticed though when I smoke a regular cigarettes.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It seemed to dry them up a little bit so.
DOCTOR: Do you think it's all coming from your nose and then you're having problems with it dripping down your throat and [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I haven't had, I haven't had a whole lot dripping down the throat.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I have to be honest but I definitely know that it gets to the point sometime where I can't breathe.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know through my nose.
DOCTOR: Yeah, do you have a lot of pain like in your [REDACTED].
PATIENT: A little bit in the cheeks and mostly up in here.
DOCTOR: Yeah okay.
PATIENT: So I'm, I'm.
DOCTOR: Do you have any itching in your eyes or watery that you notice?
PATIENT: Oh, you know cause I'm blurry-eyed half the time anyway so.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah but I think the Visine probably help a little bit with that too.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: So um.
DOCTOR: Well there's lots of different sinus medications so we need to decide what would be best for you.  Um, one of the, easiest medications, well all of the sinus medicines have some side effects but um.
PATIENT: Like what?
DOCTOR: Um like a lot of them are antihistamines.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So they can make you tired and they can, if you're on them for too long you know.
PATIENT: Well we don't need to be.
DOCTOR: When you go off of them, so one of safest things for sinuses is nasal steroids um.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And it gets rid of all that kind of congestion.
PATIENT: I think I had um years ago um I had the doctor give me something that was nasal and I had to squirt it up.
DOCTOR: Put it in your nose a couple of times.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Was that, I think was that um what's the word I'm looking for steroid?
DOCTOR: Yeah so, yeah.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Something I would give you is the steroid.  I forget which one you had here at the VA.
PATIENT: Now would that react the same way as the um the steroid oral medicine?
DOCTOR: No.
PATIENT: Okay cause.
DOCTOR: No yeah steroids orally you can't take for a long time they have a lot of side effects.
PATIENT: I couldn't take it at all.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's what originally popped my.
DOCTOR: Sugars up yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: No this is just you definitely no this is just locally.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So yeah you'll be fine with your sugars, it won't make it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So let's start with that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Cause the other ones I don't really like that much you know these are the ones we can start on.
PATIENT: Like I said.
DOCTOR: So let's start with the nasal spray okay.
PATIENT: You've been right so far why would I.
DOCTOR: You're trying to convince me here.
PATIENT: No I'm not, no I'm not.
DOCTOR: So let me see what kind you had here in your chart.  Okay so you had it looks like flunisolide, that's the brand that they have here.  You're going to do two sprays in each nostril twice a day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: First thing when you wake up in the morning and then sometime you know halfway through the day so.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Now you just want to have them mail it or do you want to pick it up?
PATIENT: Yeah please.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I did the other one your way, the um the insulin.
DOCTOR: Did it take a long time?
PATIENT: Oh brother.
DOCTOR: Oh yeah, did you have to wait down there.
PATIENT: Oh right.  But I remember that's the way it's always been.
DOCTOR: Oh okay.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I'd rather do the mail cause I'm saying God, Jesus.
DOCTOR: Yeah gotcha.  Okay so try your Glargine, we'll send the nasal steroids.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then a week from now you can come in too.
PATIENT: You mean I just stick it on my envelope to make sure that the old man don't forget.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And that's that.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay and then if you're at 22 and your sugars are still higher than 120.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Then just call me and we'll go definitely go up but we'll talk first.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then the Endocrinology people will call you and they can get you in for your thyroid.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um and it's not anything you know emergent so.
PATIENT: Okay.  Now that wouldn't because I got those plate and screws in my neck.
DOCTOR: No, no.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: The CT scan they did was overall clear but the ultrasound was specifically looking right at the thyroid and you definitely have some nodules.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so the question is if they need to be biopsied or not so, your thyroid function is normal.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I know you're not hyperthyroid or hypothyroid um, there are people that have that problem.
PATIENT: When you say hypo what is it?
DOCTOR: Hyperthyroid is when you have too much thyroid hormones.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So some people will be um, it can cause weight loss, it can cause people to be a little bit hyper and agitated and stuff and so then sometimes we have to get rid of it either surgically or with medicine get rid of the thyroid.  More times in older people are hypothyroid which means they don't make enough thyroid hormones.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And usually you're tired and you put on weight and stuff like that and so we just give them that kind of a hormone.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Your thyroid function test you actually looked like they were normal.  So your thyroid is working correctly.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: You just have these little nodules in it.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And so a lot of times we just biopsy them to make sure that they’re you know not cancerous or anything.
PATIENT: Now it's just [REDACTED] alright.  If they have to be biopsies that mean they have to go in through my throat?
DOCTOR: It's a [REDACTED], I don't deal with that, it's pretty easy they will use that ultrasound probe again.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And it's just a needle, it's a needle biopsy so it's in your throat but it's not like cutting your throat or anything, they just stick a needle into it and they would numb up the whole area and stuff.
PATIENT: That's the optimum word numb [REDACTED].  Yeah yeah and then definitely they would pay attention to the plate and screws right?
DOCTOR: Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They do this all the time so but can remind them, of course.
PATIENT: Oh I will.
DOCTOR: Yeah but the thyroid actually is right here, right up front.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: So yeah it's sort of [REDACTED] and they will use the imaging so they can see exactly where they're going.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Um I'm not sure the size of yours is kind on the border where they might just want to watch it or they may biopsy it right off the bat.  If it's greater than 2 centimeters they would definitely biopsy it and yours was like 1.7 so you're kind of in that grey zone of you know, not totally sure what they'll do.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Alright good to see you again.
PATIENT: Same here.
DOCTOR: I think we'll see you in a little longer this time.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let's go like 4-6 months.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So we'll talk on the phone about your sugars okay.
PATIENT: Alrighty.
DOCTOR: Alright.
PATIENT: Thank you doc I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You take care, no problem have a good weekend.
PATIENT: You do the same.
DOCTOR: Do know where to check out?
PATIENT: Uh always at the desk.

PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright you take care.
