DOCTOR: Sure, you can ask it.
PATIENT: Okay.  The reason why I don't want to get back on that what isosorbide.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Because I can't take Viagra with that.
DOCTOR: Right you definitely cannot.
PATIENT: Right so that's why I don't want to get back on it cause I want to get back, I’m trying to get Viagra.
DOCTOR: Well you still can't get back on Viagra because it's dangerous for your heart condition but definitely not when your taking that medication.  What about hydralazine?
PATIENT: I'm taking that.
DOCTOR: Okay.  The reason why I don't want to put you back on the Viagra to be honest is that if you were to have a heart attack and you needed nitrates that'd be really dangerous.  Um are you taking the metoprolol still?
PATIENT: Yeah.  So they say I don't need to have sex and that's it.
DOCTOR: Well I don't want to tell you don't have sex.
PATIENT: Yeah [REDACTED] I can't even get that [REDACTED] to work.  One of the pills, one of them come.
DOCTOR: And you can't have sex without it?
PATIENT: Uh uh.
DOCTOR: Well I'll talk to DOCTOR I just with all the medications that you're taking, probably that's probably one of the reasons too.
PATIENT: Yeah I know.
DOCTOR: Let me talk to DOCTOR.  Okay I think that we got through all your medications enough so we're in a good place now.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll sign all of this.
PATIENT: I had took blood work would that let you know if I need the insulin, I mean not the insulin, the anemia shot or do I have to wait till I go back upstairs.
DOCTOR: Wait until you go back upstairs, but I think your blood work was fine actually that's why I don't want to um.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Let me look.  I'll look at it but I remember I was glancing at it before and I think it looked fine.
PATIENT: And the less shots I take that's cool with me.  Oh, I need some, I used to get this nasal spray.  It's uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah why do you need the nasal spray?
PATIENT: Cause I get, my nose shuts off at night, it closes.  I can't hardly breathe.  I used to get it but then I ran out and never refilled it uh I forgot the name of it.  It was [REDACTED], something like that.  When the bottle say to use by such and such I throwed it away.  I should have kept it.  I forgot the name of it.
DOCTOR: Was it flunisolide, looks like they're sending, [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: No it just squirt like that, squeeze it up there, it's like a solution uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah I think that's flunisolide [REDACTED].
PATIENT: It's the name like deep C.
DOCTOR: Hmm, I don't know that doesn't sound familiar but I'll give you something.  We'll be fine; you take two sprays up your nose with that.
PATIENT: What's the name of that?
DOCTOR: Flunisolide it's the thing that you put up your nose.  I think it'll help you.
PATIENT: Okay.  You can mail that to me.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  And what else, oh how have your blood sugars been?
PATIENT: Oh since I take the shot at night once a day it works out pretty good.
DOCTOR: When did you start taking this at night?  That was a while ago right?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So the problem is, is what has it been?
PATIENT: It's been, if I go to sleep with my sugar at 200 I can last till 6 o'clock in the morning but if I go less than 200 about 1 o'clock if I don't eat a half a sandwich or something at night at about 1 or 12 o'clock, by 6 in the morning in the morning it be about 40 something.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: So since I keep it at 200 I wake up it be a decent thing in the morning, like 90 to 108, 102.
DOCTOR: How much are you taking?
PATIENT: Uh I think 12 units.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: But it varies from 12 to 14 I think.
DOCTOR: Do you ever feel when your sugar goes low?
PATIENT: Nope.  Except if I'm sitting at home - walking I might just fall down I know it get me.
DOCTOR: So do you take any um, any insulin with food with your.
PATIENT: With [REDACTED]?.
DOCTOR: What food, with your meals?
PATIENT: Oh uh I takes it at bedtime.  This is after dinner.
DOCTOR: Oh so you don't take it ever with the meals?
PATIENT: No this one.
DOCTOR: But that your….
PATIENT: This is 10 o'clock at night before I go to bed so I done ate dinner and everything.
DOCTOR: So um do you take your finger stick, how often do you check your glucose during the day?
PATIENT: Twice.
DOCTOR: So once in the morning and once at night?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: What about in the midday?
PATIENT: No I ain’t punching myself that many times, that's why I only have one shot.  I get.
DOCTOR: Would you be willing to take more than one shot?
PATIENT: No.  So what I do is I just eat lunch anyway, you know what I'm saying.  Cause I know it usually, it be, go down between that time, between 7 in the morning and 12 I know it's about time to eat so I then ate so there wasn't no reason to take it.  But do you want me to go back to it?
DOCTOR: Well I just wanted you to see, cause it's weird that your sugars are down so low at night.  I was hoping that we could get you to check your sugar maybe three or four times a day for the next couple weeks and then we can adjust it.
PATIENT: Adjust it again?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: But you know, when am I gonna get one of those things where you don’t gotta stick yourself.
DOCTOR: Well, when one is invented.
PATIENT: They have one, it's on TV it says put it on your arm and wait till your blood [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: That's not real I don't think, anyway.  Any more problems with bleeding from your rectum?  You had that last time.

PATIENT: No every, I get it when I go back in there.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: When I be constipated I got to go back in there and strain.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: But then after I get that first, excuse me, poop out, I'll be okay.
DOCTOR: Alright so what I want you to do, seriously, is do you think for two weeks you could take [REDACTED] and check your blood sugars three or four times a day and then come back in and see our pharmacist to adjust your insulin?

DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: In two weeks.  Would you do it, just for two weeks?
