PATIENT: You know what, I was telling you I was telling the nurse that I, you know the last thing [REDACTED] pancreatitis.
DOCTOR: Pancreatitis?
PATIENT: I been having that problem lately.
DOCTOR: Have you been drinking a lot of alcohol?
PATIENT: I don't drink alcohol.  I mean I'll have a cocktail but I haven't have nothing like that to drink.
DOCTOR: Well when you had the pancreatitis did they ever tell you what caused it?  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I don't, you know they went down just through my throat twice.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: The second time they thought they were gonna do biopsies but they found nothing, it was just inflamed.  Now I don't know what caused me two weeks ago and I'm scared to tell DOCTOR because last year at this time she kept me in here five days on broth.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I was not a happy camper.
DOCTOR: Well understandable, but you know we have to do what’s best for you [REDACTED] came here.
PATIENT: I know but if I can't eat in the evening and then just after twelve o’clock, but she didn’t want me on nothin.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I’m talking about.  Broth with breakfast, lunch and dinner I went crazy.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  That's what happens when you have pancreatitis.  You having that problem again?
PATIENT: Well I think.
DOCTOR: Go ahead and sit up for me.
PATIENT: I've had three times when I threw up, one time I'm like whoa I finished my breakfast and everything I had just come out and I was fine.
DOCTOR: Alright.  So you felt better after you threw up?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Alright take your shoes off I want to shoe DOCTOR your feet and I'll be right back okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay.
(DOCTOR OUT:  45:14  DOCTOR IN:  52:40)
DOCTOR: Hi.
PATIENT: Hey DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Where is your sugar log?
DOCTOR: Told you she'd ask you.
PATIENT: You were supposed to tell her that, well you can.
DOCTOR: Oh I was supposed to lie to her?  (Laughter)
PATIENT: No, no, not lie but just tell her so she wouldn't come, cause she jumps, she hits me.
DOCTOR: So really PATIENT we went over this last time and so you did not bring the log, you are taking your insulin but you don't check so how am I going to adjust those readings uh, sugar readings the insulin reading.  Okay so we'll have a pharmacist see you.  Now you are coming two times, next after January 1st, one is the Liver Clinic; one is the Nauk Clinic so one of those days you can have the nurse to see you.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Make it on the 4th, I think I will be back by then so we can check your sugars and adjust your insulin then.
PATIENT: So you want me to draw the blood today or what?
DOCTOR: No you don't need any blood tests.  I'm talking about you checking your sugars at home the different times of the day and do you have those sheets or you want me to give you new ones?
PATIENT: I have those [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay so that we can have at least three or four readings of each column.
PATIENT: So you want me to do it three times a day?
DOCTOR: No one time a day but switch the times each day.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: So uh see your glycosylated is 8.5 which is bad.  Then you have problems with your feet and so forth and your neuropathy is never going to get better if your diabetes stays like this.
PATIENT: But you know what DOCTOR some days they'll feel fine and then I think when the weather changes, later like at night and it seems like.
DOCTOR: No that's part of neuropathy and it's from your diabetes.  As long as your diabetes continues to be doing poorly it will only get worse.  Okay but if you get it controlled it may actually get better but if we don't do anything, no matter how many medicines I give you it's not going to be better.  It's linked.  If your diabetes is not controlled this is going to get worse.
PATIENT: And I'm trying to lose the weight cause.
DOCTOR: Well that's good.  You do diet, you do exercise, you do your insulin, those are all the things that will control it.  Just not increasing the medicine will help you in terms of your insulin.  So you really need to do all of the things similarly but at the same time you need to check your sugar so that it [REDACTED] you where you are and if it goes up then we can adjust your medications.
PATIENT: I know that.
DOCTOR: But in terms of Vicodin that's the other pain medication so that would not be the medicine for your diabetic neuropathy.
PATIENT: No but it helps.
DOCTOR: What I can do is, DOCTOR was mentioning to you that we can increase the gabapentin to 900 three times a day [REDACTED] sleepy already.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] sleepy.
DOCTOR: Good. So it's a neuropathy medication.
PATIENT: That doesn’t bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay so we'll increase that.  I can give you like 15-30 pills with no refills and this is not for the neuropathy pain.
PATIENT: No, no.
DOCTOR: It’s for the ankle pain if you need it but no refills.  I don't want to get in the habit of taking Vicodin for regular pain.
PATIENT: And like I told her, I still have a few pills from the last time you gave me some.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Then what I'm saying for, the medicine that is not for this and I don't want you to, I will issue the pain medication okay.
PATIENT: Alright.  So now you supposed to be going over on vacation this year.
DOCTOR: Next week.
PATIENT: Where you going?
DOCTOR: Nowhere.
PATIENT: You’re just going to relax?
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Take care, happy holidays.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Take care.
PATIENT: Bye.
DOCTOR: Alright [REDACTED].  I have been trying.  I have all these records I've got to go through.

PATIENT: Now you probably said he didn't bring it, you been had, I know you telling me, setting me up.
DOCTOR: You know I do what I can to set you up, that's my bad.  Alright so here's what we're gonna do.
PATIENT: She didn't say, where, where you log at.  She always gets me.  She's been doing that since 2000, you know that.
DOCTOR: I know.
PATIENT: She's been my, I love DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: She is pretty awesome.
PATIENT: Well I swear by her.
DOCTOR: She is pretty awesome.
PATIENT: Every time I, I can call her from home, she says okay you come in to the clinic, I'll be waiting here and I go pop and I get here and she say [REDACTED] and she treats you like a little kid just drag me down the hall and next thing I know I’m in the Emergency Room and I'm admitted to the hospital.
DOCTOR: I know because she cares about you.
PATIENT: Yes she does.
DOCTOR: Alright so here's what we're gonna do.  You already have some appointments coming up. You've got on January 12th you've got your liver appointment.
PATIENT: I thought that was on the 4th she said.  She just said.
DOCTOR: The 4th is with Podiatry.
PATIENT: Podiatry and what else?
DOCTOR: The 4th you've got Podiatry and I want you to have them schedule you for a Diabetic Pharm D on January 4th as well.
PATIENT: Yeah to see DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  So ask them to do that up front and bring your labs or your logs.  Um we need to reschedule your orthopedic appointment because you missed it on December 4th.
PATIENT: But you know what I knew there was something that I needed to do, I knew it.
DOCTOR: No that's okay.
PATIENT: But I thought I scheduled it for today because I knew I was going to be here early.
DOCTOR: Right.  Well they can make it for you.
PATIENT: And they're there on Mondays and Fridays only.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: So I knew it.
DOCTOR: You can have them reschedule that for you up front.  So we'll reschedule your Ortho appointment.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: We'll schedule your eye doctor.
PATIENT: I need to reschedule with Ortho.
DOCTOR: Ophthalmology for the eye doctor, Orthopedics um Diabetes with the Pharm Dy and now for your uh pain in your eye they're increasing your gabapentin to 800 mg three times a day.
PATIENT: I thought she said 900?
DOCTOR: You know you already have them and I mean you can do that way this time.  Um well I'll give you the 900 three times a day.  Um then the other thing is we want to get some imaging; basically it's called arterial blood study in your lower extremities of your legs.  Um because we're worried about some of this might arterial as well as the pain you're describing.
PATIENT: Arterial means?
DOCTOR: So your arteries are the blood vessels that take blood into the body.
PATIENT: That's what I'm wondering you know because right after the surgery.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: It was you know, just before I blacked out in surgery I remember seeing my feet go up and the way they tied the toes to hang that foot up there for them to do.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I'm like.
DOCTOR: Well what we'll do is we'll have them do that for you so that we can make sure that your arteries are doing okay.
PATIENT: Please.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Thank you.  Cause I'm hurting here, I mean like here.  Okay the whole foot used to look like that.
DOCTOR: No, no.  Only some of the [REDACTED] you know was due to the injury that you had and what not so let's.
PATIENT: And actually do a lotion, a lotion to put the sock on and it takes it right off.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.

PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You can try to schedule with her if you want.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] in three months I'll forget something you know.
DOCTOR: Really.
PATIENT: And I figure if I.
DOCTOR: How early do you want [REDACTED] you can always schedule [REDACTED]
PATIENT: What about, why can't we go every month and a half instead of three months?
DOCTOR: I mean I don't think you need to see me every month and a half.
PATIENT: Why?
DOCTOR: Because you don't have that many medical problems for you to.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: If you want to see me every month and half.
PATIENT: You know what, yes I do because I want to get, I want to get cut down on insulin.
DOCTOR: So that's not gonna happen by you seeing me more often though.
PATIENT: Yes it will because I'll be bringing in my readings and you'll be telling me about those others.
DOCTOR: Yeah but you see the thing is your labs right now that you've been getting like your A1c which shows up your um your blood sugar over what the average over a three month period is high.
PATIENT: Well what should that be?
DOCTOR: It should be less than 7.
PATIENT: 8.5, that's nothing.
DOCTOR: High.
PATIENT: It used to be 13 or higher.
DOCTOR: I know its better.
PATIENT: So come on, you just you want jack with me (laughter).
DOCTOR: Well it used to be but that just mean you know we need to keep working at it.  The only way you're gonna come off of your medications is to lose more weight.
PATIENT: Now what medication am I taking for the diabetes?
DOCTOR: The insulin.  And so the only way this is gonna work is, the only way you can get your blood sugar where it's at goal is by using a log and the only way you can end up requiring less medications is to lose more weight.
PATIENT: I'm trying to do that but now but the reason I was saying if I come in every month and a half then I could draw some blood and I'll feel better knowing that after which I'll know where I'm at.
DOCTOR: Well we can't check this laboratory more than every three months anyway. This lab, it gives you an average of your blood sugars for three months, for a three month period so we wouldn't check it more than every three months.  Does that make sense?  You can come and see me more often if you want I just don't think it's going to change our management of you.
PATIENT: I think it will.
DOCTOR: Okay if you want to you're more than welcome to call and schedule something more often.
PATIENT: It's like I'm being monitored you know.  I feel more comfortable.
DOCTOR: If you feel more comfortable then absolutely you can come more often as you like.
PATIENT: I feel comfortable knowing that I'm being monitored properly and that yes I am doing the right thing.
DOCTOR: Good.
PATIENT: And I'm 51; I want to see 61, 71, 81.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: 91, I want to keep going.  I want to keep you know feeling like I'm feeling right now.  You know I want to have motivation some day.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
