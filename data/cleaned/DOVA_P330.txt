DOCTOR: It’s not going to get better, though.
PATIENT: Huh?
DOCTOR: It’s not going to get better.
PATIENT: Well (laughter).

DOCTOR: Why are you so nervous about it?
PATIENT: I don't know, I don't, I don't.
DOCTOR: It's not painful, they're gonna give you medications to make you sleepy.
PATIENT: I understand that but I mean.
DOCTOR: It's one day and you can get it out of your mind for years to come.
PATIENT: Years to come.  Maybe I got to put that in my mind.
DOCTOR: It’s not like you are going to do this every year.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Think of it as [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Once you get it done, they find something, they get rid of it and then you don't have to worry about colon cancer for years to come.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Um the preparation um when they give it to you, you have to take it um put it in the frig and by like uh use one of those lemonade flavoring for the water.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: You can buy like one of those packets and just mix it in.
PATIENT: Mix it in it okay.
DOCTOR: Um and everyone has to go through this.  So you're definitely not alone.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] with the [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: With everything, the procedure, everyone gets nervous.  I mean haven't, you haven't had it done before so you don't know what to expect you know it's part of it but, you're a strong man.
PATIENT: Right.
DOCTOR: Right.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm a strong man.  [REDACTED] drug free. Never did any drugs.
DOCTOR: I don't want you to start drinking because of it though uh.
PATIENT: Yeah I had got away from it.  I had got away from it and it's like up until this month, for some reason, I just, I don't know.  I have like uh, what I say, aggressive thoughts.
DOCTOR: Did you get the flu shot today?
PATIENT: No I don't do that stuff no.
DOCTOR: No, why not?
PATIENT: No I never got it.  The last flu shot I got was in the service 30 years ago.
DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: I don't do it.  I ain't had the flu in years.
DOCTOR: So when do you have your appointment for the colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Two weeks, I think its two weeks.  It's on the 20th or something [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little on the high side.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Is it from this [REDACTED] or me worrying? Which one?
DOCTOR: Any pain right now?
PATIENT: [REDACTED] when I stand up and walk but when I go to sitting down it's [REDACTED] you know.  I know it's going to be a little pain.  They said I need refills on all my medicine too.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Yeah I need all my medicine.
DOCTOR: You’re taking . . . [REDACTED] you're just taking the amlodipine and the hydrochlorothiazide?  Oh and losartan.

PATIENT: No nothing today, uh uh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I'm, I got up in good spirits, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: We can keep an eye on it.  Um how's your diet?
PATIENT: Uh [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: So how about the, feeling depressed do you think it's because of the same colonoscopy thing or it's something else?
PATIENT: I think it's that.
DOCTOR: So is it depression or is it anxiety?
PATIENT: Well I think it’s depression because.
DOCTOR: Why are you depressed?
PATIENT: Because I'm just, I have a brother with colon cancer.
DOCTOR: And how old is he?
PATIENT: And he's 49.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I don't know.
DOCTOR: So is that more why you are afraid of getting the colonoscopy?
PATIENT: That and the procedure itself I mean, it’s why - I'm [REDACTED] for all of that crazy stuff I don't know.
DOCTOR: Yeah well, every single man has to go through.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Yeah but I understand.
DOCTOR: Besides, you have to talk about this with [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Now you're gonna, hopefully you'll know that you’re undergoing the colonoscopy [REDACTED] you know.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: But I mean do you think you're just anxious cause you're afraid of it or stuff like that?
PATIENT: Yeah, I'd say just afraid of it you know.  Cause I was fine right before we got into this month.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And now, I don’t know, it’s just [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: I mean it's understandable.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] it's definitely understandable that you are going to feel scared and anxious, especially when you have a brother that's not that much younger than you are.
PATIENT: Yeah my brother is 49.
DOCTOR: Did he have surgery for it?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How's he doing?
PATIENT: He ain’t doing good at all.
DOCTOR: Did he end up getting chemotherapy or anything yet?
PATIENT: He's already, he doing chemo and he on dialysis too.
DOCTOR: From the cancer or from something else?
PATIENT: No he was on dialysis before the cancer.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.  Is he a diabetic?
PATIENT: No I think it was drinking.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And uh he's doing chemo now.  Some days you can't get both of them, so.  He's a little bitty guy, I mean, I’m a big guy.  He’s got, he might weighs 105 pounds.
DOCTOR: So I mean, you are healthier, it seems.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Right now if they find something, if you have you know, if you haven't had problems with constipation  [REDACTED] chances are that if they find something they should be able to [REDACTED] you know without having to go [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Well I understand the blockages, I don't have those.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: I don't.
DOCTOR: And that doesn't mean if they go in there they're going to find anything but there's always the chance of them you know, sometimes cancer starts like you know a little pimple.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: And then it starts growing.  But if they find something like that they'll just take it out.
PATIENT: They'll just.
DOCTOR: And then send it out for analysis and figure out whatever it is.
PATIENT: And then there's the chance it ain't nothing.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  There's a chance that you’re totally clean.
PATIENT: Oh.
DOCTOR: And if they don't see anything then you're clear for ten years to come.
PATIENT: There's no other symptoms, no problem.
DOCTOR: But sometimes, sometimes you don't need to have symptoms, that’s why we do it starting at 50.  You and me, anyone can have it starting [REDACTED] without even knowing it.
PATIENT: Oh okay.
DOCTOR: It's better to prevent something than to be sorry later.
PATIENT: That’s right.
DOCTOR: So were you ever on antidepressants at any point in the past?
PATIENT: Uh no I was taking some uh, well I take some mental health meds now.
DOCTOR: You're taking trazodone?

PATIENT: Okay, cause if I'm under the cover it really sends it off.
DOCTOR: When you have something on top?
PATIENT: No when I got nothing like when I'm sleeping and [REDACTED] under the cover.
DOCTOR: When you go under the covers?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  And that is because you are stimulating the nerves on the skin.
PATIENT: Oh.

PATIENT: Exactly.  Exactly.
DOCTOR: So.

DOCTOR: Hmm.
PATIENT: And I got that electric shock where they stick you.
DOCTOR: It still could be [REDACTED], still could be mononeuritis multiplex.  It really could be you know usually there's an explanation for that.  Um you know it could just, it could be like you know, I don't know it; I know all these things are common.  It could just be a bad coincidence that we have all these like things like the Bell’s Palsy and the neuralgias, I know that's three different things I know.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].  What was?
DOCTOR: You know it could be.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It could be viral too you know I mean it could be like uh, um.  We, well did we check for like, just to be really complete, did we check for all this stuff including HIV and all that, did we do that?  The HIV level.

PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Yeah uh, some of these nerve things you know we just don't know why they come about but we did a pretty extensive work-up.  We checked uh, to be sure we checked a lot of things and we sent you to the neurologist and they're scratching their heads as well [REDACTED] when I walk by there.
DOCTOR: So with everything, I'm going to increase the amitriptyline.
PATIENT: What's that?
DOCTOR: The one you take at bedtime or the trazodone.

DOCTOR: Does that help?
PATIENT: Well it kept me from being dry and scratching it you know I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: It's kind of like a salve.  Can I get refills on Levitra?
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: Then I'll stay happy.
DOCTOR: As long as you don't end the colonoscopy appointment, I'll renew them.
PATIENT: Alright I'll go to the appointment.  Fifteen days.  So do you, there's a chance this leg is what’s causing this Bell’s Palsy[REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Hmm.  What the leg?

PATIENT: Oh okay, okay, alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect.  So I've renewed everything.  Let me make sure you can pick this one at the window and mail them and then I'll see you back in four months um.  But if you want, you can come in like a month just to get your blood pressure checked, just to make sure it's really not this high.
PATIENT: But don't take those two pills, just keep taking one.
DOCTOR: Just keep taking what you’re taking.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Except for the amitriptyline and you're gonna see that the dose is doubled.
