DOCTOR: PATIENT?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: How you doing?
PATIENT: I was bringing some technical, technical [REDACTED].  How you doing big guy?
DOCTOR: Good how you doing?
PATIENT: Good.
DOCTOR: Um vertigo gone yet?
PATIENT: Uh not too well.
DOCTOR: Oh oh.
PATIENT: And I took it.  [REDACTED] I got some more coming up but, when I first meeting with them, actually [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: After you were done.
PATIENT: Yeah so [REDACTED].  But I made it out to my car and fell flat on my face and I fell like a bird.  Thank God there was a guy there just parking.  He come running over and he figured I died or something.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: And he helped me up.
DOCTOR: How many times have you actually passed out since we last saw each other?
PATIENT: Just that once.
DOCTOR: Just that one time?  Okay.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Because all the manipulations.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.  I gotta renew some of my prescriptions.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: And is there such an animal, a test where I don't know how to say it, testosterone?
DOCTOR: Testosterone?
PATIENT: Yeah testosterone, what my level is?
DOCTOR: Yeah why do you uh?
PATIENT: Cause nothings working.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Oh [REDACTED].
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: How are uh things going you know?  I know that you were under a lot of stress and a lot of.
PATIENT: Yeah see my wife's doing much better now.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: She still can't [REDACTED] so I don't know, problems with her pain and what not but we're doing better than we were.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: I went back to work thank God.  That took a little pressure off.
DOCTOR: Good.  Uh so nothing, have you seen the Urology doctor?
PATIENT: Yeah one time.
DOCTOR: One time you did?
PATIENT: Yeah a while back you sent me there.
DOCTOR: That's right and what did they say?
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: No [REDACTED].  They just said to increase the Levitra to 20 mg but that's not doing anything for you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We might have something better, let me check.  How is your energy?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Your strength is okay?  Like your muscle strength?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You don't feel weak or anything?
PATIENT: Uh uh, no.  [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: What's that?
PATIENT: I’m eating and sleeping better.
DOCTOR: That's good.  They actually tested your testosterone levels back in January 2009 um and they were normal.  It was normal. So I don't think that's the problem.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'm kind of out of things to do.  You know I've checked you for metabolic and [REDACTED].  The only thing I can have you do is see the Urology doctors to see if there are any other options out there.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: For you.
PATIENT: Any other pill that will work, Viagra or?
DOCTOR: Viagra, I don't know if I, they don't carry Viagra here but the medicine that, the Levitra is the same thing uh-huh.
PATIENT: The same thing.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I wouldn't expect it to.
PATIENT: Well I've never changed, whatever you were sending me or can't you go up, is that what we did?
DOCTOR: Now you're getting 20 mg.
PATIENT: Okay.  I think I was.  I had to stop taking it cause it wasn't doing anything.
DOCTOR: Sure.  Now you're taking that how soon before?
PATIENT: Half an hour or an hour whatever.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So you're doing that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: I don't know, maybe we'll just have you talk with the Urology doctors again now that you're on the, you know tell them you're on the maximum dose of the Levitra and you haven't noticed any change.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Uh now you haven't had any headaches or anything like that, blurry vision, double vision?
PATIENT: Nope.
DOCTOR: Okay.  And your blood pressure, you've been off the lisinopril now correct?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure was not too bad here.
PATIENT: No I know it was 141 over.
DOCTOR: 76 which is not horrible, did you just walk in?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Yeah we'll recheck it here but I'm guessing that you could probably stay off the lisinopril.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Uh well this appointment was made primarily to follow up with the vertigo to see how you've been doing with that.  Would you say it’s better?  Cause I remember last time you were getting frequent attacks so if you've only had one attack after the manipulation.
PATIENT: I have to watch everything.  Well especially when I'm in bed and try to get out of bed.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: That's when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay.  We're going to give you a pill called meclizine that might help some of the symptoms.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: It's not going to eliminate it all together but it might help some of it.
PATIENT: Alright, I've learned by just taking things a little slower and I'm [REDACTED] most of the time anyway but by slowing down a little bit I think it's helped and think before I move in bed.  But if I try to get up too quick I might as well lay on over on the floor.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Not out but down I mean I got, the other day I really, the first time I'd been sick to my stomach you know when the vertigo hit and it's been a long time since that's happened.  I didn't throw up but I was real close.
DOCTOR: Sure.  And you mentioned you've had an MRI and a MRA the correct?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Um you don't have those reports do you?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Maybe the next time we see each other just remember to bring those in.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So I can get them into the VA System so we have records of them.
PATIENT: Fine.
DOCTOR: Let me put the notes in that we're going to try the correct dose of the meclizine.  It's not a medication that is used commonly but you know, but my attending said [REDACTED].  Okay it's generally used for like motion sickness and things like that.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: But it's also used for vertigo.  It can cause you to be a little bit drowsy, that's probably the main side effect.
PATIENT: I'll be careful with it.
DOCTOR: We're going to start, we'll start with the lowest dose 25 mg um once a day and we're going to give you a 50 mg tablet and you can cut that in half.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And see if that eliminates it.  Um if you notice that you're still getting a lot of vertigo, but maybe it's helping a little bit, you can take up to 100 mg a day.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: In divided doses so maybe do, you know if it's helping a little bit but um it's not away maybe you can increase it after about a week or so to 25 mg twice a day and try that.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Let's try it for a week with just the 25 mg.  If it's doing nothing then I don't know, like if it's making you drowsy then just stop it.
PATIENT: Yeah okay.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay.  Um and then everything else we kind of took care of the last visit. I just renewed…
PATIENT: I am feeling a bit better, now that the pressure's off with my wife.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Stress really does affect you.  I know it was dragging me down.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: We're doing fine.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Alright.
DOCTOR: Let's get your blood pressure again.  [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Not bad [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: It’s freezing outside.
PATIENT: [REDACTED] parking lot [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Oh.  Alright just rest your arm against me.  128/72.  That’s good blood pressure, better than mine.  Deep breaths for me now.  You don’t have any troubles with [REDACTED].
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay good.  Alright.  We're going to, we'll try the meclizine and hopefully that works for you.  When is your next appointment with Physical Therapy?
PATIENT: I think it's coming in another week.  I got a whole bunch [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Okay good, good.  I want you to see the Urology doctors.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um.
PATIENT: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Just have a seat for just one second while I talk to my attending.
PATIENT: Alright.
(DOCTOR OUT:  34:50  DOCTOR IN:  43:07)
DOCTOR: Alright so I talked with DOCTOR about things.  He agreed with trying the meclizine.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: But he's also recommending a couple other things.  Uh the omeprazole, the acid blocker that you're on.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Why was that started?
PATIENT: Because I get terrible reflux.
DOCTOR: Okay.  When was that started?
PATIENT: A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Have you ever tried going without it?
PATIENT: Yep.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Have you tried things like Zantac before?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Omeprazole, if you've been on it for a while it can definitely contribute to some vertigo and dizziness and things like that.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: So it might be worth trying, you know trying you without it and then I'm going to check Zantac here um and then try the Zantac.  It's a similar, it's not a proton-pump inhibitor but it still blocks the acid production in your stomach.  We don't have Zantac here but you can get it over-the-counter.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Um so stop the omeprazole; try taking the Zantac and see if that makes any difference.  Obviously if your acid reflux becomes severe and you don't notice any difference in the.
PATIENT: Switch back.
DOCTOR: Yeah then switch back to the omeprazole.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: Lastly, you know he, even though you just had a MRI, you know we don't have any head imaging here so he was hoping that we could get a CAT scan of your noggin within the next week or so.  Um it's a CT scan so you know you're in and out, it’s not like an MRI.  Just to make sure, especially with your history of head and neck cancer.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: The likelihood of this being anything is like nothing, but we're just being more conservative.
PATIENT: Sure.
DOCTOR: Well, I'm going to, are you able to get that done?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay I'll order it then.  So definitely stay off the it's always good when you're getting rid of medications.
PATIENT: Yeah exactly.
DOCTOR: So stay off the lisinopril, looks like your blood pressure doesn't need any more help.
PATIENT: I haven’t had that in a long time.
DOCTOR: Good and then um we'll try you off the omeprazole.
PATIENT: The Zantac you take it just once a day or?
DOCTOR: Yeah, just once a day.  Then we'll send you back to the Urology doctor, okay?  Unfortunately, I don't have any other, I mean there are some other drugs that they're more familiar with and they can check on that and then hopefully things will go well.  Oh there was one other thing that I want, he was also saying uh for, to get you know what's causing the bad erectile dysfunction and what's causing this extreme vertigo.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: There are two main systems in the body.  The sympathetic and parasympathetic, it's kind of like the sympathetic, more like the fight or flight, and the parasympathetic it slows down the metabolic processes so sometimes you might have a malfunction of those two systems um and that could explain the vertigo.  It can also explain the erectile dysfunction and how you test for that is something called autonomic testing uh which um they just do various tests like if you're going to be on a table and then put you up and down.  It is a pretty extensive test.  They normally last about an hour, so it might get us some information that there's an impairment in the autonomic system.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And then if there is, the Neurology doctors might have something similar [REDACTED].  I think it'd be worth getting that done too.  So a CT of the head, autonomic testing, stop the omeprazole, try the Zantac and have you see the urology doctor.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: All of your medicines are renewed.  I don't have to see you back for another four months or so okay.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: I'll let you know if something comes up before then.
PATIENT: Great.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Yeah.
PATIENT: 49:06.
Time is 9:08.
