PATIENT: Yeah I stopped putting the cream.
DOCTOR: Why?
PATIENT: It kept it too moist and it kept it itchy.
DOCTOR: Did it make it better?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: No.  I don't think this is fungal. [REDACTED]I think we should try a little topical steroid and get him in to see Dermatology because they may need to biopsy this.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] for dermatitis from just.
DOCTOR: Yes.
DOCTOR: This kind of treat him like that.
PATIENT: And there's just a lot of fluid that's been coming out of it.

DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: Apply that twice a day and right in the small of your back, is it itchy?
PATIENT: It's burning and itchy.
DOCTOR: Burning and itchy.
PATIENT: Oh burning yeah.

PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Oh.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] that's where it is. [REDACTED] in his pants line too and a little bit higher.
DOCTOR: So let's, what so, even if it's diffuse if you're putting the medicine on it, I think it should have gotten better.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
DOCTOR: So I'm want to, or at least a little bit. We should have seen something. So, if you've only been putting the steroids [REDACTED] and does your back get better with the steroids [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Just a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's put, I'm going to give you some different steroids for here and on your back twice a day.  I want to get you into Dermatology.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: And ask them.  Now the problem that I see is that if it becomes infected.  Now see some of these lesions that are open and weeping and what happens is that bacteria comes in and causes infection.  Do you know what that feels like?  It will be stinky, fevers, chills.
PATIENT: That's what I'm getting, fevers.
