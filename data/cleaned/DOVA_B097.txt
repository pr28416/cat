(Someone knocks on the door, doctor talks with that person 97:02 - 98:08)

PATIENT: Hieroglyphics.
DOCTOR: Uh you know, it's like you work in code, you got to [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah AND you're always so busy.

DOCTOR: Well we'll do the set up.
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: If you set it yourself I'd be impressed.
PATIENT: Yeah left-handed in the mirror.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay so go ahead, I’m sorry.
PATIENT: Um I feel like I have restless leg and I was seeing on the TV um restless leg syndrome.
DOCTOR: Uh-huh.
PATIENT: And I don't have it every day but I um definitely when I'm laying down have it you know and that's when a lot of times I'll get up and take another metoprolol.
DOCTOR: Okay, it's sorry about that it's a Code Blue or something.  Alright.
PATIENT: And that's when I'll get up and take a metoprolol and then stay up for a while and what I'll do is try to relax or something.
DOCTOR: Okay so do you feel, during the day not at night when you're sleeping I mean during the day do you feel like you're anxious or that you have [REDACTED], do you notice anything going on?  Do you feel like that?
PATIENT: Uh not every day.  Not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um but you know and some days you know I am uh you know kind of uh really wound up.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: I feel yeah.
DOCTOR: Uh do you find yourself, like, a worrier?
PATIENT: No.
DOCTOR: Okay so a lot of what you're telling me it seems like its stress versus anxiety.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: There's what we call generalized anxiety disorder.  [REDACTED] and how they have a lot of anxiety and how they use anxiety they kind of manifest you know it might be provocations.  [REDACTED] things like that usually from like you have episodes where you can have a lot of sweating, you can't sleep, sleep disturbances, you're like worrying a lot, [REDACTED].
PATIENT: But I'm not a worrier.  It's like in each of these cases going back since the day we met I feel like its Christmas morning all, you know all the time.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You've heard me say that.
DOCTOR: Yes.
PATIENT: You know and um you know I've just had this you know this feeling um.
DOCTOR: Just a lot of [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I just don't know, I mean I don't know what it is but I just feel like you know there's some sort of, almost like an excitement feeling.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know um.
DOCTOR: You know what I think?  So the metoprolol that's you know a medicine to manage your heart rate, blood pressure.
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: A side effect is that um usually a bad side effect in someone as young as you are, um they tend to be tired.  But it seems to be to your benefit.
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: You know that side effect, which is not a bad thing as long as you don't take too much of it but I feel that I think it’d be better to address with the meds that act on actual stress so there are certain meds that relax you and certain meds that act on the stressors and then you know when it comes down to it there are things you can do to relax yourself.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: Uh what kind of hobbies do you have?
PATIENT: Um well there are things that I use to relax myself and to try to take away those feelings is stretching.
DOCTOR: Okay.  Alright.  Do you do like yoga or just like regular stretching?
PATIENT: Like regular stretching.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know um like my ghetto version of yoga.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: You know like I'll sit on the floor and actually try to you know stretch out the muscles you know [REDACTED] stuff you know.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Um and but that's why sometimes when sometimes when my heart rate gets elevated like I told you um then I take a metoprolol because I feel that my heart rate goes back down on that, cause that's part of helping me relax.
DOCTOR: So do you feel anxious at the time [REDACTED]?
PATIENT: Uh-huh.
DOCTOR: Okay.  So there's one part of [REDACTED] anxiety, there's another part of is that has to do with mood and that is um like certain people you know like normal whatever that is, most people have like a mood profile where like you have peaks and valleys you know it kind of like this, and then you have people get a little more fluctuating, so you go up really high you feel so great, you can just do anything and you have all these projects at once, a lot of energy but then at certain times you go down and you just get feel, you don’t want to move, you don’t want to get out of bed, you know you just feel sort of [REDACTED].
PATIENT: That's like textbook, that’s how I look.
DOCTOR: I'm actually one of those people I mean.  Some days I get up and I just want to, like I want to run, I want to put stuff together, I want to do all the work that I have to do for the month, I could probably do it right now and on other days I'm honest, I just want to pull down the shades [REDACTED]
PATIENT: And that's one of the things that I'm not complaining about is you know sometimes I'm top of the world and I'll be you know I’ll take apart all the closets in the house [REDACTED]
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: Did this whole house, I'm organizing all the tables, I got roast in the stove, I'm doing really good and then what I don't get done, if it doesn't get done in the next couple days, it just sits there because [REDACTED].
DOCTOR: [REDACTED].
PATIENT: I feel too overwhelmed you know and I don't know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Yeah.
PATIENT: You know.
DOCTOR: Yeah [REDACTED] affect.  The [REDACTED] for that is called [REDACTED].
(Someone knocks on the door and the doctor talks with the person 104:00 - 105:4)
PATIENT: He needs some metoprolol.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Okay, alright so.  But the people that deal with that is the psych doc. Those kinds of meds, the mood meds and the anxiety meds.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm on that venlafaxine and we recently upped the dosage on that to 300 and uh man I've been doing much better with depression with that.
DOCTOR: So you think, they monitor, they have you um you know like depression here but seeing as how you  [REDACTED], you have really I would call you more like [REDACTED] it's you know for some reason I feel it's more like a [REDACTED] and then if use more, you know super [REDACTED] or clinically depressed or clinically manic they  call that bipolar.
PATIENT: Yeah I'm not that.
DOCTOR: So it's bipolar or [REDACTED] and then [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Yeah I get  anxiety that's what it is.
DOCTOR: Yeah so we'll see so what I'll do is [REDACTED].
PATIENT: Uh.
DOCTOR: Yeah I would go over that with them and I'll also look at their notes and [REDACTED] get up and you're kind of depressed but [REDACTED] like okay that's [REDACTED] see what they say and I'm glad you brought it up and uh you know I think we've talked about it before, but if the anxiety [REDACTED].  I wouldn't take metoprolol for it uh I'll increase what you're doing for your stress relief.
PATIENT: Hmm.
DOCTOR: [REDACTED] I don't know if you increase activity, I don't know if you go out with your wife or you could go out.  [REDACTED] you like doing that?
PATIENT: Yeah.
DOCTOR: Which is more than [REDACTED] specific problem.  So what other hobbies you got?
PATIENT: Um I ride my bike a lot and it relates to having anxiety.  It's just that when I ride my back, it's to the extreme.
DOCTOR: Okay.
PATIENT: Like from my house on the southside to Naperville and back or I'll go to Elgin and back, you know it's a 14 hour bike ride so I'll go you know.
DOCTOR: Exercise is good for stress, it's very good.
PATIENT: Yeah.  Um sometimes, you know like I said 85 miles on the bicycle and uh you know if it's one of those days like I said  you know there's no way I'm getting on the bike and I'm going.
DOCTOR: Yeah.  Well um okay that's good.  So exercise is good, you know hobbies are good, stress relievers are good and all of that's good and the next time you see them is, are you're down for an appointment them in the near future?
