PATIENT F049
That was the last visit with you?

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
Yes it was about that time.

DOCTOR F049
Around four or four and a half months maybe.  

PATIENT F049
Yeah.

DOCTOR F049
How have things been going at home?

PATIENT F049
Oh pretty well.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
I have some problems stemming from my childhood not only from the trauma from my childhood.

DOCTOR F049
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F049
And the service too.

DOCTOR F049
Uh-huh.  Is that what you're seeing Psychology for?

PATIENT F049
Yes.

DOCTOR F049
Okay.

PATIENT F049
I'm just @@@.

DOCTOR F049
Okay.

PATIENT F049
@@@ help me.

DOCTOR F049
Well let's see, how are your medicines doing?

PATIENT F049
Uh they seem to be working alright.  I take uh; I take this saw palmetto, saw palmetto.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.  Uh-huh.

PATIENT F049
When I have trouble with my urinating and uh.

DOCTOR F049
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F049
I have that problem and it seems to help kind of.

DOCTOR F049
The saw palmetto okay.

PATIENT F049
Yeah.

DOCTOR F049
And uh your inhalers you're still taking?

PATIENT F049
Yes I, I take them as needed.

DOCTOR F049
Well those we want you to be taking all the time.

PATIENT F049
Well the ones at home I uh, the I have two of them at home I take uh.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
Let's see there's just this uh machine.

DOCTOR F049
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F049
And then there's the one that uh I forget what it's called right now.

DOCTOR F049
Now there's Symbicort.

PATIENT F049
Symbicort.

DOCTOR F049
That's the one that you take twice a day and there's just one you take once a day.

PATIENT F049
Symbicort, the one that I take once a day seems to be more effective than the one I used to take twice a day.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah I mean they're all good in combinations with each other though.

PATIENT F049
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F049
So even though one may make you feel better right away, it's good in the long term to keep using them like that.

PATIENT F049
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F049
They're different types of medicines.

PATIENT F049
Yes.

DOCTOR F049
But you're taking both of those every day?

PATIENT F049
Uh actually I'm only taking one now; I forget the name of it uh, uh right now let's see.  I should have written this down but.

DOCTOR F049
Uh-huh.  Yeah um I'd like for you to take all of them though um.  Is there a reason you're not taking the other one?

PATIENT F049
Well it just didn't seem to be very effective and uh so I finally gave it up .

DOCTOR F049
Okay.  I'd like you to take both though if you can.

PATIENT F049
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR F049
So I think it's the twice a day one you're probably not taking.

PATIENT F049
Yeah.

DOCTOR F049
You didn't bring your medicines with you you said?

PATIENT F049
No I didn't, I should've, I'm sorry.

DOCTOR F049
Okay, okay.  Well today do you need any medicines?  Do you need that inhaler we're talking about or any of your inhalers or your?

PATIENT F049
Well the pocket inhalers I'm pretty well.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
Supplied with them and the ones at home I had the medication for those too.

DOCTOR F049
And you have the other inhaler, the one you're not using, you have that one still?

PATIENT F049
Yeah, I actually have that yeah.

DOCTOR F049
Okay and then the you know the albuterol one, that one probably you @@@ carry.

PATIENT F049
I'm really not sure just how much of any of those I have left so I haven't used them for quite a while actually.

DOCTOR F049
Okay I'll make sure you have refills of everything.  Do you need anything mailed to you right now?

PATIENT F049
Uh.

DOCTOR F049
It looks like you ran out of your cholesterol pill and all this stuff you haven't been taking for a while.

PATIENT F049
Well the trouble is when they mail the.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
Medication if it won't fit in the mailbox I have to drive the ten miles round trip to pick it up at the post office.

DOCTOR F049
Oh.  Your cholesterol pill and your prostate pill, looks like you're not taking those anymore is that right or?

PATIENT F049

DOCTOR F049

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.  You used to get that Meals on Wheels right but you didn't feel like you needed it.

PATIENT F049
No that's, yeah I didn't think that worked that well.

DOCTOR F049
Okay.  Yeah your weight is up a little bit so that's good.  It's up about four pounds since I saw you last.

PATIENT F049
Around here, I need to lose that weight, that doesn't really do me any good.  I need to watch my diet.  I need to improve on my diet, eat more of that natural foods and.

And not so many processed foods.

DOCTOR F049
You're eating a couple meals a day though still?

At least two or three meals.

DOCTOR F049
Okay.  Okay.  Uh and you're still paying all your own bills, getting your own groceries, all that stuff?

PATIENT F049
Yes sir.

DOCTOR F049
Still driving?

PATIENT F049

DOCTOR F049
Okay, alright um.  How has your urine been?

PATIENT F049
Uh if I don't take the, uh when I don't take these saw palmettos sometimes I have trouble urinating.

DOCTOR F049
Okay.

PATIENT F049
But that seemed to improve.

DOCTOR F049
Okay.

PATIENT F049
Help me improve but the uh the medications that they.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
Prescribed.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
That is not effective.

DOCTOR F049
Is not working hmm.  Uh we could maybe try a different medicine you know.  I mean it sounds like you have an enlarged prostate that's where your urine issues are coming from.

PATIENT F049
Yeah.

DOCTOR F049
Um we could try a different medicine if that one didn't work.

PATIENT F049
Maybe that would be, that might.

DOCTOR F049
And we can mail that to you and see if it'll help, what do you think?

PATIENT F049
Yeah, it might be a good idea yes.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah okay.  Let's see, but you stopped taking that prostate pill though right?

PATIENT F049
Beg pardon?

DOCTOR F049
Are you still taking the prostate pill or did you stop taking that?

PATIENT F049
Uh yeah I'm still taking the ones that are prescribed, all the medication that's been prescribed I take usually.

DOCTOR F049
Okay.  Uh let's see uh I'm just going through your labs here you had last time.  You still see the psychiatrist right?

PATIENT F049
I'm seeing a psychologist.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
Somewhat near where I live.

DOCTOR F049
Okay.

PATIENT F049
Psychologist, not a psychiatrist.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.  Alright.

PATIENT F049
The psychiatrist is usually for a little more serious problems I guess aren't they?

DOCTOR F049
Uh-huh, yeah, more uh with medication and stuff like that.

PATIENT F049
Yeah.

DOCTOR F049
And you're not smoking anymore right?

PATIENT F049
No I quit smoking.

DOCTOR F049
Did you get the flu shot?

PATIENT F049
Yes I got the flu; I got the flu shot this morning yes.

DOCTOR F049
Oh good.  The nurse just gave it to you?  Alright and let me see what else today, yeah so a few of the things, one we'll try a different prostate pill and then I want you to take both of those inhalers.

PATIENT F049
Yes okay.

DOCTOR F049
Okay one is twice a day and one is once a day and the other one just when you need it that you carry around with you.

PATIENT F049
Yeah, yeah, yeah okay sir.

DOCTOR F049
I think even though you don't feel like it helps you I think it will in the long term help your lungs.  Um, alright your cholesterol you take them uh @@@ get it checked.

PATIENT F049
Sometimes I think quite often you hear it on the TV.

DOCTOR F049
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F049
If the medication makes them, causes them to think about suicide.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
Cause most people, I don't think, think about suicide, they start taking some of this medications they prescribe and then it causes them to think about committing suicide for some reason.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
So with medication for psychology and psychiatric problems I don't believe in it very much.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.  Okay.  

PATIENT F049
Maybe if it's a real serious problem so they might believe that people might think of doing irrational things but maybe uh, maybe some of that medication will just kind of numb them so they won't think about it.

DOCTOR F049
Yeah.

PATIENT F049
It kind of shocked me the one right if it causes you to think about suicide then they say call us without delay.

DOCTOR F049
Right.  Alright so then let me go talk with my attending doctor and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT F049
Pardon?

DOCTOR F049
Let me talk with the other doctor and I'll be back.

PATIENT F049
Yeah, yeah, okay fine.

DOCTOR F049
Other questions for me or no?

PATIENT F049
Pardon?

DOCTOR F049
Do you have any questions for me or no?

PATIENT F049
I'm sorry?

DOCTOR F049
Any questions for me or no?

PATIENT F049
No I guess not right now, that I can think of right now.

DOCTOR F049
Oh okay, alright, I'll be right back, stay here.
