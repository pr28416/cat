PATIENT T497
How does that marrow test go?

FIRST DOCTOR T497
This test?

PATIENT T497
Do they get marrow from your bones?

FIRST DOCTOR T497
Yeah no, no.  It's not painful.  They just scan you.  It's like a scanner test.

PATIENT T497
That's for the marrow?

FIRST DOCTOR T497
For your bone marrow?

PATIENT T497
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR T497
When did they do that?

PATIENT T497
I thought you said @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR T497
No I'm gonna check a bone density test.  That's not the marrow test where they use a needle to go in your bones and take out marrow.  This is not like that.  This is just like a CT scan that you had before, but it's done a little differently, it's like the strength of your bone.

PATIENT T497
Hmm.

FIRST DOCTOR T497
To see how much calcium is in them.  Because if you don't have enough calcium, your bones are more liable to break.

PATIENT T497
Oh.
