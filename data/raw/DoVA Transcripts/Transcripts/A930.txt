DOCTOR A930
Okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
I'm his life partner.  Nice to meet you.

DOCTOR A930
Hi, alright so I was pretty sure you’re new but I think it's always a good idea when people bring other people with them to appointments.

SECOND PERSON A930
I just don't let him go anywhere by himself.

DOCTOR A930
That way she can tattle on you.

SECOND PERSON A930
(Laughter).

DOCTOR A930
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A930
No this way he can't lie to me.

DOCTOR A930
So let's see.  How have you been doing?

Oh fairly well I guess.

DOCTOR A930
Did you tell the hospital, not just.

PATIENT A930

DOCTOR A930
For 12 hours.  Was it a good stay for 12 hours?

PATIENT A930
Not really.

DOCTOR A930

PATIENT A930
Nothing.
 
DOCTOR A930
Nothing?  Alright.

SECOND PERSON A930

DOCTOR A930
And what are they planning on doing?

PATIENT A930
Well they want to go in on the new module.

SECOND PERSON A930
Nodule.

PATIENT A930
That they found, they want to go in and take a biopsy of it I guess.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.  So that’s a little nerve-wracking, huh?

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A930
Yes I may lose @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
One, two day procedure could be a five to seven day depending on what gets found out and stuff.
 
DOCTOR A930
Oh you mean how long he's going to be in the hospital and what not.

SECOND PERSON A930
Right.  I have a question so when he was in, about two weeks ago he came in for a um Urology consult.

DOCTOR A930
Yes.

SECOND PERSON A930
And they were going to take; well they did take a sample of the urine and everything.  Did anything come back with that, I mean anything abnormal or?

PATIENT A930
Well they were supposed to send it off because it came through the @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Right I know that's why I'm wondering if they found anything.

DOCTOR A930
Well I don't see any urine in here.  I don't see it.  Let me read their notes.  Cause you just saw them on the 10th.

SECOND PERSON A930
Correct.

DOCTOR A930
@@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Don't do that @@@.

DOCTOR A930
This is not good for me.  Um oh okay, so they did a cystoscopy it looks like.  That's how @@@ Cytology so I'll check that.  There we go.  So it says um there are some cell abnormalities um and rare atypical cells and some regular just plain cells suggestive of a type of virus.  It doesn't say anything specifically about any sort of cancer.

SECOND PERSON A930
Hmm.

DOCTOR A930
I don't think it's a completely normal result.

SECOND PERSON A930
Right.

DOCTOR A930
But I'm not a urologist, I don't know exactly.

SECOND PERSON A930
Well I know they've got a follow-up, I think it's March 5th or something for him to go back again so.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
I was just wondering you know what they'd found or.

DOCTOR A930
Yeah definitely they did not see any positive for malignancy there so.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
What other questions?

PATIENT A930
Huh question.

DOCTOR A930
You can put that on the table if you want to if that makes it easier.  So uh you have Cardiology to get clearance today.

SECOND PERSON A930
Hmm.

DOCTOR A930
When are your test going to be?

PATIENT A930
I have no idea.
 
DOCTOR A930
You haven't had it scheduled yet?

PATIENT A930
No.

SECOND PERSON A930
They're waiting until all the @@@ on this.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.

PATIENT A930
Just out of curiosity um I had a form and somebody sent a form in for diabetic shoes but somebody said that I haven't been in here for two years and I have to come in you know before they can sign it.

DOCTOR A930
@@@.

PATIENT A930
And I was seen every three months ago.

DOCTOR A930
@@@.

PATIENT A930
Somebody said that I haven't been here in two years and I just kind of wonder where they got that information now.
 
DOCTOR A930
You know what I think it is is that you haven't been to see a primary care doctor in quite some time.

SECOND PERSON A930
Right.

PATIENT A930
I don't think I've ever seen a primary care doctor that I know of.

DOCTOR A930
Well.

SECOND PERSON A930
@@@ DOCTOR either moved on or.

PATIENT A930
Oh I'm not sure they were primary doctors.

DOCTOR A930
The last time I saw you was in June.  You were supposed to be patient of @@@ DOCTOR but I believe that I had seen you once before because you were, yeah cause I covered her clinics when she was on maternity leave.  Since I have, at this point, seen you twice and she had never seen you, I just kind of put you in my clinic cause there really was no point in you establishing with her again.  Especially since her residents @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Right.

DOCTOR A930
So that's what it comes down to.  Um so they said that you had to come in and be seen for that paperwork right?

PATIENT A930
Yeah um.
 
DOCTOR A930
Alright, @@@ I’ll tell them I’m seeing  you.  @@@ for some reason did not have you fully established.

SECOND PERSON A930
Right.

DOCTOR A930
@@@.

PATIENT A930
Nobody has seen me huh?

DOCTOR A930
No they didn't.

SECOND PERSON A930
I want you, dear.

PATIENT A930
You have to.

DOCTOR A930
You’ve been following up with Onc. @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Cause it's just never been one particular.

DOCTOR A930
Right, no that's fine.

SECOND PERSON A930
Like you know if we had a question or something there's never been anybody who we could really call because they say well who's your doctor and it's like okay we don't know.

PATIENT A930
What time of a day is yeah.

DOCTOR A930
So I’m trying to find where they had this message is from. They sent me a message. @@@ hidden behind things.  Do you have that paperwork with you on the shoes with you?

PATIENT A930
What paperwork do you need?

DOCTOR A930
For the diabetic shoes.

SECOND PERSON A930
No.

PATIENT A930
No.

SECOND PERSON A930
That's one piece of paper I didn't bring with.

PATIENT A930
Well that's got nothing to do with the VA though that's medicaid.

DOCTOR A930
Let me see if at home I have it in my files because when you had the first visit and then you haven't seen somebody in a while they probably wanted him checked.

SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah for the neuropathy and all that.
 
DOCTOR A930
Sure now what do you need, do you need to get a prescription?

PATIENT A930
Uh, I guess we need permission to get the shoes uh.

SECOND PERSON A930
But what do you @@@.

PATIENT A930
I got some medical supplier @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Oh for your medical supplier?

DOCTOR A930
Okay so you need @@@.

PATIENT A930
It's got nothing to do with you know the VA.

DOCTOR A930
The VA okay.

PATIENT A930
But they asked who the primary doctor I saw and that's where they got the VA.

DOCTOR A930
And they asked where your primary doctor was okay.

PATIENT A930
Yeah.
 
DOCTOR A930
So let me look through there um and I can reach you at PHONE NUMBER?

PATIENT A930
Most of the time.

DOCTOR A930
Okay even if you just have a number for the supplier, I could maybe just call them and have them fax it to me.

SECOND PERSON A930
I think we've got it at home, that I do know.

PATIENT A930
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A930
The regular number.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.

PATIENT A930
Yeah cause I think I told you @@@.

DOCTOR A930
@@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah.

PATIENT A930
Alright.
 
DOCTOR A930
Um okay so we want in because you were having this weight loss and I think we need to kind of get him then followed um.

PATIENT A930
Yeah.

DOCTOR A930
You’ve actually gained some weight it looks like @@@.

PATIENT A930
No I don't think so.

DOCTOR A930
Oh.

PATIENT A930
Yeah I go by weight at home without you know clothes or anything like that, that adds about 15 pounds.

DOCTOR A930
So this is your weight trend over the last two years.  So you were about 158 in February 2009 then it went down and then it came back up and then it’s been relatively steady and he is actually up to about 150 now.  That's you know with our scale.

PATIENT A930
Well I @@@ weighed me fully clothed.
 
DOCTOR A930
Yeah and you should be in theory fully-clothed every time you take your weight here so.

PATIENT A930
Okay but that's you know.

DOCTOR A930
We're going to follow your trends here.  I'm not saying that that's not concerning.  I think if you think you’re losing weight and um and with the lung nodules we should follow up on this @@@.

PATIENT A930
Well we saw the nutritionist @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
And anyhow she gave us all sorts of ideas for.

DOCTOR A930
Good.

SECOND PERSON A930
You know shakes and smoothies and things that you know.

DOCTOR A930
To gain weight.

SECOND PERSON A930
And things that you know.  His biggest thing is, you know you can have anything in front of you but if you are not hungry, you can't force yourself to eat, I don't care you know, I wish that was my problem but it's not.

DOCTOR A930
Me too.

SECOND PERSON A930
But um you know and I mean she gave us some really good ideas and you know peanut butter and graham crackers and you know on the one hand the things could definitely put the weight on him but then on the other hand.

PATIENT A930
Being diabetic it's kind of hard.

SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah you know so it's, it is hard to balance it out.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
Kind of like I said its one thing if you are hungry, but he just has I mean no appetite.

PATIENT A930
I don't think there's a magic pill to cure that.

SECOND PERSON A930
And maybe there's not, I have to tell people that.  Because when I say he has no appetite they look at me like.

DOCTOR A930
Are you serious?

SECOND PERSON A930
Yes I am.

PATIENT A930
Try McDonald’s, yeah.

DOCTOR A930
@@@.  I don't expect him to be the @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Thank you.

DOCTOR A930
So um.

SECOND PERSON A930
We have a 7 pound Yorkshire terrier, Yorkie at home that I swear eats more than he does.  Right?

PATIENT A930
Yeah.  Yes he does.

DOCTOR A930
Yeah.  I have a little yippy dog, I have a 7 pound um Maltese.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay I know what they look like.

DOCTOR A930
Pretty little @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah but you know you can't live with them but you can't live without them either.

DOCTOR A930
Yeah I know.

PATIENT A930
Well we’re going to try, if he doesn’t change.
 
DOCTOR A930
I know, I’m obsessed with him.  Alright so um are you having any chest pain with walking around?

PATIENT A930
No.

DOCTOR A930
About how far do you think you can walk?

PATIENT A930
Oh eight or nine steps most of the time uh I have no qualms about.  I haven't taking 20 mile hikes or anything you know but I'm.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
He gets lightheaded and dizzy if he gets up real fast um.  The pain when it was up here where, which I guess is where the nodule is or whatever.  It's still there, I can tell just by you know him putting his hand up there or whatever the case may be but um, to walk for any great length or anything like that uh uh.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
So @@@ stuff like that.

DOCTOR A930
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT A930
The pain?

SECOND PERSON A930
@@@ depends.

DOCTOR A930
Not being able to walk, seven steps is not very far.

PATIENT A930
No I was joking.

DOCTOR A930
You can walk here from the parking lot is that correct?

PATIENT A930
Oh yeah.

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh you know I think the combination also is part of the diabetes because of the numbness.

DOCTOR A930
And tingling in the feet?

SECOND PERSON A930
And tingling in the feet and legs yeah.
 
DOCTOR A930
When did you last see podiatry.

PATIENT A930
Oh I had, they cut the toenail off at that time.

SECOND PERSON A930
That was last year.

PATIENT A930
I dropped something two years.

SECOND PERSON A930
Two years ago.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.  So we need to get you back in the Podiatry Clinic. These are the things that can wait until after the whole lung nodule thing, but I don't want you to @@@ your diabetes um just because of that.  Um so I think a good thing to do would be to do - because your hemoglobin A1c was 8.8 @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Is that good, bad or indifferent?

DOCTOR A930
In June. It's not good.

PATIENT A930
@@@.

DOCTOR A930
No it needs to be higher than that, I mean lower.

PATIENT A930
Lower, thank you.
 
DOCTOR A930
Um but your blood sugars look okay, they're not terrible.

SECOND PERSON A930
No but I have a question for you on that one.

DOCTOR A930
Sure.

SECOND PERSON A930
You know I @@@ on the one hand with the eating and so on and forth okay and like the nutritionist was saying that you know yes we know diabetes is the concern but you know you also need to you know eat to keep your energy up and so on and so forth but his blood sugar lately cause he takes it every day okay.

DOCTOR A930
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON A930
He takes it in the morning and everything, it can range anywhere from let's say one day well you know 135-140 and it can go up to closes to 300.

DOCTOR A930
What's it in the morning?

SECOND PERSON A930
He only takes it once a day and it's in the morning.

DOCTOR A930
Okay and it varies that much huh?

SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah.

PATIENT A930
Uh it depends you know if I have a late night snack you know before I go to bed it's going to be higher the next morning.

DOCTOR A930
What's your dose of Glargine at night?

PATIENT A930
30, 30 units.  So I think I got 28 but one doctor told me to go up to 30.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.

PATIENT A930
That's what I've been taking.

DOCTOR A930
When did you go up to 30?

PATIENT A930
Oh about uh three months ago maybe.
 
DOCTOR A930
Do you take it with meals or just take it that one time a day?

PATIENT A930
Just one time a day.

DOCTOR A930
So I think we need to get you in to see the Pharm D to help manage your blood sugars because managing your blood sugars before you get the surgery is going to be important okay.

PATIENT A930
Uh I am wondering if I should go back to the, I'm on the slow-acting once a day insulin.

DOCTOR A930
Yeah.

PATIENT A930
So you can't really change it during the day.

DOCTOR A930
You can add to it, Lispro.

SECOND PERSON A930
Lispro?

DOCTOR A930
Lispro it's a short-acting insulin and that's usually what we do is recommend a long-acting as kind of a baseline.

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A930
And then the short-acting to be used with meals.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

PATIENT A930
Well I was led to believe that you couldn't mix the two.

DOCTOR A930
No you can.  Yeah there are two different types.

SECOND PERSON A930
I like that becuase I know sometimes it does depend on if he ate late you know the evening before or if he gets up in the morning and has a cookie or something.

DOCTOR A930
Do you ever feel a little shaky at night or shaky with low blood sugar?

PATIENT A930
I have once or twice, twice but I try to alleviate that by I guess cause one time I passed out.

DOCTOR A930
Were you having any chest pain?

PATIENT A930
No.
 
DOCTOR A930
We probably should repeat your hemoglobin A1c today just to see what it is um the rest of your labs are really quite normal and then the only other thing is that I want to check um.

SECOND PERSON A930
Do they have lab draws for brain function?

DOCTOR A930
We don't.

PATIENT A930
@@@.

DOCTOR A930
B-12.

SECOND PERSON A930
I had to throw that in there sorry.

PATIENT A930
After that behave.

DOCTOR A930
Now have you eaten this morning?

PATIENT A930
No.

DOCTOR A930
No.

PATIENT A930
No.

SECOND PERSON A930
Cup of coffee.
 
DOCTOR A930
Alright then.

PATIENT A930
At 6:30 in the morning I'm not hungry.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.  And then how has your blood pressure been?

PATIENT A930
Uh not bad.

DOCTOR A930
Okay so you're taking the aspirin, the gabapentin, the insulin and everything we said.

PATIENT A930
Uh I just started taking aspirin again.

DOCTOR A930
Well they may tell you to stop that relatively soon for the surgery.  Lisinopril 40 daily right?

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A930
Simvastatin okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
My voice is going out on me.  Simvastatin is that a derivative of Lipitor or?

DOCTOR A930
Yeah it's the same.

SECOND PERSON A930
Is it?  Okay.

DOCTOR A930
Same kind.  Alright so I think we need some labs today just to check your lipids.

PATIENT A930
As long it don't involve needles with that.

DOCTOR A930
There's no way to give blood without a needle.

PATIENT A930
Bite my lip.

DOCTOR A930
@@@ that might take longer and be more painful.  Um I know and then I wonder if we need to have you do some more diabetes education.  Do you know that you should be checking your blood sugars more often?

PATIENT A930
Well I was lead to believe that @@@ that I've been using for about a year now.
 
DOCTOR A930
Yeah.

PATIENT A930
But there's not, again I was under the impression you couldn't take any supplemental.

DOCTOR A930
Right but you can check it different times and you can add @@@ to your meal.  It sounds like you probably could go up on the Glargine even more.  So let's see what your hemoglobin A1c shows since it's been a while since you've had that.

PATIENT A930
Yeah, it's supposed to be what around 4 or 5.

DOCTOR A930
Your hemoglobin A1c?

PATIENT A930
Yeah.

DOCTOR A930
Between 6 and 7.

PATIENT A930
Oh I thought it was.
 
DOCTOR A930
Your hemoglobin A1c it's not terrible but it's not good.  So that could be better and the reason why I'm so concerned about it now is because I want it to be as good as possible prior to your surgery.

SECOND PERSON A930
Right.

DOCTOR A930
Because how well your diabetes is controlled with @@@ on how long you heal.  And diabetics already have a hard time healing from surgery.

SECOND PERSON A930
Right.

PATIENT A930
So yeah.

DOCTOR A930
Yeah.

PATIENT A930
And they know that I'm allergic to needles.

DOCTOR A930
Um @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Well we only @@@.

DOCTOR A930
Yeah.

PATIENT A930
@@@.  I think you missed that.

SECOND PERSON A930
@@@.  I'm going to give that to you but that's not @@@.

DOCTOR A930
@@@.

PATIENT A930
We're not going back there now.

SECOND PERSON A930
Oh I'm sorry.
 
DOCTOR A930
Take a deep breath in and out.  Breathe normal.  Where is your pain?

PATIENT A930
Uh if I have it's right underneath the ribs.

DOCTOR A930
Is it reproducible when you push there?

PATIENT A930
No.

DOCTOR A930
No it's inside.

PATIENT A930
Yeah.

DOCTOR A930
No you feel that it's inside, it doesn't hurt when I push or anything?

PATIENT A930
No, no.
 
DOCTOR A930
Okay.  Alright.  Well it sounds like everything that needs to be  managed right now is, I would probably recommend that we get a Pharm D to help manage and titrate your meds.

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A930
Because once we are able to get the under control then we can kind of continue you know care.  But they are very good at kind of adding things on.

PATIENT A930
She used to call about once a month and I haven't heard from her.

DOCTOR A930
You used to talk to the Pharm D?

SECOND PERSON A930
Yes they'd call him.

PATIENT A930
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A930
Once every two months, @@@.  And that was more kind of how you doing um.

PATIENT A930
Yeah I got @@@ up in the @@@ but I haven't heard from her @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
No it was a long time ago.

DOCTOR A930
Now I don't see you for the visits, not even phone.

PATIENT A930
Yeah she used to call um I would say every six weeks or so.

SECOND PERSON A930
@@@ three, four times @@@.

PATIENT A930
Quite a while since she's called.  I had forgotten all about that.

SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah once she said @@@.  

DOCTOR A930
Yeah.  Okay, a consult was put in in 2008.  Why don't you @@@ cause I don't know if you need a new consult.  Do you know their phone number?

SECOND PERSON A930
The @@@?

DOCTOR A930
Yeah the pharmacist?

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A930
Why don't you go ahead and give them a call.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
And get re-established with them.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
8.8 really isn't good enough.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
You know.

SECOND PERSON A930
And that's something you don't @@@.

DOCTOR A930
Um the, it's called the hemoglobin A1c is what we follow and it's basically like a report card of your blood sugar control for the last three months.

SECOND PERSON A930
@@@.

DOCTOR A930
Sure.

SECOND PERSON A930
And that's what we want to tell her when we call.

DOCTOR A930
Yeah.  I mean we're going to repeat it today and I'll titrate it up but I think it's going to be especially important because he's going to have surgery.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
Just have her.

SECOND PERSON A930
Hemoglobin A, what is it.

PATIENT A930
@@@ A1-C?
 
DOCTOR A930
I'm sorry what?

SECOND PERSON A930
Hemoglobin A.

DOCTOR A930
A1c.

SECOND PERSON A930
I'm sorry.

DOCTOR A930
No that's okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay no that's okay.

DOCTOR A930

SECOND PERSON A930

DOCTOR A930
Yeah I wish I could, that would be nice.

SECOND PERSON A930
@@@ nice.

DOCTOR A930
I'll be right back okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
You know let me look at their last note cause I don't know.  I don't want to get so caught up in not being your health maintenance doctor because of the more active issues.  Yeah we're going to do um, uh let's see.  You had a colonoscopy in 2009 which was fine.

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh yes.

DOCTOR A930
You had the pneumo vaccination in 2003, tetanus done in 2002  and then um and have you ever smoked?

PATIENT A930
Oh 12 or 13 years ago.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.  So you had a CT scan and that would have told us @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A930
Okay so no aneurysms, so pretty much your screening is up-to-date alright.

PATIENT A930
You don't @@@ that do you?

DOCTOR A930
No.  You're in the hospital system, there's nothing we can do about it.

SECOND PERSON A930
You can run but you can't hide.

DOCTOR A930

SECOND PERSON A930

(DOCTOR OUT:  92:45  DOCTOR IN:  102:20)

DOCTOR A930

PATIENT A930

DOCTOR A930
Um okay, so I'm going to put in for another Pharm D consult just to see, just in case you need a new one.

PATIENT A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930

PATIENT A930
Uh yeah I see him again February 3rd I think.

DOCTOR A930
Okay so you need to see Ophtho um, Podiatry you need to make a call to them okay and then you should probably call and make another appointment with the Hemoc Clinic too.  

PATIENT A930
And what's that about?

DOCTOR A930
The Cancer Clinic, just because of the lung nodules, I think you have.

PATIENT A930
Yeah that was the whole reason.  There was one before when I had the original cancer 12 years ago.
 
DOCTOR A930
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A930
But now another one's developed and that's the one they wanted to test to see if it is cancer.

DOCTOR A930
Yeah I just think that you probably should you know.

PATIENT A930
Well I just can't see being in the hospital for five days for that but.

DOCTOR A930
Oh no seen in the clinic.

PATIENT A930
Oh.

DOCTOR A930
Just make an appointment.  You get your meds mailed to you right?

PATIENT A930
Yeah.
 
DOCTOR A930
Okay.  So I'm going to change your Glargine to 32 units okay.

PATIENT A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
Um let's see what else do we need to refill for you?

PATIENT A930
Um I don't know.  Unfortunately I've gotten lazy and the wife takes care of that.

DOCTOR A930
I'll just look.  I just don't want things to expire on you, you know.  Are you still taking the terazosin?  Come in.

SECOND PERSON A930
It's just me.

DOCTOR A930
Are you still taking your terazosin?

PATIENT A930
Am I taking whatever she said?

DOCTOR A930
Um you know what I'll just get a refill for you.  Simvastatin, @@@. I think everything else you have @@@ So I won't worry about that.  Do you take a docusate every day the stool softener?

PATIENT A930
Yeah, no.
 
DOCTOR A930
Then I won’t worry about it.

PATIENT A930
I don't think I need @@@ just the opposite.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.

PATIENT A930
@@@.

DOCTOR A930
Um @@@ get labs done, if you have time to get them done before your appointment.

SECOND PERSON A930
When does it open the Lab?

PATIENT A930
The Lab?

DOCTOR A930
Um you could go down on the first floor or see if they're still around up here.  I think they head out a little bit earlier because it's uh.

PATIENT A930
Lunchtime.
 
DOCTOR A930
Yeah and then yeah how's your peripheral neuropathy?

SECOND PERSON A930
Lousy.

PATIENT A930
Yeah.

DOCTOR A930
He can go up on the gabapentin, you're not on the max dose, so do you want to try that?

SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah.

DOCTOR A930
You can answer for him, that's fine.

SECOND PERSON A930
He looks at me, like neuropathy, what is that?

DOCTOR A930
No yeah @@@.

PATIENT A930
I don't mind it in the feet and legs, @@@ headache.

DOCTOR A930
You know how you're taking the 300 tablets?

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A930
I changed it to three every eight hours instead of two every eight hours.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
So it should come to you in the mail but the stuff you have at home you can do that.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay so three instead of two okay.

DOCTOR A930
Three yes.  So the maximum dose is actually four.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
Every three hours or every eight hours now sometimes when you go up it can make you feel a little bit more like I don't know tired.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
Things like that.

PATIENT A930
That's what I need.

SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah.

DOCTOR A930
So just watch it um.  That's why I'm not going up to 1200 three times a day, just going up by one.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
And if this isn't helping we'll try going up by more.  Your kidney function is normal.

SECOND PERSON A930
Right.

DOCTOR A930
So there's no reason why you can't.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
Go to four.

PATIENT A930
Okay.
 
DOCTOR A930
Alright.  So Glargine up to 32 units.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
Gabapentin up to three pills three times a day.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
And I put in the Pharm D consult again.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
Just in case um.  You should follow up with Oncology at some point just you know.  I know you already know them through DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON A930
Yeah.

DOCTOR A930
But um I think you might get a different oncologist because you DOCTOR at all?

SECOND PERSON A930
@@@.

DOCTOR A930
She's one of the main lung doctors here.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
The lung cancer doctors.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
I mean, this is all pending what they.

SECOND PERSON A930
Sure.

DOCTOR A930
But you she'll want you to still get something with them.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930
And then follow up with Podiatry okay?

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A930
Cause you mentioned a supplemental insulin that I could take.

DOCTOR A930
I think we can start with the Glargine first.

PATIENT A930
Go up to 32?
 
DOCTOR A930
You know since your morning sugars are good and then if we need to then we can add on the other one.  So.

SECOND PERSON A930
So go up to 32 on the insulin.

DOCTOR A930
Let's assume the control there and then if you start having, but that means to start checking your blood sugars more times during the day, at least one other time, to kind of get an idea of where your sugars are going during the day to see if you need that extra insulin okay.

PATIENT A930
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A930
Cause I don't know if you need it.

SECOND PERSON A930
@@@.

DOCTOR A930
So I think we could just get it under control with the Glargine.

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A930
But if we can't then we can always add it on.

PATIENT A930
If she'd take all the cakes and pies out of the house I wouldn't need it.

DOCTOR A930
But it doesn't sound like a very fun house okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
No none.

DOCTOR A930
Um and is there a reason why you're not on a beta blocker that you know of?  By that I mean anything like metoprolol, carvedilol.

PATIENT A930
I was.

SECOND PERSON A930
He was on the metoprolol, yeah that one.

DOCTOR A930
Okay.

SECOND PERSON A930
He was on it once and then they didn't refill it or took him off, I don't remember what it was.

DOCTOR A930
They may want to restart that but I'll let Cardiology discuss that with you because it can be cardio protective to the heart.

SECOND PERSON A930
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A930
It's um prior to surgery post and prior.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay. 

DOCTOR A930
So they may decide to give you that and your heart rate will tolerate it so I don't see any reason not to.  Otherwise you're on everything else that you should be on okay.

PATIENT A930
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A930
Any questions?

PATIENT A930
We want to get out of here, yeah no.
 
DOCTOR A930
Antsy, antsy, antsy.  Let me look across @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
@@@.

PATIENT A930
Now now.

DOCTOR A930
I asked @@@ it's not my lucky day @@@.

SECOND PERSON A930
She sounds good to me.

DOCTOR A930
Yeah. So you need to go downstairs, on the first floor.

SECOND PERSON A930
@@@

PATIENT A930
We want the labs, 135, 134, something like that.

DOCTOR A930
Yeah, @@@ near the elevator yeah.

SECOND PERSON A930
No okay.

DOCTOR A930
So go ahead and check out.  @@@ like to see you in three months to kind of follow up on all of these things I have no control over but just keep checking them.

PATIENT A930
Okay.

DOCTOR A930

SECOND PERSON A930
We'll do that.

PATIENT A930
Okay, thank you, thank you.

DOCTOR A930
No problem and um I'll give you a call about if I can't find that paperwork.

SECOND PERSON A930
Okay and then I'll look for it.

PATIENT A930
You too.

DOCTOR A930
If you can get me the number, I can give them the fax number for here @@@.

PATIENT A930
Yeah.
 
DOCTOR A930
Okay, alright.

SECOND PERSON A930
Thanks doctor very much.

PATIENT A930

DOCTOR A930
