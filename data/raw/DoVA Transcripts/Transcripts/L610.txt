DOCTOR L610

DOCTOR L610
Thank you, thank you.  So.

PATIENT L610
So I'm gonna have to follow you in California.

DOCTOR L610
You know you're more than welcome too.

PATIENT L610
You don't know me; I really will come to California okay.

DOCTOR L610
Let me finish filling out a couple of things here from my last patient and then we'll get talking.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
There are a couple of things that um we ordered for you so.

PATIENT L610
Yeah I haven't seen him for six months.

DOCTOR L610
Yeah he hadn't seen you in a while and now he's moving on I guess so okay, he's actually moving to St. Louis.

PATIENT L610
Hmm.

DOCTOR L610
I know I, okay.  I'm sorry I didn't recognize you initially.

PATIENT L610
Okay.  Its okay, hey I know you go through a lot of people.  Now there's another doctor here.  His name is oh God what did they say his name was DOCTOR something.

DOCTOR L610
DOCTOR?

PATIENT L610
DOCTOR right okay.  If you drop me, would you make sure I get him?

DOCTOR L610
Okay you probably won't.  Well he's my boss in this clinic.

PATIENT L610
Fantastic.  I’m tired of going through this you know.

DOCTOR L610
I guess it's finally making me do this, okay so what can I help you with today?

PATIENT L610
Okay.  I just came from Urology okay.

DOCTOR L610
Yeah.

PATIENT L610
She said that I need to talk to you.

DOCTOR L610
About?

PATIENT L610
I still have this congestion going on here.  Now I think I indicated to you the last time that I hadn't had this congestion until the pulled all my teeth out and one was really rough pulling that tooth out.  Uh did not give me the proper injection cause I felt it, I mean I was really in pain and I told them about that.  So now I have this constant drain.  I told you about that last time and you gave me something for it.

DOCTOR L610
Yeah, let's see what I gave you um.  What did I just give you; oh you were on Zyrtec before right, that's not new.

PATIENT L610
What's the Zyrtec for?

DOCTOR L610
Allergies and postnasal drip.

PATIENT L610
Oh okay, I think that's one of the ones I got mixed up, so start taking the Zyrtec.

DOCTOR L610
The Zyrtec.  Well I increased your blood pressure medicine last time.

PATIENT L610
Right.

DOCTOR L610
Remember you have high blood pressure.

PATIENT L610
That one too.

DOCTOR L610
Okay.

PATIENT L610
And I'd like to get that blood pressure without adding another.

DOCTOR L610
Okay, eventually.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Do you have a low salt diet?

PATIENT L610
Oh, I'll go to the low salt diet, whatever you tell me to do, I'm gonna do.

DOCTOR L610
Low salt diet.

PATIENT L610
Okay.  Cause I'm in my 60s okay.  I got a 12-year-old so I want another 60 years.

DOCTOR L610
You don't look 61 okay.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
You can very well live longer.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Um the one thing though, you brought it up, I'm glad I see this now is um, oh okay I'll talk about that in a second.  Low salt diet.

PATIENT L610
You got it.

DOCTOR L610
Okay and no fried foods, once a week great you know.  

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Anything more than that, probably not a good idea.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
That's the best thing to do okay.  Okay so that's that.  Um you have high calcium okay.

PATIENT L610
Right.

DOCTOR L610
And people wonder what does that mean, well it can make you feel, it can sometimes present some of the symptoms of fatigue, feeling.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
Kind of blah.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
They call it moans, stones and groans I think are the three things that's kind of alarming.

PATIENT L610
Hmm.

DOCTOR L610
Because you've got muscle aches and pains.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
Cramps.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
Fatigue and then kidney stones.

PATIENT L610
I had them oh how, oh God that was horrible.

DOCTOR L610
So then you ask why do you have high calcium levels.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
Well it very well could be parathyroid.

PATIENT L610
Parathyroid, that's what they told me when they last seen me okay.

DOCTOR L610
So we need to check the um.

PATIENT L610
Calcium?

DOCTOR L610
Well we need to check the calcium and the urine.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
And I think he ordered that, did he or did you want me to order it.

PATIENT L610
He said that he was gonna order it, I went down and never received the bottle cause he wanted me to urinate in the bottle for 24 hours and then send it to the lab.

DOCTOR L610
Unfortunately that's the process.

PATIENT L610
Okay.  If you put in the consult I'll come back out on Monday and pick the bottle up. 

DOCTOR L610
I already ordered that so that's done okay.  Um and I think we need to take a look at this too.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Um, it would probably be better to get the labs first and then we can maybe take a look at this stuff.  Um so there's a couple, here's the thing.  So what do you do about that oral surgery, if this is significant.  If these labs are concerning enough.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
And you are sent to Navocate, sounds like.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
So I think this would qualify for surgery but I want to see the labs first.

PATIENT L610
Okay.  My understanding was they were going to try me on medicine first.

DOCTOR L610
We could try the medicine first.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
But let me see what the labs look like.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Because if it's really from the parathyroid you could do medicine but the gold standards of care is to remove them.

PATIENT L610
I don't like removing stuff.  I want to leave out of here with everything I came in with.

DOCTOR L610
Well let me see.

PATIENT L610
If we can get around it that's cool, if we can't then I’m not going to be a problem.

DOCTOR L610
Now how's your breathing?

PATIENT L610
That's what I have a problem with, especially during intercourse.  I mean I get shortness of breath.

DOCTOR L610
During intercourse you say?

PATIENT L610
Yes.

DOCTOR L610
Okay.

PATIENT L610
Or anytime I stress myself.  I used to walk quite a bit, I can't do that anymore.  I used to be able to run; I can't do that at all.

DOCTOR L610
And we never got a stress test on you did we?

PATIENT L610
A long time ago.  It's just like I inhale and it's like its tight right in here.  Feels like it's congestion up in here uh when I'm exerting myself even modestly okay and that's what concerned me so is it from the nasal drip, is it from my smoking from 30 years, I mean what kind of.  And they took x-rays, did that help them?

DOCTOR L610
Not really.  So, that was - not very long.

PATIENT L610
So they took, checked an x-ray but they took it times four and they said it was all behind in my heart, they didn't get a good shot at so they wanted to give me.

DOCTOR L610
Yeah which is very possible so.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
@@@ 

PATIENT L610
It could be the what?

DOCTOR L610
It could be @@@.

PATIENT L610
Alright.

DOCTOR L610
So it's hard to say um.  He wants a repeat chest x-ray.

PATIENT L610
How often can I get these things?

DOCTOR L610
Well okay, you're just starting.  I mean we want to see your lungs okay.  I know you smoked for a while.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.  I haven't smoked in over 11-12 years.

DOCTOR L610
Okay but how many years did you smoke for?

PATIENT L610
Well probably a good part of 30, 25-30.

DOCTOR L610
That's a long time.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
Even if you quit um.  There was no obvious thing on the x-ray that was concerning okay.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Um and you had normal lung function tests.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Recently.

PATIENT L610
So have not found any ill-effect from the smoking?

DOCTOR L610
No there's no emphysema.

PATIENT L610
Okay, whew.

DOCTOR L610
No it was completely normal, that's @@@@ a year ago.

PATIENT L610
Okay, so whatever this congestion is something else.

DOCTOR L610
It's something else. Um is it the heart, maybe okay.  Your echo that I ordered for you before is completely normal.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Okay.  Um it was a little bit limited because I think the person who performed the test was not very skilled.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
So cause you know you deal with very obese people, it's hard to see the heart and you're right @@@ very obese.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
So I might recommend a stress test actually.

PATIENT L610
Let's do it.

DOCTOR L610
Okay.

PATIENT L610
Here's another thing, it may be a minor concern or not.

DOCTOR L610
Oh actually you had it in July actually oh a year ago, it was normal.  Cause I thought you had one.  Didn’t you have one?

PATIENT L610
Yeah, describe what a stress test is?

DOCTOR L610
You can do it any yeah, either they inject something into and you feel sick or they put you on a treadmill and make you walk.

PATIENT L610
That is the one I did. But, here's the thing I worked out and went a long time on the treadmill.  I remember that.

DOCTOR L610
Okay.

PATIENT L610
Uh I couldn't do even a third of that now, that's what I'm saying it's different.  Uh and my legs, my legs are weak, okay I'm stumbling and tripping a whole lot.  I almost, in fact this morning, I'm walking up the stairs, six flights of stairs and it's like my knee gave out.  It's like my muscles could not, actually going on.

DOCTOR L610
Did you have any knee arthritis?

PATIENT L610
No.

DOCTOR L610
You're on medicine for it though.

PATIENT L610
Arthritis?

DOCTOR L610
Yeah meloxicam, arthritis medicine.

PATIENT L610
Meloxicam, I remember the meloxicam but I thought that was something else.  You know at some point I'm going to need somebody to write down all the medicines I got and what they for.

DOCTOR L610
Okay.  Why don’t I, I will work on that okay.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
I'm extremely.

PATIENT L610
I know.

DOCTOR L610
I'm taking care of 12 people upstairs right now, opening the new hospital so, what I can do and I'll remind myself is to send you a letter with all the medicines down and what they're used for okay.

PATIENT L610
Alright.

DOCTOR L610
And then we'll decide which ones you really use and which ones you really want.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
And which ones are worthless.

PATIENT L610
Okay cause.

DOCTOR L610
Cause trying @@@.

PATIENT L610
Exactly.  I never liked taking medicines.

DOCTOR L610
@@@.  It's nothing new.  Your blood pressure stuff.

PATIENT L610
Yeah.

DOCTOR L610
That's necessary and let's no more salt and you lose a little weight okay.

PATIENT L610
I'm working on it.  As a matter of fact, that's what I was going to say that uh.

DOCTOR L610
Yeah.

PATIENT L610
My weight came down; it's down to 114 so I lost four pounds since I last came here.

DOCTOR L610
Actually were you using the program, the Telephone Program or no or am I thinking of somebody else?

PATIENT L610
What telephone, no, no, no.

DOCTOR L610
There's a telephone, okay that's something else.  I still hear that murmur.  They didn't detect it on that echo.

PATIENT L610
That's what it is about you.  You detected that murmur.

DOCTOR L610
I still hear it.

PATIENT L610
Nobody else has detected that.

DOCTOR L610
And with that echo not showing it, maybe I'm crazy but I swear there's a.

PATIENT L610
Well let's check into it, crazy or not.

DOCTOR L610
Yeah.  Deep breath in.

PATIENT L610
(Coughs)

DOCTOR L610
Oh, okay one more time, okay.

PATIENT L610
See I been doing that.

DOCTOR L610
Deep breath.  How long has this been going on?

PATIENT L610
Been going on a while.  When I first I came here I started talking about this.

DOCTOR L610
You don't have a blood clot history in your family do you?

PATIENT L610
Hmm, you know what yes.  My mother died a year or so ago from blood clots.

DOCTOR L610
Blood clots okay.

PATIENT L610
Yeah.

DOCTOR L610
Okay where were the blood clots?

PATIENT L610
Oh God, it went from her chest to her brain or something like that.

DOCTOR L610
Okay, let me see @@@ have a seat and I want to talk to DOCTOR.  I know you like DOCTOR.

PATIENT L610
No, I never meant him. I meant you. I like you.  You're going somewhere I really want to.

DOCTOR L610
Okay.

PATIENT L610

DOCTOR L610
Hang on to that.

PATIENT L610
They have so many doctors and nurses here that.

DOCTOR L610
Alright.

PATIENT L610

DOCTOR L610
Oh.  I @@@.

PATIENT L610

DOCTOR L610
Have a seat.

(DOCTOR OUT:  20:10  DOCTOR IN:  32:50)

DOCTOR L610
Alright.  Here's what we're gonna do.  I was talking with the other doctors okay.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
About how much to get excited about this cause you've had it, actually we were looking, you've had a very extensive work-up.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
Heart, lungs, let's work on @@@.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Okay and the parathyroid and see if that helps.

PATIENT L610

DOCTOR L610
Okay and then um we'll go from there okay.  I want you to use your @@@.  You're telling me it felt like a congestion type of thing.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.  Do that para thing?

DOCTOR L610
Yeah do you have nasal symptoms too?

PATIENT L610
Yeah.

DOCTOR L610
Use this @@@, we want to something for the nose also.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Okay.  Let's try that.  So make sure you, I want to make sure you have renewals on that too.

PATIENT L610
Uh what I'm most concerned about is the breathing and the other item is the loss of muscle mass.  I mean I'm really losing muscle mass. 

DOCTOR L610
How are you @@@?  Are you lifting weights?

PATIENT L610
No I'm not doing anything.  I mean was really active about five years ago and.

DOCTOR L610
Oh okay.

PATIENT L610
And now I’m out of work, so I'm not quite as active.

DOCTOR L610
@@@ okay, so it is a one thing that they brought up.

PATIENT L610
Well.

DOCTOR L610
So part of this, because you're not such a good cardiac and there's that murmur.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
Okay.  This may not um, let's see okay.

PATIENT L610
But yeah, try to make a change on that as they're sending it to Apartment 1A and it should be 11A, A11.

DOCTOR L610
Uh you know.

PATIENT L610
I understand.  You're busy; yeah I'll have them do it out there.

DOCTOR L610

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
And we'll do all the calcium stuff too, now DOCTOR ordered that okay.  Um I'm going to; those orders should still be in effect.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
Uh let me if the orders are in.  And then I want to make sure it comes to me okay.

PATIENT L610
And the muscle pain you were saying what?

DOCTOR L610
You're deconditioned.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
You need to be doing like actually sit-ups.

PATIENT L610
Okay.

DOCTOR L610
It was interesting.  I thought it was very interesting, you know how it is interesting that this is very noticeable during intercourse.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L610
During intercourse you're using your core muscles.

PATIENT L610
Uh-huh.  So I need to work on my core.

DOCTOR L610
You've got to work on your core.

PATIENT L610
Is there someplace here I can do that?

DOCTOR L610
There is.  Have you been to the MOVE Program before?

DOCTOR L610
You know it's an exercise program.

PATIENT L610
