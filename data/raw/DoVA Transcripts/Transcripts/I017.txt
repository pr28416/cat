DOCTOR I017
We can increase it even more than that.  That's what you're supposed to do with that medicine, you're supposed to increase it until it starts helping.

PATIENT I017
Okay.

DOCTOR I017
Cause the pain you have is called, it seems like the way you describe it, the kind of the way you're describing like shooting pain.

It sounds like what we call neuropathic pain.

PATIENT I017
Right.

DOCTOR I017
And that can happen in patients with diabetes and can be perfectly controlled.

PATIENT I017
So you're saying it's all my fault?

DOCTOR I017
Nothing is your fault.  I'm just saying why it happens.  You can interpret that however you like.

PATIENT I017
Did I show you what happened to my toes?

DOCTOR I017
Nope.

PATIENT I017
Now Podiatry, Podiatry actually was doing their thing and I told them, I said my toes have been bothering me so I said, do I have gout or something, but he said no, but when he cut my toenails he did it like that everywhere but since then, the toenail has come off.

PATIENT I017
Wait a minute.  These are new glasses here. I'm not going to get me a new prescription unless they gonna pay for them.

DOCTOR I017

PATIENT I017
Yeah.

DOCTOR I017
Every day?

PATIENT I017

DOCTOR I017

PATIENT I017
The second time they thought they were gonna do biopsies but they found nothing, it was just inflamed.  Now I don't know what caused me two weeks ago and I'm scared to tell DOCTOR because last year at this time she kept me in here five days on broth.

(DOCTOR OUT:  45:14  DOCTOR IN:  52:40)

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Hi.

PATIENT I017
Hey DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Where is your sugar log?

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Told you she'd ask you.

PATIENT I017
You were supposed to tell her that, well you can.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Oh I was supposed to lie to her?  (Laughter)

PATIENT I017
No, no, not lie but just tell her so she wouldn't come, cause she jumps, she hits me.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
So really PATIENT we went over this last time and so you did not bring the log, you are taking your insulin but you don't check so how am I going to adjust those readings uh, sugar readings the insulin reading.  Okay so we'll have a pharmacist see you.  Now you are coming two times, next after January 1st, one is the Liver Clinic; one is the Nauk Clinic so one of those days you can have the nurse to see you.

PATIENT I017
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Make it on the 4th, I think I will be back by then so we can check your sugars and adjust your insulin then.

PATIENT I017
So you want me to draw the blood today or what?

SECOND DOCTOR I017
No you don't need any blood tests.  I'm talking about you checking your sugars at home the different times of the day and do you have those sheets or you want me to give you new ones?

PATIENT I017
I have those @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Okay so that we can have at least three or four readings of each column.

PATIENT I017
So you want me to do it three times a day?

SECOND DOCTOR I017
No one time a day but switch the times each day.

PATIENT I017
Oh okay.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
So uh see your glycosylated is 8.5 which is bad.  Then you have problems with your feet and so forth and your neuropathy is never going to get better if your diabetes stays like this.

PATIENT I017
But you know what DOCTOR some days they'll feel fine and then I think when the weather changes, later like at night and it seems like.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
No that's part of neuropathy and it's from your diabetes.  As long as your diabetes continues to be doing poorly it will only get worse.  Okay but if you get it controlled it may actually get better but if we don't do anything, no matter how many medicines I give you it's not going to be better.  It's linked.  If your diabetes is not controlled this is going to get worse.

PATIENT I017
And I'm trying to lose the weight cause.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Well that's good.  You do diet, you do exercise, you do your insulin, those are all the things that will control it.  Just not increasing the medicine will help you in terms of your insulin.  So you really need to do all of the things similarly but at the same time you need to check your sugar so that it @@@ you where you are and if it goes up then we can adjust your medications.

PATIENT I017
I know that.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
But in terms of Vicodin that's the other pain medication so that would not be the medicine for your diabetic neuropathy.
 
PATIENT I017
No but it helps.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
What I can do is, DOCTOR was mentioning to you that we can increase the gabapentin to 900 three times a day @@@ sleepy already.

PATIENT I017
@@@ sleepy.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Good. So it's a neuropathy medication.

PATIENT I017
That doesn’t bother me.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Okay so we'll increase that.  I can give you like 15-30 pills with no refills and this is not for the neuropathy pain.

PATIENT I017
No, no.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
It’s for the ankle pain if you need it but no refills.  I don't want to get in the habit of taking Vicodin for regular pain.

PATIENT I017
And like I told her, I still have a few pills from the last time you gave me some.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Yeah.  Then what I'm saying for, the medicine that is not for this and I don't want you to, I will issue the pain medication okay.

PATIENT I017
Alright.  So now you supposed to be going over on vacation this year.

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Next week.

PATIENT I017
Where you going?

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Nowhere.

PATIENT I017
You’re just going to relax?

SECOND DOCTOR I017
Yeah.

PATIENT I017

SECOND DOCTOR I017

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Alright @@@.  I have been trying.  I have all these records I've got to go through.

PATIENT I017

FIRST DOCTOR I017
She asked me what your blood sugar was and I said you didn't bring it.  @@@.

PATIENT I017
Now you probably said he didn't bring it, you been had, I know you telling me, setting me up.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
You know I do what I can to set you up, that's my bad.  Alright so here's what we're gonna do.

PATIENT I017
She didn't say, where, where you log at.  She always gets me.  She's been doing that since 2000, you know that.

FIRST DOCTOR I017

PATIENT I017

FIRST DOCTOR I017
She is pretty awesome.  

PATIENT I017
Well I swear by her.

FIRST DOCTOR I017

PATIENT I017
Every time I, I can call her from home, she says okay you come in to the clinic, I'll be waiting here and I go pop and I get here and she say @@@ and she treats you like a little kid just drag me down the hall and next thing I know I’m in the Emergency Room and I'm admitted to the hospital.

FIRST DOCTOR I017

PATIENT I017
Yes she does.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Alright so here's what we're gonna do.  You already have some appointments coming up. You've got on January 12th you've got your liver appointment.

PATIENT I017
I thought that was on the 4th she said.  She just said.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
The 4th is with Podiatry.

PATIENT I017
Podiatry and what else?

FIRST DOCTOR I017
The 4th you've got Podiatry and I want you to have them schedule you for a Diabetic Pharm D on January 4th as well.

PATIENT I017
Yeah to see DOCTOR.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Uh-huh.  So ask them to do that up front and bring your labs or your logs.  Um we need to reschedule your orthopedic appointment because you missed it on December 4th.

PATIENT I017
But you know what I knew there was something that I needed to do, I knew it.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
No that's okay.

PATIENT I017
But I thought I scheduled it for today because I knew I was going to be here early.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Right.  Well they can make it for you.

PATIENT I017
And they're there on Mondays and Fridays only.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Right.

PATIENT I017
So I knew it.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
You can have them reschedule that for you up front.  So we'll reschedule your Ortho appointment.

PATIENT I017
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
We'll schedule your eye doctor.

PATIENT I017
I need to reschedule with Ortho.  

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Ophthalmology for the eye doctor, Orthopedics um Diabetes with the Pharm Dy and now for your uh pain in your eye they're increasing your gabapentin to 800 mg three times a day.

PATIENT I017
I thought she said 900?

FIRST DOCTOR I017
You know you already have them and I mean you can do that way this time.  Um well I'll give you the 900 three times a day.  Um then the other thing is we want to get some imaging; basically it's called arterial blood study in your lower extremities of your legs.  Um because we're worried about some of this might arterial as well as the pain you're describing.

PATIENT I017
Arterial means?

FIRST DOCTOR I017
So your arteries are the blood vessels that take blood into the body.

PATIENT I017
That's what I'm wondering you know because right after the surgery.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I017
It was you know, just before I blacked out in surgery I remember seeing my feet go up and the way they tied the toes to hang that foot up there for them to do.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I017
I'm like.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Well what we'll do is we'll have them do that for you so that we can make sure that your arteries are doing okay.

PATIENT I017
Please.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Okay.

PATIENT I017
Thank you.  Cause I'm hurting here, I mean like here.  Okay the whole foot used to look like that.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
No, no.  Only some of the @@@ you know was due to the injury that you had and what not so let's.

PATIENT I017
And actually do a lotion, a lotion to put the sock on and it takes it right off.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I017
And we just.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Well let's get this done.

PATIENT I017
That'll be fine.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Then we'll have an explanation okay.  And I'll see you back in three months, how does that sound?

PATIENT I017
No I want to see you before.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Ha, ha, ha.

PATIENT I017
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
You can try to schedule with her if you want.

PATIENT I017
@@@ in three months I'll forget something you know.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Really.

PATIENT I017
And I figure if I.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
How early do you want @@@ you can always schedule @@@

PATIENT I017
What about, why can't we go every month and a half instead of three months?

FIRST DOCTOR I017
I mean I don't think you need to see me every month and a half.

PATIENT I017
Why?

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Because you don't have that many medical problems for you to.

PATIENT I017
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
If you want to see me every month and half.

PATIENT I017
You know what, yes I do because I want to get, I want to get cut down on insulin.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
So that's not gonna happen by you seeing me more often though.

PATIENT I017
Yes it will because I'll be bringing in my readings and you'll be telling me about those others.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Yeah but you see the thing is your labs right now that you've been getting like your A1c which shows up your um your blood sugar over what the average over a three month period is high.

PATIENT I017
Well what should that be?

FIRST DOCTOR I017
It should be less than 7.

PATIENT I017
8.5, that's nothing.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
High.

PATIENT I017
It used to be 13 or higher.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
I know its better.

PATIENT I017
So come on, you just you want jack with me (laughter).

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Well it used to be but that just mean you know we need to keep working at it.  The only way you're gonna come off of your medications is to lose more weight.

PATIENT I017
Now what medication am I taking for the diabetes?

FIRST DOCTOR I017
The insulin.  And so the only way this is gonna work is, the only way you can get your blood sugar where it's at goal is by using a log and the only way you can end up requiring less medications is to lose more weight.

PATIENT I017
I'm trying to do that but now but the reason I was saying if I come in every month and a half then I could draw some blood and I'll feel better knowing that after which I'll know where I'm at.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Well we can't check this laboratory more than every three months anyway. This lab, it gives you an average of your blood sugars for three months, for a three month period so we wouldn't check it more than every three months.  Does that make sense?  You can come and see me more often if you want I just don't think it's going to change our management of you.

PATIENT I017
I think it will.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Okay if you want to you're more than welcome to call and schedule something more often.

PATIENT I017
It's like I'm being monitored you know.  I feel more comfortable.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
If you feel more comfortable then absolutely you can come more often as you like.

PATIENT I017
I feel comfortable knowing that I'm being monitored properly and that yes I am doing the right thing.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Good.

PATIENT I017
And I'm 51; I want to see 61, 71, 81.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I017
91, I want to keep going.  I want to keep you know feeling like I'm feeling right now.  You know I want to have motivation some day.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I017
And it's not because of my diabetes; I don't know what it is.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Yeah.

PATIENT I017
Like yesterday I felt like.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Have you thought about seeing a psychiatrist?

PATIENT I017
@@@ only because, I don't think it's that bad.

FIRST DOCTOR I017

PATIENT I017

FIRST DOCTOR I017

PATIENT I017

FIRST DOCTOR I017

PATIENT I017

FIRST DOCTOR I017

PATIENT I017
I can talk to people.  I can talk to you.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
Yeah but they have a lot more.

PATIENT I017
No, no I'm more comfortable with DOCTOR.  I'll see her, if I'm in lots of pain, I'll tell her @@@ and I'll tell her.

FIRST DOCTOR I017
