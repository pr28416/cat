DOCTOR N837
PATIENT?

PATIENT N837
Yeah hi.  Hi how you doing?

DOCTOR N837
Right on time huh.

PATIENT N837
Right on time, right on the button.

DOCTOR N837
Have a seat in there.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
How you doing?

PATIENT N837
Good.

DOCTOR N837
So when was the last time I saw you, do you remember?

PATIENT N837
No I don't remember any of that.

DOCTOR N837
It's been a while?

PATIENT N837
Uh been a while yeah.  I was thinking like six months.

DOCTOR N837
Almost a year, June.

PATIENT N837
June, wow that long.

DOCTOR N837
What can I do for you?

PATIENT N837
Uh I'm in for a regular check-up I guess.

DOCTOR N837
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N837
Uh I wanted to tell you that on the pills, that last pill that I was taking, that varmazine or what it is.

DOCTOR N837
Hmm, it's call valsartan.

PATIENT N837
Valsartan, whatever that is.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.

PATIENT N837
I never could get enough of those.  I'd always run out so consequently what I did is I switched back to taking only one pill.  So I've only taken one pill instead of the pill and a half.

DOCTOR N837
Let me look @@@.  How much were you taking before?

PATIENT N837
Before I was taking one pill and then you bumped it up to a pill and a half.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.

PATIENT N837
And I took it for a while, then I couldn't get the dag gone pills and uh so I just switched back to spread them out to one pill.  But here's a listing of my blood pressures I took.

DOCTOR N837
This is on one pill.

PATIENT N837
This is all on one pill.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah there's a couple of high ones.

PATIENT N837
If you say so I'll go back to a pill and a half.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.  Cause I want it at 140 or below.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
You have a couple that uh 126, 140, so you didn't have enough huh?

PATIENT N837
Yeah, I keep running out and I am.

DOCTOR N837
How many days behind were you?  Uh how many days could you.

PATIENT N837
I think for a period there I was out of pills for about two weeks.

DOCTOR N837
Really.  If it's at 1 1/2 really.

PATIENT N837
1 1/2, so I spread it out to one pill and then I started using what I had, I went back to one pill and then since then I haven't changed it.  I just kept going with it.  @@@.  But if you're thinking the blood pressure's still too high and you want it down, I can, I got pills now but I wanted to tell you.  If they're going to get them to me, they got to give me more than what they've been sending.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.  They'll have to do that.  Cause I'm thinking you have a 90 day supply.

PATIENT N837
Yeah, if they want me on a pill and a half they're going to have to kick up the number by 50%.

DOCTOR N837
I can't do math, alright.  You need 90 pills, so 90 pills will give one pill for three months.  If you also need a half.

PATIENT N837
Yeah.

DOCTOR N837
Half a tablet for, so it would be a half tablet x3 x30.

PATIENT N837
If it would be 90 for three months then a pill and a half would be then another 45 wouldn't it?

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.  It works out to be 135 pills.  Should be enough wouldn't it?

PATIENT N837
I don't know, I been taking them uh.  I might have some left cause the problem I had is its feast or famine.  Either I have no pills or all of a sudden I got a bunch of them.  I got enough now, I got in that bottle, I think that would last me a little bit.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.

PATIENT N837
But uh how long, what I really have to be able to do is uh, when I run out, before I run out I figure about a week or so and then I turn in my prescription for that.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.

PATIENT N837
And then I get them on time.

DOCTOR N837
How active are you right now?

PATIENT N837
I'm very active.

DOCTOR N837
Are you, so do you exercise at all?

PATIENT N837
Oh yeah, every morning.

DOCTOR N837
What do you think you do?

PATIENT N837
I do about 20 minutes.  I got uh.

DOCTOR N837
Do you walk?

PATIENT N837
I walk but I got a regimen of uh exercises that I do.  They take about 25 minutes.

DOCTOR N837
What kind of exercises?

PATIENT N837
Mostly stretching.  Stretching and just limbering up.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.

PATIENT N837
And then I walk the dog, I walk her every day, about at least two, a couple of blocks. So, I’m out. But I'm active.  I'm putting brakes in the car right now.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.

PATIENT N837
And so I'm up and down you know.

DOCTOR N837
Any problems at all or anything else?  Anything that's concerning you?

PATIENT N837
Uh nothing except what I wanted to ask you.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.

PATIENT N837
When I sleep at night.

DOCTOR N837
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N837
You know I've been taking guitar lessons.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.

PATIENT N837
So when I take guitar lessons it's hard on your fingers.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.

PATIENT N837
It really hurts like hell, so anyway as I been sleeping at night, when I lay on my belly I feel tingling in my hand here.

DOCTOR N837
Hmm.

PATIENT N837
And I keep thinking that tingling is coming from pressing on the.

DOCTOR N837
@@@.  Sometimes you can injure your carpal tunnel down here.

PATIENT N837
Yeah.  I don't know but anyway.  I do, I do feel that tingling and then it goes away if I roll over and I get on my back it seems to disappear but then it'll come back again and it's like a tingling situation and I keep thinking it's coming from those fingers but I thought I'd pass it by you to see what you thought.

DOCTOR N837
Where's the tingling?

PATIENT N837
It just goes up my arm right here?

DOCTOR N837
Anywhere and do your fingers tingle at all?

PATIENT N837
Yeah.

DOCTOR N837
Which fingers?

PATIENT N837
All of them, they just.

DOCTOR N837
Any fingers worse than the others?

PATIENT N837
Yeah these are the ones that I use for the cords.

DOCTOR N837
The three here.  

PATIENT N837
You're supposed to use four for the cord but I don't use that pinky much.

DOCTOR N837
How bad is it?

PATIENT N837
No it's just very mild.

DOCTOR N837
And it goes away if you.

PATIENT N837
Yeah it goes away, yeah it isn't, it's not enough to wake you up or anything it's just a little.  It's irritating.  Like you, have you ever slept on your arm?

DOCTOR N837
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N837
You sleep on your arm and you get up and you feel a little tingling.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.

PATIENT N837
That's it.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.  How's your knee doing?

PATIENT N837
Knee is okay and I had a question on that.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.

PATIENT N837
There's a newspaper ad that says they got a new concoction a pill that lubricates the joints and it does it within a week and I didn't, I saved that article but I wanted to ask there, is there a pill on the market that is good for the joints that I might be taking?

DOCTOR N837
Well there's some controversy.  A lot of the pills for arthritis have like glucosamine or chondroitin.

PATIENT N837
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR N837
Have you tried using those in the past before?

PATIENT N837
No.

DOCTOR N837
So they have those over-the-counter.  Some studies show that it helps; some studies show that it doesn't so I can't say for sure.  It's supposed to like help lubricate your joints, help @@@.

PATIENT N837
They say take gelatin.  Is that Jell-O, is Jell-O gelatin?

DOCTOR N837
Yeah, Jell-O is a gelatin.

PATIENT N837
If you eat a lot of Jell-O would that help?

DOCTOR N837
Uh.  @@@.  Typically those have chondroitin, glucosamine and gelatin.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
And some studies show it helps, some studies show it doesn't so I can't, you know.  I don't know if it helps or not.  It can be expensive.  And @@@ bottle costs like $20-$30 for a bottle.

PATIENT N837
That kills it right there.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah and some people say it helps and some people say it doesn't.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
So I don't know if it really does @@@.

PATIENT N837
Well my, as long as I keep active and I keep my knee.  When it gets damp out.

DOCTOR N837
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N837
I've got a support that they gave me.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.

PATIENT N837
A knee support and I put that on and it's the heat from that that seems to help the most and as long as I do that I can get through day @@@.

DOCTOR N837
Do you smoke at all?

PATIENT N837
No.

DOCTOR N837
Ever smoke before?

PATIENT N837
I smoked uh when I was first in the service maybe oh, I might have been maybe about 25 years old so it's been a long time since I.  But I never smoked cigarettes.  I smoked a pipe.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.

PATIENT N837
And I smoked cigars, then cigars got too expensive.  A good cigar ran about 75 cents.

DOCTOR N837
You live pretty far from here don't you?

PATIENT N837
Yeah Arlington Heights.

DOCTOR N837
What if I want you, I need you to come back to get lab work done.  When's your next appointment here do you know?

PATIENT N837
I have no idea.  Well wait a minute I got one with uh an eye doctor.

DOCTOR N837
Do you know when that is?

PATIENT N837
Uh seemed to me that's coming up.  If you could break into that you might be able to check it.

DOCTOR N837
This doesn't list any other appointments other than @@@.

PATIENT N837
No I can't tell you because I don't remember because I complained I'm having trouble reading and they told me last time I was there in three months they were gonna have me in for cataract surgery and I never heard from them again.  So I asked them what the heck was happening and they said well you got an appointment coming up within a month or two.

DOCTOR N837
@@@.

PATIENT N837
And so I said well I'll just wait for that.

DOCTOR N837
When was the last time you saw them?

PATIENT N837
Oh God I wish you wouldn't ask me these questions.  Uh I should keep a record on that but it's been a while.

DOCTOR N837
August. (provider looked in EMR)

PATIENT N837
August, that long wow.

DOCTOR N837
You should just stopped by on your way out of here and scheduled an appointment with them.

PATIENT N837
I got one.  I don't know when it is though.

DOCTOR N837
@@@.

PATIENT N837
They told me I had one.

DOCTOR N837
It's not listed in here.  You can stop by the Eye Clinic on the way out.

PATIENT N837
I will.  They told me I had one coming up.

DOCTOR N837
And you saw the skin doctor right?

PATIENT N837
Yeah I just saw them.

DOCTOR N837
Not too long ago.

PATIENT N837
Yeah.

DOCTOR N837
And they took a biopsy alright.

PATIENT N837
Yeah they took a biopsy on my nose right and that was clear.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.

PATIENT N837
But I have trouble with my eyes cause they water a lot and I keep thinking its, they say when you're having trouble reading that's the time you should get these things removed and uh they said it wasn't the right time.

DOCTOR N837
Back in August they wanted you to come back in about 9-12 months.

PATIENT N837
Yeah.

DOCTOR N837
It should be around now from this summer.

PATIENT N837
Yeah.

DOCTOR N837
Just stop by on the way out of here.

PATIENT N837
Yeah, okay I'll double check.  If you could then we could make that appointment at the same time.

DOCTOR N837
Yep.  Just have a seat up here.  Is it a big hassle for you to come up here?

PATIENT N837
What's that?

DOCTOR N837
Is it a big hassle for you to come to the VA?

PATIENT N837
No not if it's necessary no.  I come here, but I like to double up on appointments if I can.  You know it takes me an hour to get here.

DOCTOR N837
Where did they do the biopsy?

PATIENT N837
Right there on the nose, right about there.

DOCTOR N837
The nose okay.  @@@.

PATIENT N837
They did find some stuff before.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah I saw that yeah.

PATIENT N837
And then they did uh, they did some cutting.

DOCTOR N837
Open your mouth, say ah.

PATIENT N837
Ah.

DOCTOR N837
Okay, yeah I saw their note.  Yeah they did a little bit huh.

PATIENT N837
Yeah and they were concerned because they did remove some before that was cancerous.

DOCTOR N837
Deep breath in and out.  I'll have you lie back here.  No chest pain or shortness of breath?

PATIENT N837
Nope.

DOCTOR N837
Or stomach pain?

PATIENT N837
Nope.  Those pills were uh, were uh I call them antacids.

DOCTOR N837

DOCTOR N837
Okay that's good.  Any pain at all?

PATIENT N837

DOCTOR N837
You need to sit back up here.  Who do you live with?

PATIENT N837

PATIENT N837
My wife died about 20 years ago.

DOCTOR N837
Oh wow.

PATIENT N837
So and I have @@@.  My kids are all gone.

DOCTOR N837
Things are okay at home?

PATIENT N837
Yeah.  My dog wasn't feeling too good.  I think she's got epilepsy.

DOCTOR N837
Really, that's not @@@.

PATIENT N837
I see that she fell over and she had went into like a fit.

DOCTOR N837
Yeah.

PATIENT N837
And in about three minutes it was over so I got some dog books from the library and they said yeah that breed can have epilepsy.

DOCTOR N837
@@@.

PATIENT N837
And uh I said well at 10 years old you know, maybe she's to that point where she can't.

DOCTOR N837
@@@.

PATIENT N837
Yeah she's getting pretty old.

DOCTOR N837
Let me talk to my attending I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT N837
Sure.

(DOCTOR OUT:  119:2  DOCTOR IN:  123:02)

DOCTOR N837
Alright, so we'll just change it back to the 1 1/2 I hope they send you enough this time.  They may have miscounted.

PATIENT N837
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR N837
Let me renew actually all of your regular meds have been renewed except for the valsartan.  Okay I'll renew the valsartan.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
And um.

PATIENT N837
It seemed like there was a limit on the number of valsartan I could get and I would run they would tell me that there's no more available.  Is all that heart medicine, is that all the same as rat poison?

DOCTOR N837
No why would you say that?

PATIENT N837
I heard that.  Heart medicine is usually rat poison.

DOCTOR N837
(Laughter) I don't know where you heard that um.  Okay so what we will do I'll have you come back here in about six months.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
Um unless something major goes on.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
Then you need to come back sooner than that.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
I want to check lab work, well, the thing is like, I should probably have you come back to see the nurse to make sure your blood pressure is okay.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
Okay for a nurse appointment.

PATIENT N837
Okay.  Well can you call the Eye Clinic to find out if I have an appointment that they don't show on the books?

DOCTOR N837
There's nothing in there so what you need to do is on your way down, just walk on in.

PATIENT N837
I know but then it can help you right now.

DOCTOR N837
For the.

PATIENT N837
To make another appointment.

DOCTOR N837
We'll see how your blood pressure is though.  I don't think you need to see the nurse.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
Cause you can check your blood pressure at home.

PATIENT N837
Yeah.

DOCTOR N837
So if there is any problems in your blood pressure and if it gets higher then when you take 1 1/2 a day if you see it getting any higher than 145.

PATIENT N837
Yeah.

DOCTOR N837
Call in here, let the nurse know and they'll just let me know.

PATIENT N837
I hear you.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.

PATIENT N837
Okay I'll do that.  Cause it sure seems like it isn't bad.  You know it gets down to 132 something and that's pretty good.

DOCTOR N837
It's just less than, but I think that over 145 a lot.

PATIENT N837
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.  Well I would like the lab work in like 1-2 weeks or so, whenever you go to get your eye appointment.

PATIENT N837
When I come in to the eye appointment can I automatically go down and get my blood and then.

DOCTOR N837
Just tell them that your doctor ordered the lab work.

PATIENT N837
Great.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.

PATIENT N837
That'll take care of it.

DOCTOR N837
But I would like to get it done within the next month or so.

PATIENT N837
Okay cause right now I'm without a car.  My car has bad brakes and we're working on it and uh so now I got a driver driving me in.

DOCTOR N837
Okay.

PATIENT N837
And I think I just lost a friend, I don't think he'll drive me down again.

DOCTOR N837
And now I need to have you come back in about six months.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
Um so I'm finishing up in the program in June.

PATIENT N837
Oh bummer, that's great for you.

DOCTOR N837
So when you come back you'll probably be with a different resident.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
Um I'm actually staying around, I'll be in Cardiology.

PATIENT N837
Okay.

DOCTOR N837
So I'll be around it just won't be here.
