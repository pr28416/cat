DOCTOR O951
PATIENT?

PATIENT O951
Yes sir.

DOCTOR O951
Hello.

PATIENT O951
How you doing?

DOCTOR O951
Alright, how have you been doing?

PATIENT O951
Doing pretty good.

DOCTOR O951
Alright.  Issues, concerns, complaints?

PATIENT O951
Well I'm down to 167 so that's seven pounds I've lost.

DOCTOR O951
From 267, you're weight.

PATIENT O951
That's what I mean, 167 is what I want to be.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.  How much have you lost?

PATIENT O951
Seven pounds since the last time I saw you, which ain't a lot but.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.  How's the smoking going?

PATIENT O951
I got a patch on.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
I got the gum in my mouth and I'm taking that pill.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah when was the last time you smoked?

PATIENT O951
Last weekend, not this past weekend but last weekend I had a puff off of one.  I'd forgotten how bad those pills make the cigarettes taste.

DOCTOR O951
Taste.

PATIENT O951
I had one puff and gave the cigarette back to the guy.

DOCTOR O951
Okay.  I saw you went to the Diabetes Classes and completed all that and it all went well.  

PATIENT O951
I meant to bring that worksheet with my blood pressure.

DOCTOR O951
Oh your sugar.

PATIENT O951
Glucose readings on it.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.  You been checking it?  How have they been running?

PATIENT O951
Uh a couple of times they've been a little high but each time it was higher than it's supposed to be I stop and thought back and found the reason why.

DOCTOR O951
What you ate.

PATIENT O951
And uh normally it's right within the guidelines.  

DOCTOR O951
I'll have you stop by the Lab so you can get labs done.  Did you eat today this morning already?

PATIENT O951
Yeah.

DOCTOR O951
You did okay.  I still might have you go down and just get one of the lab tests.  I just kind of want to see where your diabetes shifts your numbers at and see how you come out and what we've been doing on that.  

PATIENT O951
I've changed my dietary habits.

DOCTOR O951
Diet say you have changed your diet.

PATIENT O951
I'm eating my big meal at lunch now.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
Instead of in the evenings and I have a salad for my evening meal.

DOCTOR O951
Very good.

PATIENT O951
Which my Coumadin doctor and I are working hard to.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah that can, yeah that can be one thing, salads especially something with spinach and things like that can cause those.

PATIENT O951
Those green veggies.  But it's not that far off and we'll get it caught, adjusted here soon.  

DOCTOR O951
I needed to look at all you had.  Going through your meds, and it's got the gum and all that stuff, you're using that.  You're using your inhaler still.

PATIENT O951
That reminds me.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
That new inhaler they sent me.  That one.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
Uh that seems to me that it's for more for asthma than COPD from what I've heard.

DOCTOR O951
No you can use Symbicort for.

PATIENT O951
And I've also heard that that's not, it's got some nasty side effects.  I don't know if it's true or not but I thought I'd check.

DOCTOR O951
This one you've been on, they haven't changed anything, let's see is this the one that we changed?

PATIENT O951
Yeah this is the new one to replace my formoterol and the other one.

DOCTOR O951
So the formoterol and @@@.  Cause I know the VA has been changing around some of these inhalers.  Did they send you a note saying that?

PATIENT O951
Yeah and then about two weeks ago I got this.

DOCTOR O951
Okay.  Have you used it at all?

PATIENT O951
No I'm still finishing off the last of my.

DOCTOR O951
I mean it's a similar, different name for the medication but they use the same thing so the side effects and profile should be the same.

PATIENT O951
But it said, it said in the directions not to take this more than twice a day.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah so this one you don't want to take this more than twice a day.  No this is more of your kind of your maintenance one.  The one that you can take if you need is the albuterol, if you need.  You got acute shortness of breath?

PATIENT O951
The uh.

DOCTOR O951
The Combivent or the albuterol ipratropium.  You have two inhalers correct?

PATIENT O951
Is that the pink one?

DOCTOR O951
I'm not sure what color it is.

PATIENT O951
Where you screw the top off or is it a.

DOCTOR O951
Oh probably more like this one.

PATIENT O951
Well that, this is replacing that.

DOCTOR O951
Which should be replacing.

PATIENT O951
Two things.

DOCTOR O951
Let's see if I can find the Pharmacy note, it'll show.  Yeah so this is replacing formoterol the capsule one that you were doing.

PATIENT O951
Right.

DOCTOR O951
That's what this one is replacement.  So that one, this is the one you should be taking um as the not as needed one but as you take as a control medication.  The one that you should take if you get short of breath is the other one which is the puffer, the Combivent.

PATIENT O951
I thought that it said that this was replacing.

DOCTOR O951
No this one's replacing.

PATIENT O951
Two of my.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah it's got two medications.  Its two medications but they're all together.

PATIENT O951
Yeah but, it, I thought it said that this was replacing two of them, the formoterol and the puffer.

DOCTOR O951
No, no.  The one that it's replacing is the same @@@.  Yeah so before you were on a combination one, formoterol and mometasone.  Budesonide.  So oh yeah you're right on that.  So you should still have the other inhaler though.  Yeah you're right so you were on the formoterol and the mometasone inhaler so it's those two inhalers but you had three inhalers right?  You had also the Combivent.

PATIENT O951
Yeah.

DOCTOR O951
So this was replacing the formoterol and the mometasone and getting this one box now and that one is the one you take just long-acting twice a day and then you should still have the Combivent which is albuterol and ipratropium, that's the one you use but yeah basically those two medications in this are similar and one is exactly the same as formoterol is still in here and mometasone is the steroid and this is a different steroid, budesonide which is also a steroid but it's exactly the same so that's how that should work now.

PATIENT O951
Okay then I will still have that other puffer?

DOCTOR O951
You'll still have the other one for as needed, the Combivent.

PATIENT O951
In case.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.

PATIENT O951
Okay.  I can live with that.

DOCTOR O951
Sorry I was a little confused.

PATIENT O951
So was I.

DOCTOR O951
Are you still taking the Lasix?  Furosemide?

PATIENT O951
Yeah.

DOCTOR O951
I think actually the last time I told you to start taking that potassium?

PATIENT O951
Yes.

DOCTOR O951
Your potassium was low so that's one of the things I want to do is to check and see where your potassium is and we may have to go up depending on where it's at.  I'm just reordering.  You're on the lisinopril still, and you're taking the niacin still?

PATIENT O951
Yeah.

DOCTOR O951
And Topamax, Coumadin, the Coumadin Clinic is following you for that and you're on the simvastatin still.

PATIENT O951
Yep.

DOCTOR O951
And you're on the metformin.  Are you still taking the glucosamine and the aspirin?

PATIENT O951
I don't take any glucosamine any more but I take the aspirin.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah right.  

PATIENT O951
It's the baby.

DOCTOR O951
Yep that's the one for the cardiovascular.

PATIENT O951
Yeah.

DOCTOR O951
Benefit okay.  I think that's the medications list for now.  No fevers, chills, night sweats?

PATIENT O951
I have night sweats all the time.

DOCTOR O951
You do sweat at night?

PATIENT O951
Uh but it's hot in my apartment.

DOCTOR O951
Oh I see.  It's hotter right now.

PATIENT O951
I haven't got it adjusted for summer yet so.

DOCTOR O951
Any problems with vision, eyes?  No.  No chest pain, shortness of, do you get short of breath on occasion?

PATIENT O951
Occasionally.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.

PATIENT O951
Hopefully not as much now that I've quit smoking.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah totally that'll help with the shortness of breath.  Diarrhea, constipation?

PATIENT O951
Since I've changed my eating habits.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
My bowel movements have changed considerably.  I feel like I'm a little constipated for a couple of days and then I'm fine.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.

PATIENT O951
But I think it's more that I'm not constipated it's just that I don't eat as much.

DOCTOR O951
Sure.

PATIENT O951
So I don't have to go as much.

DOCTOR O951
So less in, less out.  Uh urination problems, problems urinating?

PATIENT O951
Taking 160 mg of furosemide.

DOCTOR O951
Lasix yeah.  How's the swell, do you have swelling, how is the swelling?

PATIENT O951
It's fine.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.

PATIENT O951
I keep it under control.  

DOCTOR O951
Under control.

PATIENT O951
And that's also for the water around my heart they tell me.

DOCTOR O951
Okay.

PATIENT O951
So.

DOCTOR O951
Do you see Cardiology?  Do you see Cardiology here?

PATIENT O951
Uh probably.  I've seen just about everybody.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah, yeah.  Take a look.  You've been taking 1000 mg of the metformin right?  So you have been taking that, we got repeat labs in January.  We had saw an improvement, I think I talked to you it went from 8.6, your sugar, your three month sugar number went from 8.9 to 7.5 on the metformin so that improved but we might add another medication here today if you're still not, our goal is for you to be below 7 and you're at 7.5.  Probably one more medication will probably have you be closer to making your goal.  And you saw Ophthalmology and that was here recently, the eye doctors.

PATIENT O951
Yeah.

DOCTOR O951
A few days ago.

PATIENT O951
Yep.

DOCTOR O951
They said your eyes didn't have any diabetic changes and you saw Podiatry on the 12th there and your bladder, you saw, you just had a procedure done by your urologist and it doesn't look like they saw anything suspicious.

PATIENT O951
Right.

DOCTOR O951
Or anything as far as that goes.  Your blood pressure looks good today.  Your a fib.  Your heart rate is controlled.  Overall you feel like your breathing is relatively stable, the COPD is @@@ better.

PATIENT O951
I get out of breath if I walk very far.  

DOCTOR O951
How far can you go before you get out of breath?

PATIENT O951
Depends on how fast I'm walking.  Uh half a block, a block.

DOCTOR O951
Half a block okay.  No chest pain though.

PATIENT O951
No.

DOCTOR O951
You just get short of breath.  Work on the smoking, pneumonia, you got the flu shot.  I know before you were not interested in the colonoscopy in the past, still not interested in it?  Okay.  Um let me see immunization wise you had a tetanus done.  You’re 68. So the only other vaccine that I'd recommend right now would be, have you ever heard of shingles?

PATIENT O951
I've had shingles.

DOCTOR O951
You've had it.  How long ago did you have it?

PATIENT O951
Before I come here and all I had was one little spot right up here.

DOCTOR O951
Is that right.

PATIENT O951
And it didn't hurt.

DOCTOR O951
Oh really.

PATIENT O951
But I didn't know what it was so the doctors eventually took a sample.

DOCTOR O951
Sample of it.

PATIENT O951
Sample of it and then he sent me to somebody who specialized in it.

DOCTOR O951
Oh.

PATIENT O951
Something like that and he gave me some medications.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah so if you've had it before and it was not painful though for you.

PATIENT O951
No it wasn't.

DOCTOR O951
Generally it's really painful.

PATIENT O951
That's why I didn't think that's what I had.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah so generally it's painful.  I mean since you've had it once before it could possibly come back.  I don't know but there is a vaccine, they have a shingles vaccine that's out now.  Again it doesn't guarantee that it won't happen but it should decrease your risk by 75% of it reoccurring.  It's a one time shot if you're interested in that.  We could do that today.

PATIENT O951
Um I got no problem with it.

DOCTOR O951
With it, okay.  Then otherwise you're up-to-date on your pneumonia, the tetanus and you're good for the year so I'll put that in and you can get it on the way out the door here today.  

PATIENT O951
Before I go anywhere I'm going to have to go to the john.

DOCTOR O951
Sure.

PATIENT O951
Not right now but.

DOCTOR O951
Okay yeah.  When I got to go talk to them I'll look you over here and then I'll go talk to the docs outside the door you can probably come on back and then I think I'll have you go downstairs and get those labs drawn today to make sure @@@ and all that's where it should be.  Using the CPAP still at night?

PATIENT O951
Yes.

DOCTOR O951
@@@.

PATIENT O951
I cannot lay down without it.

DOCTOR O951
Your shortness of breath.

PATIENT O951
I get real.

DOCTOR O951
Do you sleep with pillow propped up at night or can you lay flat on your back to sleep?

PATIENT O951
Uh I've got one small pillow.

DOCTOR O951
You sleep on it.

PATIENT O951
That I have my head on.

DOCTOR O951
Sure.

PATIENT O951
And but I sleep on my back, my sides, my stomach.  I'm a restless sleeper.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah okay.  Could you have a seat over on the table for me?  

PATIENT O951
I got this one on.

DOCTOR O951
And I think if we can keep moving in the right direction, not go back to smoking and keep hold of that and keep losing weight.  You know I mean it takes time and you didn't put all that weight on you know cause we're pretty much going through the process.

PATIENT O951
I put, I weighed 185 and I quit smoking the first time.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
And in 30 days I gained 60 pounds.

DOCTOR O951
Wow.

PATIENT O951
But I had those pretzel rods in my mouth all the time.  I was eating candy.  I was eating anything I could get my hands on and the bad thing is it's all around the organ fat.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah, yeah, this is the bad kind of fat yeah.  The central obesity is what the name is.  Unfortunately that's the kind associated with all the risks of the heart disease.

PATIENT O951
Yep.

DOCTOR O951
And all that, that's it.

PATIENT O951
But back then I was working still so.

DOCTOR O951
Hmm.

PATIENT O951
It wasn't so bad.

DOCTOR O951
I'll take a listen here to you.  Take a listen to the lungs, deep breath for me.  

PATIENT O951
It’s hot in this hospital.

DOCTOR O951
Unfortunately they don't get the air in here at all.  I think we're not used to having 80 degree weather in March.  Open your mouth for me okay.  

PATIENT O951
I’m losing all my teeth.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.  Pain with any of them there?

PATIENT O951
Uh I had some a while back and they pulled it.

DOCTOR O951
Pulled it.  Where did they work on it, here atthe VA or do you go?

PATIENT O951
Well they pulled it because it was an emergency because I don't have dental coverage.

DOCTOR O951
What's your, are you service-connected here at all?  No, yeah.  Yeah you can't go to the Dental Clinic here unless you have some service-connected I think it's pretty much @@@.

PATIENT O951
No I was stationed in the middle of Kansas.  At a south base.

DOCTOR O951
So that's not too far away.

PATIENT O951
No.  As a matter of fact my grandmother lived in that town.

DOCTOR O951
Is that right?  Let me take a look at your legs here.  They're not too bad.

PATIENT O951
Before I started taking the furosemide.

DOCTOR O951
That big around?

PATIENT O951
Yeah.

DOCTOR O951
That's keeps them in check huh.  Yeah very, very minimal.  How long you been on the furosemide for?

PATIENT O951
Yeah.

DOCTOR O951
Check your feet and all that?

PATIENT O951
I have a podiatrist that comes in to the uh housing complex I live.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
He volunteers his time two Saturdays a month.

DOCTOR O951
Okay, so you keep a close eye on the feet.

PATIENT O951
That’s the only doctor I see that's not VA and he's free.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.  Well that's nice of him to volunteer his time.  No pain anywhere in the belly or anything like that?

PATIENT O951
Nope.

DOCTOR O951
Well alright.

PATIENT O951
Considering the shape I'm in, I'm healthy as a horse.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.  @@@ not feeling too bad @@@.

PATIENT O951
I get along with the people in the complex.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
We uh go out to dinner once a month; out to lunch I should say.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
And they have dinners at the complex once a month.  I belong to the @@@ Club and they have a dinner once a month.

DOCTOR O951
I see.

PATIENT O951
So I get, three times a month I eat with somebody else.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
And then I got to make good friends with one fella and he and I go out every now and then.  

DOCTOR O951
Good.  You ever been on fish oil, taking fish oil?

PATIENT O951
Yes I have.

DOCTOR O951
Were you having a bad, you know why you stopped it?

PATIENT O951
I'm sorry?

DOCTOR O951
You don't know why you stopped it?

PATIENT O951
Couldn't afford it.

DOCTOR O951
Oh couldn't afford it okay.

PATIENT O951
I was getting, it wasn’t something.

DOCTOR O951
It wasn't through the VA?

PATIENT O951
Right.

DOCTOR O951
You weren't getting it.  I think you can get it through the VA.  I mean your cholesterol, as far as your numbers go, the ones that we had from before, your LDL is your bad cholesterol, that goal is where it should be.  Your HDL is pretty low; it should be above 40 so you're at 15 which is really low.  I know medication will help you get it stabilized due to the central obesity and it can also be a lot of that can be familial in other words the family.  So I think we can try to get it up a few extra points but let me go ask one of the other doctors.  If you need to use the restroom, you can step outside and you can use the restroom.

PATIENT O951
I intend to.

DOCTOR O951
@@@.

PATIENT O951
Yeah.  I did this the last time I was here.

(DOCTOR OUT:  48:25  DOCTOR IN:  59:59)

DOCTOR O951
Alright.

PATIENT O951
Oh, I forgot to tell you, I saw you on December 4th.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
On December 9th we had ice out in Mission Park.

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O951
I slipped on the ice and broke my arm.

DOCTOR O951
Is that right?

PATIENT O951
Right there.

DOCTOR O951
Oh did you heal up?  Where'd you go for that?

PATIENT O951
Came up here for it.

DOCTOR O951
Oh did you?

PATIENT O951
I come here for everything.

DOCTOR O951
They put you in a cast?

PATIENT O951
They, I was in the splint for a week and then two different casts and then a splint that I could take off and exercise five times a day.

DOCTOR O951
I see that, alright that's Ortho, oh yeah.  I think I remember seeing that.  So how's the arm doing since then?

PATIENT O951
It's still a little weak but getting better.  The more I use it the better it is.  68 years old, that's the first time I ever broke a bone.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah.

PATIENT O951
But don't let me near something sharp cause I got more scar tissue than you got hair.

DOCTOR O951
Um alright, let's see a couple things.  So we talked to you, I'm sorry I'm going to start you on one more medication to try and get the diabetes under control.  I'm going to try and switch to there's something called gliptin which is one of the non-formularies and I'd use it than using the other one so I'm going to put through to see if you can get it through here.  Alright so I'm putting it as a non-formulary medication, while you should use a formulary @@@ we'll use one of the other ones called glipizide which is the other one medication you can use.  This one is just a little bit better, it has a little mild maybe weight loss advantage, more of a weight control but we will see uh I can't guarantee how @@@.  Still the government unfortunately.

PATIENT O951
Yep.

DOCTOR O951
Um but I'll put it in here.  So and then I'll call you and let you know.

PATIENT O951
Okay.

DOCTOR O951
Either way, if it is it's a once a day medication they'll send out and it @@@ good.  If not I will call and make them send the other one.  And then the only other thing I've got to bring up is your lipids.  I think we also need to start taking the fish oil again, if you're getting that through the VA and taking the fish oil.

PATIENT O951
Sure.

DOCTOR O951
That doesn't have much side effect and it might help a little bit with your lipids.  So I'll let you know, take one of these twice a day capsule and the only other thing, did anyone ever talk to you about the MOVE Program?  This is a diet program, exercise program.  I don't know if you'd be interested in that, it's here at the VA.  I think it's on Tuesday for eight weeks in a row or something.  I don't know how hard it is for you to get in the MOVE and come back.

PATIENT O951
It's a long way.

DOCTOR O951
Oh is it okay.

PATIENT O951
Ristin Park, do you know where that's at?

DOCTOR O951
Uh-huh so you're quite a ways away oh, okay.

PATIENT O951
About 40 miles.

DOCTOR O951
Sure.  Oh you're a ways off so that's not reasonable.

PATIENT O951
Which is why I often go down to Rubinay for the blood draws.

DOCTOR O951
That's right; I know you had said that before.  So we'll make those changes.  Stop by and get the labs here today cause I want to see, so go to the lab right now since you're not fasting we might need a little bit of adjusting on that.  Uh and then we'll bring you back again in about two months to kind of see how things are going with the diabetes um and we'll do that shingles vaccine today and labs today.  Alright.

PATIENT O951
Sounds good to me.

DOCTOR O951
@@@.  Let me get you out and let me find a nurse here to give you that vaccine and then we'll get you to the Lab.  (Doctor talks to nurse)  We'll find someone here to do the vaccine and we'll get you out of here okay?

PATIENT O951
Sounds good to me.  Take care.

DOCTOR O951
Yeah you too.
