Time of Encounter:  @@@

SECOND PERSON I642
Here I am.

PATIENT I642
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON I642
He called your name and didn't see you.  How are you good.

PATIENT I642
Pardon?

SECOND PERSON I642
How are you?

DOCTOR I642
@@@.

SECOND PERSON I642
Okay.

DOCTOR I642
Been real busy today.   I'm trying to; uh excuse me for one second okay.  Alrighty.  So, I've been looking through your chart a little to try and make sure you know take a look at things that have been happening and it sounds like you know, we kinda figured out what was going on with the blood pressure medications you know.

SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I642
You know.  Uh what they did in Neurology, when they did the Dopplers they were concerned that you know there was basically a whole, occlusion of one side of the blood that goes to the brain basically.  So when we lowered your blood pressure with the medications it was causing the blood pressure to be low enough that there were parts of the brain that were not happy with it because all the blood was being supplied by this other section basically.  So obviously we're gonna hold off on the blood pressure okay.  How have you been feeling since we've been holding off on the blood pressure medication, better, worse, same?

PATIENT I642
Some days are pretty good and then other days I don't feel too good.

DOCTOR I642
Okay.  More often good days than bad days?

PATIENT I642
Well uh, more often good days.

DOCTOR I642
Has it improved at all since changing the way you were taking your medications?  I know you were dizzy all the time and.

PATIENT I642
Yeah I was dizzy @@@ but it wasn't bad you know.

DOCTOR I642
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I642
But some days it's much worse you know.

DOCTOR I642
Any new you numb, weakness, numbness, tingling anywhere?

PATIENT I642
Yeah I still have tingling up in the head @@@.

DOCTOR I642
Okay.  @@@

PATIENT I642
Yeah.

DOCTOR I642
@@@.  So the brain doctors, when you saw them, thought you know the tingling in the hand was consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome.

SECOND PERSON I642
Hmm.

DOCTOR I642
On your @@@ side.  Basically it's nothing dangerous okay.  Something just you know there's a nerve bundle that goes through the wrist here and its just a little too tight for it, so it gets irritated and so it gets that numbness and tingling okay.  What I'm really worried about is more strokes and things like that,  okay.  So um, why haven't you guys gone back to follow-up with the brain doctors?

SECOND PERSON I642
No we have, so with the neurologist?

DOCTOR I642
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON I642
When did they want to see @@@ I didn’t know he had another one @@@.

DOCTOR I642
Well apparently.

SECOND PERSON I642
Cause like I called when we got a reminder and the receptionist said that we had made the appointment already so we didn't have to worry about making another one, we just got the reminder, if they needed to see us they would let us know.

DOCTOR I642
So, let's get you back to Neurology and do a consult.  I think they wanted to see you after all the MRIs and stuff like that.  To see if there’s any usefulness in me opening this up, okay.  So @@@ I think we'll set it up.

SECOND PERSON I642
I know.

DOCTOR I642
I know you had something like this done before where they would go in and open up the artery to see @@@ wasn’t clogged any more. Um.  It might make a difference in how the @@@ and how you feel okay and it may or may not prevent more strokes.  I'm not sure about that to be honest um but it may be something we can work on.  Um.

SECOND PERSON I642
@@@ too.  He just saw, was that the nurse that they were calling @@@?  What was his findings on that, you said something about his pressure was high?

DOCTOR I642
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON I642
Something else was low?

DOCTOR I642
His heart rate is a little low.

SECOND PERSON I642
Okay his heart rate.  Cause you know I was thinking on my way in, he said he was feeling a little dizzy as he was coming in and I looked at his sugars @@@.

DOCTOR I642
Um, the last time he was here, do you know what it was last, it was on the lower side @@@ 40s, 50s.

SECOND PERSON I642
@@@ in the past.

PATIENT I642
@@@.

SECOND PERSON I642
@@@.

DOCTOR I642
@@@ they did an echo for you right?

PATIENT I642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I642
No.  You did that @@@ right?  Or @@@ everything else.

PATIENT I642
@@@.

SECOND PERSON I642
No @@@ cardiologist too @@@.

PATIENT I642
Yeah.

DOCTOR I642
Well we'll probably do another EKG for you today okay.  Um do me a favor; uh take off your shirt as much as possible.  Are you going to be cold? @@@ a little bit, left me see if I have @@@.  Take off both your shirts for me, @@@ machine @@@.

PATIENT I642
Okay.

SECOND PERSON I642

PATIENT I642

SECOND PERSON I642

PATIENT I642
Okay.

DOCTOR I642
Just lie flat.

SECOND PERSON I642
He might need some help.

DOCTOR I642
Do you need help lifting up your legs or?  Excellent.  Probably get a little bit @@@.  I'll just put some more stickers on your leg now and everybody's smart wearing like two layers of pants.  I’m not that smart.  All my patients today have been uh I'm like wow you guys are really smart cause I'm freezing when I'm walking on the outside.  @@@  

PATIENT I642
Sure.

DOCTOR I642
Connect all these stickers to these wires and let's just put the @@@ here okay.

PATIENT I642
Okay.

DOCTOR I642
@@@.  Alright while I'm doing this I'm just going to ask some more questions okay.  No blood in the stool, no black stool?

PATIENT I642
No.

DOCTOR I642
Appetite's good.

PATIENT I642

SECOND PERSON I642

PATIENT I642

DOCTOR I642
No changes in your weight right?  No changes in your stool.

PATIENT I642
@@@ clothes on.

DOCTOR I642
Good.  Alright I want you to just breathe regular and don't move your arms and legs okay.

PATIENT I642
Okay.

DOCTOR I642

PATIENT I642
Yeah.

DOCTOR I642
I'm gonna do just one more okay.  @@@ alright @@@.  Do you want me to take @@@ souvenirs? @@@ stickers on it or should I take them off?  @@@.  

PATIENT I642
Well usually @@@ getting back to work.

DOCTOR I642
Wow you are a very ambitious gentleman.

PATIENT I642
@@@

DOCTOR I642
Let me ask you a question um, what type of work do you do?  @@@.

PATIENT I642
@@@ Security. Drive around.

DOCTOR I642
Drive around @@@ I'd like to see you a little better in terms of your dizziness at first before you get back @@@.  I don't want you exerting yourself too much right now. Until we figure out.  

PATIENT I642
Cause I don't know how long they're holding my job for me.

DOCTOR I642
Oh I see.

PATIENT I642
The pressure is on here.

DOCTOR I642
@@@.

PATIENT I642
I need the work.

DOCTOR I642
For the money.  When are you gonna be able to take a break?  You know you're getting on in your years you know.

PATIENT I642
When I die. (Laughs)  But the bills don’t stop, they keep coming in, they just try to @@@.

DOCTOR I642
Do you live by yourself.

PATIENT I642
No @@@.

DOCTOR I642
Think of what I'm saying.

PATIENT I642
@@@.

DOCTOR I642
What kind of bills are we talking about?

PATIENT I642
Gas bills, light bills, car loans @@@.

DOCTOR I642
We'll talk about that in a second.

PATIENT I642
Taxes, property taxes, you know all that stuff.

DOCTOR I642
How much longer do you think you can take off before it becomes problematic?

PATIENT I642
From this job, I don’t know. @@@  But that's why they moved in @@@ latter part of November when I left.

DOCTOR I642
Do you have to do anything strenuous? I don't want to see you driving if you're dizzy, so if that’s that part of your job that you so, I don't think you should do.

SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I642
Even if you go back there I would not recommend, you can put on your clothing, but I would not, when it comes down to you not @@@.  Um if you really had to go back to work, about @@@ dizziness.

PATIENT I642
Yeah.

DOCTOR I642
But if you have to go back to work I'd recommend activities where you’re not going to be chasing down anybody, you're not doing any type of heavy lifting.  But still you could monitor and watch the screen and I think that'd be okay but any type of long patrolling where you're gonna be walking unsteady or on icy areas or anything like that I don't really recommend that okay.  

PATIENT I642
@@@.

SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I642
@@@ maybe one time you know.  So my only shelter is in the car @@@.  So I'm gonna have to hole up I guess.

SECOND PERSON I642
Yes.

PATIENT I642
Nothing to do about it.

DOCTOR I642
I want to bring you back to see the brain doctors and you can see what they recommend in terms of if this needs to be fixed or um and I want you to see improvement @@@ in terms of your dizziness but I have to be honest uh you're getting on in the age where I prefer to see my patients things a little more easier.

SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh. Me too.

PATIENT I642
Alright.

SECOND PERSON I642
@@@.

DOCTOR I642
I know you've got bills to pay um but your, is there anything else you can cut back on so that you don't have to work?  Are you getting Social Security benefits and things like that already?

PATIENT I642
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I642
And that's not.

PATIENT I642
Won't cover it.  That's only about a thousand a month.

SECOND PERSON I642
Then we didn't have nothing in savings for a little while.

DOCTOR I642
What about a different kind of job, @@@ you find you're in a position where you get to watch monitors @@@ security rather than just walking around or driving?  Cause that's reasonable for me if you’re not.

PATIENT I642
I don't know.

DOCTOR I642
You don't, they don't require you to drive where you can just hang out at some place for a while, not worry about slipping on ice and falling @@@.

PATIENT I642
Uh. I don’t know

SECOND PERSON I642
See the other thing is @@@. Is just, is just @@@ around the block.

DOCTOR I642
Okay.

PATIENT I642
@@@ about a block, a block and a half long where I travel around.

SECOND PERSON I642
Do you get out at all?

PATIENT I642
Yeah, I get out and uh @@@ and go on to the next station.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON I642
Then get in the car and ride on to the next one.

PATIENT I642
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON I642
Okay you know @@@ get back around @@@.

PATIENT I642
Right.

SECOND PERSON I642
All day.

PATIENT I642
@@@.  That's what I say.

SECOND PERSON I642
So just basically now @@@.

PATIENT I642
@@@.

DOCTOR I642
How about this, I can't tell you not to not to feed yourself, uh but let's say let's put it off as long as possible, talk to your employer and maybe see if they can work something out where there's less you know, being able to hopefully when the weather gets a little better or less – but you still have to drive, though.

PATIENT I642
I'll walk.  

DOCTOR I642
You'll walk.

PATIENT I642
About a block a day.

DOCTOR I642
Are you, @@@ are you driving on the street or is it all over in the parking lot?

PATIENT I642
No @@@, in a big lot.

SECOND PERSON I642
In the @@@ houses.

PATIENT I642
It's just.

SECOND PERSON I642
@@@.

PATIENT I642
One big lot that's what it is.

DOCTOR I642
Okay.  So you're not in any danger of having to worry about other cars?

PATIENT I642
No, no.

SECOND PERSON I642
No.  Not until it's time to go home.  Then he drive on the street to come back home.

PATIENT I642
That doesn't bother anybody but me.

SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I642
You know as your doctor I can't say that it's okay for you to drive.

PATIENT I642
I understand.

DOCTOR I642
Uh but you know driving around an empty lumber yard is better than driving in traffic.

PATIENT I642
Okay.

SECOND PERSON I642
True.

DOCTOR I642
Um we're gonna leave it at that.

PATIENT I642
Alright @@@.

DOCTOR I642
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON I642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I642
Well my advice is to put it off as long as possible, talk to your employer, see how long they can hold your job for and how @@@ and take it from there.  But while we're holding it off I want to make sure you go back to see the brain the neurologist okay and let them take it from there okay.  I'm certainly sensitive to what you're saying.  You need to take care of yourself.  You can't, if you don't have housing, if you don't have food, it's hard to take care of other things. I completely understand that, okay.  Give me one second; I want to chat with DOCTOR okay.

PATIENT I642
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  53:47  DOCTOR IN:  61:50)

DOCTOR I642
Sorry, @@@.  I'm not gonna do that much for you today but I'm gonna take you back to the brain neurologist and I'm also going to set you up with the vascular doctors okay.  The vascular doctors are the ones that would look at your neck to see if uh you would benefit opening whether we should open @@@ or not, okay.  I think those are really the people who would do you the most good in terms of hopefully getting better circulation to your brain, hopefully getting rid of the dizziness okay.  So I'm going to do that as soon as possible.  The other thing is um your cholesterol it's pretty good but it's still slightly high and for people who have this type of disease, @@@ usually we want your cholesterol a little lower okay.  Are you okay with uh taking a cholesterol medication?  Do you have any problems with taking the cholesterol medications?

PATIENT I642
No I'll give it a go.

DOCTOR I642
@@@.

PATIENT I642
@@@ I think I was supposed to @@@.

DOCTOR I642
I don't see that you're on it right now.

PATIENT I642
No I'm not.  I haven't take it for @@@.

DOCTOR I642
Are you okay with you restarting it again?

PATIENT I642
Yes.  That'll work.  I've taken it before, no problem.

DOCTOR I642
Okay.  It'll be a low dose.  I mean you're right on the borderline.

PATIENT I642
Yeah.  

DOCTOR I642
Okay cause we want you to be below at least 100, maybe even lower so we'll just start you on a low dose and see how you do with that.  Okay.

PATIENT I642
Yeah.

DOCTOR I642
That's the only thing I would change in terms of your medication.

PATIENT I642
Okay.

DOCTOR I642
Now your blood pressure looked okay today.  Heart looks okay today.  Um if you're consistently low like this and you're still having your dizziness I might send you back to um what we'd do, is what we call doing a Holter basically.  A Holter is, they just strap something along, or maybe it’s stickers, I'm not sure but it's just to monitor your heart rate over a certain time okay.  If the vascular doctors don't think this is causing the dizziness I may do that Holter okay.  To see if the low heart rate is the reason why you're uh dizzy.

PATIENT I642
Okay.

DOCTOR I642
To be honest I'm not sure that it is.  Your blood pressure is @@@, okay.

PATIENT I642
I don't have to go back to the MRI thing anymore?

DOCTOR I642
You didn't like that huh?

PATIENT I642
No, I don't want to go back and do that.

DOCTOR I642
Well I don't want to speak for the vascular doctors but my perspective is that you know we've already documented your anatomy, we know that there's a narrowing there, we know you've had strokes in the past um so I don't know what we'd gain from that um but I can't speak for other clinics okay.  And if they order it make sure you let them know that you're very anxious and you didn't like it and maybe they can give you some medication to relax you.

SECOND PERSON I642
That's what I told him.

DOCTOR I642
Okay.  Alright um let me order the medication that I want to give you.  It's called simvastatin okay.

SECOND PERSON I642
I take that.

DOCTOR I642
Uh and so you need to look out for you know some muscle aches um sometimes it can cause that but very rarely okay.  Um let's see when was the last time we checked your liver functions, usually we like to have a baseline before we do that.  Okay.  Okay checked in November and it was perfect.  So um I can go ahead and start the medication but after a month and after you've been taking we usually check your liver again to see if you're doing okay.

PATIENT I642
Okay.

DOCTOR I642
Cause sometimes this can interact with the liver a little bit.

PATIENT I642
Oh.

DOCTOR I642
Give me one second; I want to put in the referral to the vascular doctor okay.  I @@@ give me one second.  @@@ are the doctors.  Alright, so do me a favor, when you go back outside you're going to need two appointments made okay.  Neurology next available and I want you to see Peripheral Vascular Surgery also next available.  I want you to see them as soon as possible okay.  And then for me would two months sound reasonable for you guys or is that too soon?  Cause I want to make sure that nothing gets dropped and doctors see you the appropriate tests.  @@@.  Or you can see me you know.  I just want to make sure it's okay with you because you know if I bring you back too much and you don't like me anymore then I don't want that to happen.

PATIENT I642
No that's fine.

DOCTOR I642
Of course you have a choice, that's why I asked.  You know I want to make sure it's okay with you that I bring you back so often cause you know.  Normally I wouldn't see somebody as often as I would see you because I'm seeing so often cause I want to get as much stuff done as possible so you can go back to work when you need to and also I want to make sure that your dizziness gets better okay.  But I mean, but if it becomes a hardship for you to come see me so often, then of course we want to work together and make sure it doesn't become worse okay.  Before you come to see me next time, do me a favor, don't eat breakfast and we'll get some blood tests on you so um the next time you come see me in about two months, come a little earlier.  Whenever your appointment is come earlier so you can get the blood tests done at the Lab and then come see me afterwards.  Okay.

SECOND PERSON I642
So don't eat.

DOCTOR I642
Yeah, don't eat that morning.  Okay, but for today please make these two appointments up front okay.  

SECOND PERSON I642
Any more questions?  And you got @@@ earlier.

PATIENT I642
Hmm.

DOCTOR I642
Take your time, if you have questions, think about them for a little bit.  

SECOND PERSON I642
@@@.

PATIENT I642
Oh yeah.  Maybe they cut that out, I don't know.

SECOND PERSON I642
Maybe @@@ you don’t know.

DOCTOR I642
@@@ here for you.

PATIENT I642
Now at one time uh this was back in the 80s @@@.

DOCTOR I642
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I642
Monetarily.

DOCTOR I642
Monetarily.  Uh I think that's reasonable um. Let’s see.

PATIENT I642
I don't know if they still do it now.

DOCTOR I642
It’s certainly worth a try to ask. It’s certainly worth a try to ask. Let me see who to ask to find out. So when you go back up front there's a number, to a social worker number.

SECOND PERSON I642
What is it?

DOCTOR I642
And those would be the people you would talk to to see if you quality for any @@@ or things like that okay.

SECOND PERSON I642
Okay @@@ social worker.

DOCTOR I642
They will be the most up-to-date people who would know what you'd be qualified for okay.  But yeah, don't hesitate, okay.  Whatever we can do to help, definitely @@@ do it okay.

SECOND PERSON I642
That's it?

DOCTOR I642
That is it.

PATIENT I642
Okay good enough.

SECOND PERSON I642
Thank you sir.  You have a good day now.

DOCTOR I642
You two take care, uh-huh.
