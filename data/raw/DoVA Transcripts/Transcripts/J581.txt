DOCTOR J581
PATIENT?  

PATIENT J581
How you doing? 

DOCTOR J581
Doing fine.  How are you?

PATIENT J581
Good morning.

DOCTOR J581
Good morning sir.

PATIENT J581
Alright.

DOCTOR J581
Good to see you.

PATIENT J581
Good to be seen.

DOCTOR J581
Come on back.

PATIENT J581
Uh.  So you're not way in back anymore?

DOCTOR J581
Yeah there's, you know, moving and shaking it.

PATIENT J581
Okay, where do you want me?

DOCTOR J581
Right here is fine.

PATIENT J581
Okay.

DOCTOR J581
How are you?

PATIENT J581
Alright.

DOCTOR J581
How you been doing?

PATIENT J581
Good.

DOCTOR J581
Good.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
So let's see, what's new?

PATIENT J581
Not too much.  No problems, no pain, no aches.

DOCTOR J581
Good.  So um, let's see I wanted to get some labs um this morning to check the.

PATIENT J581
I know I've been down there.

DOCTOR J581
I saw that.  So, yeah I know where it is, okay it's a little lower than before, 2.05, the last one was 2.48.

PATIENT J581
Okay.

DOCTOR J581
Uh so it's still therapeutic.  Um did you eat this morning?

PATIENT J581
Yeah, well I've had some small rolls.

DOCTOR J581
Some rolls.

PATIENT J581
Uh with cinnamon and nut you know.

DOCTOR J581
So.

PATIENT J581
But uh.

DOCTOR J581
Your sugar today was 226 which is not very good.  But you ate this morning.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
And you got send a fasting specimen.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
Iâ€™d like to see it less.  The problem is the number that I really wanted was this glycosylated hemoglobin, that's the hemoglobin A1c number.  The drew it, but it's still running in lab because that's the number that tells us how you've been doing with your sugars over a three months span.

PATIENT J581
Hmm.  Oh.

DOCTOR J581
So it's our best way to see you know where you're at.

PATIENT J581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J581
Your last one, cause when did I see you last?

PATIENT J581
Couple months ago.

DOCTOR J581
Was it in February?

PATIENT J581
I think.

DOCTOR J581
It was 9.9, which is high and you want to be below 7.

PATIENT J581
Okay.

DOCTOR J581
And your last one was 8.7 so depending on how you've been doing; we may have to change up some of your medications uh today, because you weren't taking the metformin right?

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
So we switched you to the longer acting, just the one dose but 1000 mg right?

PATIENT J581
I guess.

DOCTOR J581
Have you been taking it?

PATIENT J581
No.

DOCTOR J581
No.  Why?

PATIENT J581
Uh I don't know.  I was still getting the diarrhea.

DOCTOR J581
Even this one?

PATIENT J581
No I haven't taken this one yet.

DOCTOR J581
So I thought we talked about this last time that the reason we switched this one.

PATIENT J581
I didn't know we switched, I thought I was still doing the regular metformin.

DOCTOR J581
No this one, remember we said we were gonna give you the one that was one pill 1000 mg because it has been shown to have less GI side effects, less diarrhea than the other one.

PATIENT J581
Oh okay.  Alright.

DOCTOR J581
So did they send those to you?

PATIENT J581
Yeah I got them.

DOCTOR J581
Yeah and you just didn't take them.

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
Okay.  So we definitely want to try that.

PATIENT J581
Okay.  Oh I got confused.  I guess I wasn't aware of that.

DOCTOR J581
Yeah.

PATIENT J581
That you changed the pill.

DOCTOR J581
Right.  So uh you know I.

PATIENT J581
Okay.

DOCTOR J581
You definitely want to try that.

PATIENT J581
Alright.

DOCTOR J581
Because I'm guessing since you are not taking it, your hemoglobin level, the sugar levels going to be real high.  

PATIENT J581
Okay.

DOCTOR J581
And you're still taking the glyburide right?

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
10 twice a day and what else, that's it right?

PATIENT J581
No.  Carvedilol or whatever.

DOCTOR J581
Well no for diabetes, just the.

PATIENT J581
Oh.

DOCTOR J581
The carvedilol.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
The aspirin, the albuterol when you need it, the inhaler.

PATIENT J581
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR J581
The Combivent medicine or Combivent inhaler.  The metformin, the lisinopril, you take the simvastatin and the Coumadin.

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
And the Coumadin.

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
Okay.  Otherwise how you been doing?

PATIENT J581
Fine, no problems.

DOCTOR J581
Another thing that we had to do was the Sleep Clinic.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
Just because we had talked about that, but you cancelled your appointment and said you didn't want to be seen.

PATIENT J581
Yeah I, I don't.

DOCTOR J581
So what happened?

PATIENT J581
Uh well I wasn't sure you know.  Like I say um I can't see where that's gonna be any benefit to me.  I mean I'm you know, I sleep fine.

DOCTOR J581
Well yeah, you do sleep fine but uh the problem is that the last sleep study that you had showed concern for a type of sleep apnea that we call central sleep apnea which could be a result of the previous strokes, cause you've had strokes in the past right?

PATIENT J581
In 2002 I had two strokes, that's the only strokes I've had.

DOCTOR J581
So you know that's what is very important for your future health.  We want to make sure that you in fact need it and that's why I wanted to do the sleep study test.  You know what I'm saying?

PATIENT J581
Yeah.  Well like I said I know a lot of people that have CPAPs and that uh, they don't use them anymore.  They put it aside.

DOCTOR J581
But that's that could be fine for them.

PATIENT J581
And uh.

DOCTOR J581
But you have different reasons why you need it.

PATIENT J581
Well also too uh one reason was the guy said it costs me $1000 and I ate got that kind of money.

DOCTOR J581
That's what he told you?

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
Okay.  Well I'm sure there are ways that we could subsidize that through the VA or something.  I'll have to look into that.

PATIENT J581
Right, well that's what the guy told me and that's why I said.

DOCTOR J581
I still think it, I still think it'd be worthwhile for you to be seen in that clinic but you're not interested at all?

PATIENT J581
No I'm not.  I'm not really interested in it.

DOCTOR J581
Okay.  Um because you know just so you know the danger of sleep apnea is you know increased blood pressure and um it can have effects on your lungs and your heart that can be, you know and given your diabetes and you're already uh history of heart failure and things like that, those are.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
You know what I mean it's uh; it will worsen those things if not treated.  So I just want you to be aware of that.

PATIENT J581
Yeah right, I know.

DOCTOR J581
And it's, you know, it's ultimately your decision what you do.

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
But I just want you to know.

PATIENT J581
I just as soon forget it.

DOCTOR J581
Okay.  Um and I saw that you saw the uh, you were seen in the Podiatry Clinic.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
Did they fix up your toes a little bit better?

PATIENT J581
Yeah, yeah.  I go to go back to them.

DOCTOR J581
Three months.

PATIENT J581
Oh three months from then.

DOCTOR J581
Oh from when they saw you.

PATIENT J581
From when they saw me.

DOCTOR J581
So um the only other thing is a colonoscopy.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
And uh they wanted me to let you know that you are at a little bit higher risk for that procedure um because of the sleep apnea, because of your COPD.  When they sedate you, uh sometimes it's just a little bit more dangerous um in those people because of your previous heart condition and your previous lung @@@.

PATIENT J581
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR J581
But they monitor all those things.

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
They just want you to be aware of that.

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
They wanted me to document that I talked to you about that.

PATIENT J581
Right.  Well when you say um a risk or whatever uh, I've never heard that before on a colonoscopy about being uh.

DOCTOR J581
Well because, it's because of the medicines that they give you to sedate you.  Um you know because you have the previous stroke and the atrial fibrillation and the COPD and the heart failure and the sleep apnea, you know it sometimes, the sedation is dangerous, it can depress your drive to breathe and sometimes will require people to be intubated you know.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
And that's the danger with that and so um, you know I wanted to make you aware of that and uh.

PATIENT J581
Well when you think about the risk.

DOCTOR J581
Right it's definitely increased because of your uh, you know underlying conditions.  I'm going to talk with my attending about it today and see.

PATIENT J581
Well.

DOCTOR J581
What he thinks but I.

PATIENT J581
Yeah well if I don't have a colonoscopy I mean there's a risk too.

DOCTOR J581
There's a risk of that too obviously.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
So I mean unfortunately you're a little bit between a rock and a hard place.  I think that, I think you'd probably be fine.  They like to be sure uh that we're comfortable with that.  So that's the only problem.

PATIENT J581
Well you'd be a better judge of that than I am.

DOCTOR J581
No absolutely.  Um and that's the only problem with the sleep apnea too is the fact that you're not using the CPAP at all so it puts you at a higher risk than someone.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
Someone that you know what I mean so, so.

PATIENT J581
I'll take a shot what the hell.  If I die, I die.

DOCTOR J581
Okay.  Well I don't.

PATIENT J581
I'm a Catholic, I that's just the beginning.

DOCTOR J581
Fair enough but uh I think we would obviously want to prevent that.

PATIENT J581
I know I would like to prevent it too.

DOCTOR J581
And I don't think that it will, I don't think it would come to that but uh.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
I'll ask my attending to make sure he's comfortable with it, but I think.

PATIENT J581
Okay.

DOCTOR J581
It should be okay.

PATIENT J581
Alright.

DOCTOR J581
Otherwise you're good on your meds?

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
You have all your refills and things?

PATIENT J581
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR J581
Any recent weight changes, headaches, vision changes, fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, things like that?

PATIENT J581
No.

DOCTOR J581
Doing okay otherwise?

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
Okay.  Um cause the last time you said that your energy level had been down over the past six months to a year, do you still feel that way?

PATIENT J581
Yeah I'm 63.  I mean that's the problem with getting older.  You don't know, something happens and you don't know, is this something to be concerned about or is this just part of the aging process?

DOCTOR J581
Yeah.

PATIENT J581
I mean there's no book on aging.

DOCTOR J581
Right.  I definitely think that some of your uh fatigue is probably caused from the sleep apnea.

PATIENT J581
Uh.

DOCTOR J581
And so you know you can expect to be a little tired because you know, understand again what happens is that your throat closes when you're sleeping.

PATIENT J581
Oh.

DOCTOR J581
Because of the tissue in your neck.

PATIENT J581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J581
You stop breathing.

PATIENT J581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J581
But your body wakes you up enough that it allows you to take a deep breath but it doesn't actually wake you up so you don't know this is happening.  So um, so you never get into the dream state of sleep and so you wake up real tired.

PATIENT J581
Oh.

DOCTOR J581
The only way, unfortunately, to correct that is to use the CPAP machine.

PATIENT J581
Yeah well.

DOCTOR J581
And you're not interested in that.

PATIENT J581
No.

DOCTOR J581
So then there will be a component of fatigue.

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
And uh but um no shortness of breath, no sore throats, no weakness in your legs, you know urinating, moving your bowels okay, no problems?

PATIENT J581
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR J581
Your vision's okay?

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
Good.  Well have a seat up here I'm just going to take a quick listen to you and then have a seat.  What else is new, anything?

PATIENT J581
Nothing really.

DOCTOR J581
What'd you give up for Lent?

PATIENT J581
Nothing (laughter).  I didn't tell you I was a devout Catholic.

DOCTOR J581
Yeah.  Deep breaths.  Again, again, one more.  Okay.  Are you losing any weight at all?

PATIENT J581
Uh no.

DOCTOR J581
No, are you trying?

PATIENT J581
No.  I'm was back when I had my stroke @@@.

DOCTOR J581
How much do you weigh now?

PATIENT J581
250.  I tell you, I don't eat a lot uh you know.

DOCTOR J581
Yeah.  Alright uh yeah, so the glycosylated hemoglobin number is 10, up from 9.9 so you're headed in the wrong direction.  But if you haven't been taking the metformin.

PATIENT J581
I'll start taking it.

DOCTOR J581
Cause the problem is that if you don't take the metformin, the next thing to do is insulin shots.

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
And uh do you want me to just switch to that now?

PATIENT J581
No.

DOCTOR J581
Cause that's where we're heading.  The problem is that if we don't get your sugars under control, um we're going to put you on insulin.

PATIENT J581
Okay.

DOCTOR J581
You know what I mean so.  We really need to get the metformin going but.

PATIENT J581
Uh no like I said I'll do a better job of my sugar intakes.

DOCTOR J581
Okay.  But you're also; I think your body is just to the point where it needs medicine anyway.  It's not, I mean you still need to monitor your sugar intake, you know low carbs, no; you know less bread, less pastas all that stuff.

PATIENT J581
Right, right.

DOCTOR J581
Um but um your body needs help now because your pancreas is kind of shot at this point and so uh we need to give you these medicines to help.  So it's really important that you do take that metformin.

PATIENT J581
Okay, I'll take it when I get home.

DOCTOR J581
And let me know, if it's still not working.  You know and you're still getting the diarrhea.

PATIENT J581
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J581
And things like that then we may have to switch you to the insulin.

PATIENT J581
Alright.

DOCTOR J581
Okay.

PATIENT J581
Okay.

DOCTOR J581
Alright.  Let me chat with them real quick and I'll be right back.

PATIENT J581
Okay, okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  58:16  DOCTOR IN:  67:24)

DOCTOR J581
Okay, well you know I spoke to my attending and looking back at you know.  The reason we were doing colonoscopy is because you've never had it before.

PATIENT J581
Yeah.

DOCTOR J581
The truth is that the stool cards you've had uh in the past were negative.  You do have a lot of risks.  I don't want to mess with it so let's do the stool cards like you did before.

PATIENT J581
Alright.

DOCTOR J581
You know how to do these and everything?

PATIENT J581
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR J581
Okay.

PATIENT J581
Okay.

DOCTOR J581
And then uh I would like you to follow up in 3-4 weeks with one of our pharmacists here, just to make sure that the medications working okay, that metformin.

PATIENT J581
Okay.

DOCTOR J581
Um uh because I don't want you to go and not be takingâ€¦

PATIENT J581
Right.

DOCTOR J581
Just because of the side effects.

PATIENT J581
Alright.  Okie doke.

DOCTOR J581
And then um you know uh that's about it and I'll see you in three months.

PATIENT J581
Okay.  Take it easy doc.

DOCTOR J581
Alrighty.  This is for you.

PATIENT J581
Oh.

DOCTOR J581
It's something for when you check out.

PATIENT J581
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR J581

PATIENT J581
