Time of Encounter:  @@@ 

PATIENT W835
Oh.  Good morning.
 
DOCTOR W835
How are you?

PATIENT W835
Alright.

DOCTOR W835
@@@.

PATIENT W835
Thank you.

DOCTOR W835
@@@.  So @@@.

PATIENT W835
Anywhere in particular?

DOCTOR W835
Um let's see maybe you can set this chair over here.  Okay.  So I can't believe it's been such a long time.

PATIENT W835
I know.

DOCTOR W835
Since I've seen you.  I'm looking back @@@.

PATIENT W835
Oh my gosh really.

DOCTOR W835
Yes.

PATIENT W835
Time flies when you're having fun huh.

DOCTOR W835
Yeah so what's been going on?

PATIENT W835
Uh nothing, I donâ€™t ... and I've been trying to get a knee replacement but I've had um cellulitis so many times.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
We were just going to do it on February 24th and on February 20th I got it again.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.  Like right over the knee?  Is that where you're getting the?

PATIENT W835
No it was down the leg you know.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
You know here like.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
So it's been, with no wound, couldn't figure it out but.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
In the hospital for a week but, a few days, four days in.

DOCTOR W835
And where was that?

PATIENT W835
CDH of DuPage.

DOCTOR W835
CDH okay.

PATIENT W835
So a DOCTOR the orthopedic surgeon he's kind of backed off it now cause.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
It's been three times it's happened.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
So and I'm still confused.  There was one doctor said it comes from the MRSA.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
The cellulitis is a MRSA.  I never knew that uh, I just thought cellulitis was cellulitis and MRSA was MRSA.

DOCTOR W835
No I, MRSA is a common cause for cellulitis.

PATIENT W835
Oh really?

DOCTOR W835
If you're in the hospital a lot, you can get the hospital-acquired kind and sometimes you hear on the news about like you know outbreaks at schools or something where a lot of students at school, seem to pass that are around each other.

PATIENT W835
So you can get cellulitis in other places besides your legs?

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
Oh.  

DOCTOR W835
Yeah you can get it anywhere and it's not always cellulitis.  Sometimes you get little abscesses.

PATIENT W835
Okay.

DOCTOR W835
Um but I think you in particular are kind of prone to getting.

PATIENT W835
Yeah.

DOCTOR W835
The cellulitis.  Now you're probably colonant to it, meaning that you've got this bacteria that lives in your skin all the time.

PATIENT W835
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W835
Um just like you know because I work in the hospital I probably have it too but.

PATIENT W835
Yeah.

DOCTOR W835
If you have a little break in your skin, something that makes you susceptible it can take hold and it kind of flourishes there.

PATIENT W835
It's probably true because I was putting my wheelchair in the back of my Honda Pilot and taking it out, I was always hitting myself or cutting myself so the VA got me a lift.  So that did away with that anyway @@@ came back.

DOCTOR W835
It came back anyway.

PATIENT W835
But I was wondering maybe the VA would replace the knee.  That's why I went to Orthopedics, see what they said.

DOCTOR W835
Yeah.

PATIENT W835
Cause it is an injury from the service.

DOCTOR W835
Right.

PATIENT W835
So I don't know.

DOCTOR W835
Uh yeah I'd be interested to hear why, you know what exactly is preventing them at CDH. I mean it's that @@@ one person idea once there is infection, @@@.

PATIENT W835
Oh okay.

DOCTOR W835
You know no matter what hospital you go to.

PATIENT W835
Okay.

DOCTOR W835
Um so it may be the right decision that they're making cause you know I mean the last thing we want, as you know, is if there is an infection anywhere.

PATIENT W835
MRSA.

DOCTOR W835
Cause you want, you know a new knee in there and then have it be infected.

PATIENT W835
Yeah I know cause I got a new knee here.

DOCTOR W835
Right.  But I know it's frustrating um.

PATIENT W835
Could I at least go see him though so I can tell those folks at @@@ Medical that they don't think it's a good idea either?

DOCTOR W835
Uh, yeah we'll see if we can get you in their clinic.  Alright um, anything else going on?  Have you been?

PATIENT W835
I been pretty good.

DOCTOR W835
Have you been?

PATIENT W835
Except you know the CO, there you go.

DOCTOR W835
COPD?

PATIENT W835
Yeah.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
I met DOCTOR.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
So he told me not to, well he didn't say not to, he just said why don't you just start coming and see me at the VA?

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
So I been seeing him now.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.  And did they change around any of your medications?

PATIENT W835
No, he thought that was a pretty good idea.  I wish I could see him today cause I've been on tramadol.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
And I need some, I don't know if you can give it to me, some of that uh, what they call it, Nystatin.

DOCTOR W835
Oh are you getting some.

PATIENT W835
Oh gosh.

DOCTOR W835
Stuff on your tongue.

PATIENT W835
Oh they're terrible.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
It's burning like.

DOCTOR W835
So how much prednisone are you taking a day?

PATIENT W835
I've been taking.

DOCTOR W835
I'm sorry (doctor was paged).

PATIENT W835
Oh that's alright.  Uh it's generally 10.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
But he did give me permission, he said you know you're going to have to @@@.  You know I explained to him about how the 10 can really make a difference.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
In your breathing.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
But I have taken 20 on some days.  I was up in Minnesota; I got sick so I was taking 20 for about a week.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.  How recently was that?

PATIENT W835
Uh two weeks ago and then I tapered down to 10.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
Then I did 5's and now I'm back to 10.

DOCTOR W835
Did you do okay on the fives?

PATIENT W835
No, it's like cheating yourself.

DOCTOR W835
Yeah okay.  

PATIENT W835
That's another thing I wanted to ask you doctor.  I'm really a @@@.  They have this commercial for, I think its Sally Field.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
She takes a pill once a month or once every three months for uh bone loss.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
Why won't they give that to men @@@?

DOCTOR W835
Um.

PATIENT W835
She takes that because of that prednisone or is she taking it because of I'm wonder if.

DOCTOR W835
Well it's called, I mean woman are more, get.

PATIENT W835
Oh osteoporosis yeah.

DOCTOR W835
Yeah, although being on prednisone does put you at risk for osteoporosis and other bone problems so I don't see anywhere um that you've had a scan looking for osteoporosis.

PATIENT W835
No I haven't in years.

DOCTOR W835
No.

PATIENT W835
I had one about ten years ago.

DOCTOR W835
Did you?

PATIENT W835
Yeah and they said there was narrowing at the hips or something to do with.  It wasn't here though, it was @@@.

DOCTOR W835
Cause what it's called is a DEXA scan is what we'd be looking at.

PATIENT W835
Yeah it's pretty simple isn't it, just a quick wand and.

DOCTOR W835
Yeah let's see.

PATIENT W835
I was kind of wondering if I could get something like that to see if.

DOCTOR W835
Yeah I think that's reasonable so maybe we can get you set up with that.  Okay.  You're full of good ideas today.  Um okay, so.

PATIENT W835
That must be some pill she takes, cause I thought she said every 90 days.

DOCTOR W835
Yeah there are a variety of different kinds.

PATIENT W835
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W835
So there are some that you take every week, there are some you take every month there are some you take once a year.

PATIENT W835
How does it work, it just boycotts the bone loss somehow?

DOCTOR W835
Right, it kind of freezes the bone and prevents it from uh; it prevents it from breaking itself down.

PATIENT W835
Okay.

DOCTOR W835
Which can happen you know when you're on certain medications or in women who have gone through menopause.  However, it's not good to be on it forever so it's something we kind of use when we need it.

PATIENT W835
Oh okay.

DOCTOR W835
That's why we do the tests, we do the scans, to make sure that someone has osteoporosis so like really true bone loss before um, before we prescribe it.

PATIENT W835
There could be a chance I might not have bone loss, but probably not huh, I don't know.

DOCTOR W835
Well you never know.  How long have you been on the prednisone for?

PATIENT W835
Well I on and off 20-30 years probably yeah.

DOCTOR W835
Alright.  So we'll put in the Nystatin, you like the liquid stuff that you swish around and swallow?

PATIENT W835
Yeah, yeah.  It really relieves that burning.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.  And how often do you use it?  A couple times a day or twice a day.

PATIENT W835
Yes. Uh probably at least once a day but probably twice a day.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
Some of the instructions say you can swallow it.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
One doctor told me don't swallow it, it's not good for the kidneys.

DOCTOR W835
Oh.  Um I'll have to take a look.  You can swish and spit.

PATIENT W835
Okay.  Like in the saloon huh.

DOCTOR W835
Yeah exactly.  Alright do you want to pick it up at the window or have it mailed to you?

PATIENT W835
I'd rather pick it up if I could.  I've got just a teeny bit left.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.  Alright, let's see what else.  

PATIENT W835
I'm also going to try to go upstairs and see if they can give me a shot in the elbow.

DOCTOR W835
Oh yeah it's been helping you right.

PATIENT W835
Oh boy they really help.

DOCTOR W835
Good.  Now are you, did you take a look at the medication list that we printed out for you?

PATIENT W835
Yes.

DOCTOR W835
Well are we missing anything.  There must be more than we've got on here right now.

PATIENT W835
Uh yeah I'm taking something for the prostate uh.  Oh God, let's see what I got.  There was a commercial on television, football is driving me nuts.  I keep going, I keep going, I keep going uh.  I wonder what's the name of that stuff? 

DOCTOR W835
Uh is it Flomax?

PATIENT W835
Yes.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835

DOCTOR W835

And how about, are you on a Fentanyl patch?

PATIENT W835

DOCTOR W835
You are alright.

PATIENT W835
That's the reason why I'd like to get this knee thing done.

DOCTOR W835
Right.

PATIENT W835
But like you said if one set of doctors thinks it's a bad idea.

DOCTOR W835
Yeah.  Alright so you're taking the lisinopril for your blood pressure, what am I missing?  Are you taking a stool softener?

PATIENT W835

Okay.

PATIENT W835
Oh I was taking uh Viagra but Blue Cross, they didn't drop it but they raised it to $50 a pill so.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
That kind of blew me out of the ballpark for that and someone gave me Cialis.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
Which is, I don't see what it does but I have some of that.  That in itself is, Blue Cross will allow you 24 every 50 days.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
And it's 6 or 8 bucks a pill.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
So it's.  I guess it depends on the way you look at it.

Or when you have the colonoscopy, sending those results to us, you know so we don't bother you about it.

PATIENT W835
Okay.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.  And.

PATIENT W835
He did say I had an extra beat but he said it's a generic thing, there's nothing can be done about it, the cardiologist.  He said itâ€™s - an infectious disease doctor and he listened to my heart and he asked me, you better go to Cardiology cause I hear something there, I'm not sure what I'm hearing but.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.

PATIENT W835
Then he explained to me there's nothing we can do or give you for it, it's just.  I think he said there's 30-40 million people have it.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.  Alright.  So I'm going to take your blood pressure again.  It was a little bit high when you first came in.

PATIENT W835

DOCTOR W835
And then you wanted to get it replaced.

PATIENT W835
I don't really want to but it's so, this pain thing is.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
If I could get rid of all that you know.

DOCTOR W835
You get a lot of swelling in your legs?

PATIENT W835
I don't think I get a lot of swelling but theyâ€™re very tender, what is that all about I wonder.

DOCTOR W835
Hmm.

PATIENT W835
It starts at this bone right here.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
This one is, it seems to be.

DOCTOR W835
And this one you have no joint in there right?

PATIENT W835
Right.

DOCTOR W835
They took it out okay.  Okay, alright.  Alright and are you having blood work done somewhere?

PATIENT W835
Uh yes, I just had some done oh well it's been a few months.

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
But, I had that preop done so.

DOCTOR W835
You did okay.

PATIENT W835
And they okayed it so and they did swab the nose for the uh MRSA and it came back okay and.

DOCTOR W835
Okay.  Alright cause there are, you know if, if I were the only doctor taking care of you there are some blood tests that I would want to get just to check up on some routine stuff.

PATIENT W835
Well I'll go for that if you want it @@@.

DOCTOR W835
You would?  Okay, just so we've got it on record and um.

PATIENT W835
Okay.  I think that would be good.

DOCTOR W835
Alright have you eaten anything yet today?

PATIENT W835
No, nothing.  I had a cup of coffee though @@@

DOCTOR W835
Alright.  Did you have like cream and sugar in it?

PATIENT W835

DOCTOR W835
Alright so we'll start and just do a few labs just to have a baseline in our system here.

PATIENT W835
Well thank you, I appreciate that.

DOCTOR W835
Okay and are you still using the CPAP?

PATIENT W835
Oh yes, all the time, that's a lifesaver.

DOCTOR W835

DOCTOR W835
Alright.  So I am going to put in the blood work for today.  I'm gonna put in an order for the DEXA scan just to take a look at bones and look for osteoporosis.

PATIENT W835
Oh thank you.

DOCTOR W835
Um and so, I guess the last thing that we'll need is um, to get a copy of that stress test that you had.

PATIENT W835
Okay.

DOCTOR W835
Cause I can put in for the consult for the orthopedist, they'll contact you about setting up an appointment.

PATIENT W835
Okay.

DOCTOR W835
And you can ask them about a possible knee replacement.  Um they would want us to kind of reassure them that from a cardiac standpoint, from a lung standpoint.

PATIENT W835
Okay.

DOCTOR W835
That you would be okay potentially to even go to surgery so um, so as long as you haven't been told that for some reason your heart wouldn't be able to withstand surgery or your lungs wouldn't be able to.

PATIENT W835
Actually that's why they sent me was to see if I was a good candidate for surgery.

DOCTOR W835
Who sent you?

PATIENT W835
Um DOCTOR my primary.

DOCTOR W835
Oh you mean for the stress test.

PATIENT W835
The cardiologist.

DOCTOR W835
Exactly so.

PATIENT W835
But I should have been doing it every year now uh, I'm not sure, every 18 months.

DOCTOR W835
Oh okay.

PATIENT W835
And thankfully got a new medicine.  They used to have one that I used to think I was gonna die.

DOCTOR W835

DOCTOR W835
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W835
