DOCTOR X026
The verapamil?

PATIENT X026
Is that what that is?  What does that do, I mean what is that?

DOCTOR X026
It's a calcium channel blocker so basically it blocks calcium which seems to aggravate muscles um so there are a bunch of different kinds.  The beta blocker it treats the work of your heart.  The lisinopril is an Ace inhibitor, it works in the kidneys to decrease resistance in your heart but also protects your kidneys.  Most diabetics are on it.  Since your urine and albumin look okay we don't need you to start one right now.

PATIENT X026
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X026
And if that goes high you may need them.

PATIENT X026
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X026
Okay, so I'm actually gonna check a bunch of labs and in February okay.
