PATIENT.

PATIENT T485
PATIENT thank you, okay doc.  

DOCTOR T485
Hi DOCTOR come on back.

PATIENT T485
Yeah I know you guys get in trouble keeping my appointments you know.

DOCTOR T485
Okay, alright, that's good. Alright.  How's everything going today?

PATIENT T485
What was happening @@@ Chicago. I was out in LA for forty years I came back to Chicago 2008 @@@ West LA. 

DOCTOR T485
Okay.

PATIENT T485
So I'm in a slumber house, wake up in the morning and got out of bed and just felt the worst pain that I ever felt in my life.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.

PATIENT T485
Come to find out I had two slipped disks, L4 and L5.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.

PATIENT T485
Back in Chicago I’ve been back since August 2008 and due to my, I had issues with substance abuse.

DOCTOR T485
Right.

PATIENT T485
Uh un stabile lifestyle and I'm gonna, I can be this concise, I can focus but this back is killing me.  I haven't gotten it taken care of yet.

DOCTOR T485
@@@.

PATIENT T485
Now.  I had an MRI and a uh some x-rays at West LA VA before I came home in August 2008.  I don’t know if you can pull that up but here I think I've had at least the x-rays done on the back, but didn't get an MRI at Jesse Brown since I've been back in Chicago and I really want to get this taken care of.  It's really bothering me.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.

PATIENT T485
It's just, I mean the last.

DOCTOR T485
Well it sounds like you have arthritis in your back.

PATIENT T485
You know what, I was @@@.

DOCTOR T485
And um 

PATIENT T485
How did you come to this conclusion?  Did you just, just by your knowledge?

DOCTOR T485
Yeah, yeah just by what you’re telling me.

PATIENT T485
Yeah.  Someone said that I had an x-ray done at a hospital.

DOCTOR T485
You know we could still look.

PATIENT T485
And they said, they pretty much thought it was arthritis too.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.  Well one thing at a time though and we haven't seen you.

PATIENT T485
Exactly.

DOCTOR T485
In a follow-up visit in quite some.

PATIENT T485
Exactly.

DOCTOR T485
So today, let's just kind of get you plugged back into the system.

PATIENT T485
Okay sounds good doc.

DOCTOR T485
Uh it looks like you're on, you know, a number of medications.

PATIENT T485
Quite a list.

DOCTOR T485
For blood pressure, diabetes, asthma uh, probably what we're gonna follow you here in the General Medicine Clinic for.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
What do you take for your blood pressure?

PATIENT T485
I take uh lisinopril.

DOCTOR T485
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T485
I think its 40 mg.

DOCTOR T485
It is.

PATIENT T485
Once a day and metoprolol.  I can't pronounce it.

DOCTOR T485
Metoprolol.

PATIENT T485
Yeah I take, uh I don't how much is the medicine but it should be in the computer on my.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.

PATIENT T485
Yeah.

DOCTOR T485
How about the diabetes?  What are you taking for it?

PATIENT T485
They put me on insulin the last time I was here.  The doctor put me on insulin.

DOCTOR T485
How much do you take?

PATIENT T485
I take 48 of 70/30 NovoLog.

DOCTOR T485
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T485
48 in the morning and 46 at night.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.  Uh and what have your sugars been running?

PATIENT T485
My sugar's been running from like 130 to 160, 170, which is a little high but.

DOCTOR T485
Is that before you eat or after you eat?

PATIENT T485
This is after I eat.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.  What are they usually before you eat?

PATIENT T485
Before I eat they go to 190, 210, 220.

DOCTOR T485
So before you eat the blood sugars are higher?

PATIENT T485
Um, okay let me think about this um.

DOCTOR T485
Do you happen to have blood sugar journal?

PATIENT T485
I didn't bring it with me, I forgot the glucometer, I left that at home.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.

PATIENT T485
But usually the sugars, they're higher before I eat.

DOCTOR T485
It doesn't make any sense.

PATIENT T485
In other words, after I, okay when I test my blood sugar before I take the insulin it's usually high 130, 140, its usually out of the normal range.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.

PATIENT T485
And so I'm testing basically once twice a day is that good or should I be testing more often?

DOCTOR T485
Well it depends how stable they are you know.  If your blood sugars are usually stable then you only need to probably check twice a day.

PATIENT T485
But.

DOCTOR T485
But if they're kind of up and down you should check more than that.

PATIENT T485
Uh okay, so maybe I need to do what uh four times a day?

DOCTOR T485
Well it depends you know.

PATIENT T485
Well they've been running pretty decent.  In other words, I cut back and you know there's some things I know I can do.  I cut back on the cheating.

DOCTOR T485
Hang on. Any episodes of low sugars?

PATIENT T485
No.

DOCTOR T485
Okay, good.  Alright.  Now asthma wise how's your breathing?

PATIENT T485
My breathing has been uh it's been good.  I haven't had an asthma attack in a couple of years.

DOCTOR T485
Uh what are you taking for the asthma?

PATIENT T485
Asthma, I take the steroid inhaler.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.

PATIENT T485
And the Proventil inhaler.  I'm out of my inhaler.

DOCTOR T485
Sure, no problem.

PATIENT T485
Yeah I need some med refills.

DOCTOR T485
Okay we can definitely do that.  Um so like I said you know I was, with this visit, I'd really like to get you plugged back into the system.

PATIENT T485
Okay.  Okay I understand.

DOCTOR T485
Let's establish some you know baseline diabetes labs on your.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
Let's check an average sugar level, let's refill your meds.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
Your blood pressure was very good today and I hope you're very happy about that uh and then we need to do some health maintenance things.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
Uh you're over the age of 50 so you need a colonoscopy.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
To check for colon cancer.

PATIENT T485
Now what does that entail, the colonoscopy?  Is that when they, I know there's a couple of ways they can go but they use the instrument?

DOCTOR T485
Well they take a fiberoptic camera; it's about the size of a pen.

PATIENT T485
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T485
They put it up your bottom.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
Where we know @@@ colon cancer.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
Cause really, it's a very good test, it saves lots of lives.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
So I would recommend it.

PATIENT T485
Okay sure.

DOCTOR T485
Um the other thing is that if you're a diabetic you need an eye exam once a year so I want to schedule you for an eye exam.

PATIENT T485
Yeah I need it, yeah I need it cause I need new glasses anyway.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.

PATIENT T485
So that would be good.

DOCTOR T485
And then uh the third thing is that uh we'll check the cholesterol today so.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
Alright, alright.  Let's just see if there's anything else that we need.  Now this back pain, I’m happy to do an x-ray.  We don't have one in the system so let's do an x-ray to start out with before we jump to an MRI.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
And then we'll go from there.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.  Well if you'll have a seat, let me take a look at you here.  Where you living these days?

PATIENT T485
I'm living in Harvey with my sister.

DOCTOR T485
Okay.

PATIENT T485
On 55th and 3rd on @@@.

DOCTOR T485
@@@ I hear you, I got it.  Alright show me where you're having most of the pain would you say.

PATIENT T485
Right in this lower area here.

DOCTOR T485
Is it worse when you walk or sit or stand?

PATIENT T485
It's um, its worse when I walk.  It's worse when I walk and I had total right hip replacement.

DOCTOR T485
Hmm.

PATIENT T485
In 2008 and 2006.

DOCTOR T485
Some deep breaths, nice deep breaths.  Just breathe normal for me.  Are you able to examine your feet every day?

PATIENT T485
Uh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR T485
Can you take your shoes and socks off so I could see them?  You can sit back down there yeah.  Uh the reason we're so adamant about this is diabetes is the number one cause of amputations in this country.

PATIENT T485
Right.

DOCTOR T485
So it's very important for all diabetics to check their feet every day.

PATIENT T485
Every day.

DOCTOR T485
To be very careful about any kind of ulcers that develop.

PATIENT T485
Alright, you want both of them?

DOCTOR T485
Yeah I want both of them, you gotta check both of them.

PATIENT T485
I don't know, I had to go check it before I came up to see you.  I need some lotion, they're pretty dry.

DOCTOR T485
Well lotion is not as important.  You really just.

PATIENT T485
Check them for sores and.

DOCTOR T485
You gotta make sure that there's no ulcers.  We see, I see tons of diabetics who've lost feet, legs, all that kind of stuff.

PATIENT T485
What causes the amputations?

DOCTOR T485
It's the diabetes.  The high sugar levels.

PATIENT T485
Yes.

DOCTOR T485
Gets into the nerves and it destroys the nerves of the feet.

PATIENT T485
Oh I see okay.

DOCTOR T485
Okay and that's what, people need some amputations.  How's your feeling over here?

PATIENT T485
Oh good.  I was getting a little tingling.

DOCTOR T485
Can you feel this?

PATIENT T485
Yes.

DOCTOR T485
Okay how about this side can you feel this?

PATIENT T485
Yes.

DOCTOR T485
Alright good, good, good, good.  Alright so PATIENT I think that's our plan for today.  We got our work cut out for us.

PATIENT T485
Well I got all the time; whatever you want me to do I'll take care of.

DOCTOR T485
Yeah so we'll schedule you for these tests um and then uh we'll see you back uh you know after all these tests are done and then you know we'll uh you know kind of reconvene, see what they show and go from there.

PATIENT T485
So how long do you think in terms of a return appointment?

DOCTOR T485
Oh let's see, you need a colonoscopy, eye exam, these labs and we'll get the x-ray so it's gonna be, by the time you get all these appointments and the tests are done and back in the computer it's gonna be about a couple of months.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485
So we'll see you probably back in two months.  In the meantime I'll make sure you got enough medicines.

PATIENT T485
Okay.

DOCTOR T485

PATIENT T485
