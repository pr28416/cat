DOCTOR I163
PATIENT?  Hello.

PATIENT I163
How you doing?

DOCTOR I163
Good.  How you doing?

PATIENT I163
Good.  Good as can be.

DOCTOR I163
So it uh seems you've had some action.

PATIENT I163
Oh yeah @@@.

DOCTOR I163
Recently huh.

PATIENT I163
Yeah I had the stones busted up.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah.

PATIENT I163
I must of had them a long time and just never knew it.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah usually you'll have them until they get to a certain size then they you know of course cause you pain.

PATIENT I163
Well the last couple of months, around I don't know how long but uh I would get blood in my urine once in a while, then it'd go away so I didn't pay any attention to it you know and then I went on a trip and I felt real weak and I was having back pains you know and I thought I must have sprained my back or did something you know and then when I got home it really hurt and the rest is history.  I'm still having the problem.  You know when I urinate I still get this burning sensation now I don't know if it's from the stent that's still in there or what and uh I still got this prostate thing driving me nuts.  I have no time to get to the bathroom you know.

DOCTOR I163
You just keep going, going, going?

PATIENT I163
No it's not that, it's when I got to go, I got to go, like I got 15 seconds to find a can somewhere, otherwise I'm whizzing in my pants you know and uh that's starting to be real irritable.  I take those pills, those tomazapins or whatever they are.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
And it seems like they ain’t shrinking them or whatever. I was talking to a friend of mine.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
He was in the Marine Corps and uh he just found out he's got prostate cancer.  He had a removal.

DOCTOR I163
Right.

PATIENT I163
He had it so bad.

DOCTOR I163
Well it doesn't look like you're on anything for your prostate.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.  Terazosin.

DOCTOR I163
The terazosin?

PATIENT I163
Terazosin yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Okay, yeah @@@.  There's another one we can use that actually treats the prostate.

PATIENT I163
@@@.

DOCTOR I163
As far as prostate cancer goes um we've been checking your PSA.

PATIENT I163
Well he told me his PSA was always good and then I don't know what the problem was, it developed into you know a little more and he had cancer throughout his entire prostate and he had it removed, got to take it out you know so I thought the PSA test was.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah, it's rapid.  Even if it's normal, if it increases by, if it doubles.

PATIENT I163
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I163
It's supposed to be normal, let's say it was 1 and then it goes up to 2 then uh you know you get alarmed about it but yours has always been 0.76, you know maybe 0.87 so we're not concerned.

PATIENT I163
No he did tell me that, he was at 1 point something then it shot up to 3.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah even when it's normal it's still a big increase that we'd be concerned.

PATIENT I163
Yeah okay good then I don't have to worry about that.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah and we'll check it again this year.

PATIENT I163
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Um.

PATIENT I163
But uh my uh my big thing is that it's just holding my urine back you know till I get to the bathroom.  Uh sometimes when I do go I've got a very weak flow you know.  Sometimes associated with a little bit of pain you know.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
Cause I got to go so bad  @@@ pants @@@ start to get my drill out and I dribble out a little bit out.

DOCTOR I163
Did they initially put a catheter in there?

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Is that out now?

PATIENT I163
Yeah that was out.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.

PATIENT I163
The catheter was only in there for one day.

DOCTOR I163
For one day okay.

PATIENT I163
And when they took that thing out @@@.

DOCTOR I163
Relief, huh?.

PATIENT I163
I had catheters from before but this one was worse than any of them.  I felt bad for the nurse I started pissing all over the place you know.

DOCTOR I163
How's your sugar doing?

PATIENT I163
Actually I'm gonna tell you, to be honest with you, since I had this kidney stone removal.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
My sugar has dropped down quite a bit.

DOCTOR I163
You check it like in the morning?

PATIENT I163
I check it in the morning and the evening.

DOCTOR I163
What is it usually in the morning?

PATIENT I163
The mornings are a little bit on the high side around 180.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.

PATIENT I163
But the last couple of weeks, since I've had this done the evenings are from anywhere from 70-130 which is pretty good for me.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah, sounds like its pretty good.  Sounds better.

PATIENT I163
Oh yeah, you know especially in the evening before I go to bed I check it I'm in the 120 you know.  Usually in the range of 100-120.  Every so often I'll be at 70 or 80 but, it's a lot better than it was you know months ago.

DOCTOR I163
Good.  Well we checked that test to see where it stands, that hemoglobin A1c.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
That three months tests that we got @@@.

PATIENT I163
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I163
That one, yeah we want less than 7; you got 8.5 the last time.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
So, this is you  here.  When I got to you it was 10.7.  You've got it down to 6.7 which is under 7 but then something, I don’t know what happened but it's coming back up so hopefully now we can get it, get it controlled.

PATIENT I163
Well I already had a bypass surgery.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah.

PATIENT I163
See I've been having a lot of stress like for a while you know.  Basically mainly this year.

DOCTOR I163
Is your daughter living with you?

PATIENT I163
No.  She's moved out.  She got her own place now.

DOCTOR I163
Well.

PATIENT I163
She had lost her job and everything was going bad for her then things started going bad for me you know cause now I got put up with three little kids running around and I mean stuff like that I have no place to hide you know.  Then with the kidney stones you know I have more stress and pain and I think that's my sugar is jumping all over the place.  @@@.

DOCTOR I163
If definitely can be. Um I'm going ask you a question, @@@.  Um.

PATIENT I163
It depends what it is.  @@@.

DOCTOR I163
You need to be truthful with me, you know @@@.  I'm not @@@ or anything but uh you uh you had a urine test.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
In February.

PATIENT I163
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I163
It tested positive for cocaine.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Can you tell me anything about it?  @@@.

PATIENT I163
Yeah, once in a while I do it you know.  I don't even know why, I get together with a couple of guys and you know have a beer or two.

DOCTOR I163
Do you smoke it or snort it?

PATIENT I163
No no I snort it, if I do it at all.  It's just, it don't bother me and once in a while I just do it you know.

DOCTOR I163
The thing is that it tested positive for marijuana too, that's, more okay with that.  Was the cocaine just because you do have the heart you know issues, you know with that past surgery stuff.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Cause a lot of guys, @@@ get a heart attack from the cocaine.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
So I don't want you to @@@ I prefer that you know.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
You really want to uh you know.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Marijuana, that's whatever but the cocaine I would try not to.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Cause I don't want you showing up with a heart attack.  If you weren't you know, you have the heart issues to begin with and you're diabetic and.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
It's not the best you know thing for you.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
As far as, you know you can cause a lot of damage.

PATIENT I163
You know I had been using, I would take it, I just happened to do it that week you know.

DOCTOR I163
Well I appreciate you being honest with me.

PATIENT I163
@@@.  I'm 64 years old.

DOCTOR I163
Right.

PATIENT I163
My lying days are over.  When I was much younger, I have a lot of problems with everything you know.  I got a problem with life, until I found out what my problem was. 

DOCTOR I163
Otherwise your mood is okay, everything is good?

PATIENT I163
Yeah for the most part.  For the most part yeah, especially lately I just was feeling real good you know.

DOCTOR I163
Good.  And uh how much Lantus are you taking now, your insulin?

PATIENT I163
Lantus uh I'm taking like every evening around 25 units.

DOCTOR I163
Okay. 

PATIENT I163
And I'm thinking the way I'm going.

DOCTOR I163
Do you still have some of it?

PATIENT I163
Oh yeah, yeah.  I have one more bottle of it.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.  It looks like somehow @@@ messed up your medications @@@  Otherwise did you take your blood pressure pills this morning?

PATIENT I163
No, I forgot all my medications.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.

PATIENT I163
I was driving halfway here and I had it on the countertop so I wouldn't forget it and I just forgot it.  Normally I take it around 7 a.m. or so.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah your blood pressure.

PATIENT I163
It was a little high yeah.

DOCTOR I163
A little high.  

PATIENT I163
But usually once I take my meds.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
And I check my blood pressure and I'm right on the money.

DOCTOR I163
You're on the money.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.

PATIENT I163
Like I said the sugars at the end of the day, before I go to bed I check it and uh the last couple of weeks I've been very happy with it. The day I went in with the stones @@@.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
Uh I came in and my sugar was like 300.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
Yeah it was real high.  But after they did the stones, I dropped down to 114.

DOCTOR I163
Good.

PATIENT I163
And they couldn't figure out and neither could I you know.  Like maybe @@@ sugar off you know.

DOCTOR I163
You know any stress on the body like you said.

PATIENT I163
Well that's you know, I've been like I said, the last couple of months I've been under a lot of stress and it's been causing a little havoc – my sleep @@@.  @@@ that sleep apnea machine, you know.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
I turned that thing in, I just cannot use it.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.

PATIENT I163
All it does it uh I wake up about two hours after using it and my mouth is so dry it feels like my throat is sticking shut and that’s with the humidifier, I’m using that. @@@ and I've had that thing a long time and I have yet to get a full night's sleep out of it you know.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.

PATIENT I163
So I just kind of brought it back and told them look I can't use this thing.  You know. It does me more damage than good.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
He says well you got to try it for a while.  I said I've had two years or so.

DOCTOR I163
You don't feel like it's worked for you at all?  Have you talked to the breathing people upstairs?

PATIENT I163
Uh I think I talked to them once about it and they said well you got get used it and this and that.  Oh yeah then I was supposed see DOCTOR, the neurologist, what’s her name – a Korean lady @@@.  Yeah.  I don't know but the last time I went to see her I really got pissed off.  I got there; I had a 3:30 appointment, so I get there a little early.  I sat there and I'm watching everybody get up and get served and it's like almost 5 o'clock.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
And there's me and another guy that walked in about 45 minutes you know after me and she calls him and tells me I'm next.  I looked at my watch and I said I'm next, its 5 o'clock already.  I just got pissed off and got up and left you know.

DOCTOR I163
Hmm.

PATIENT I163
I couldn't stand sitting there no more.  I mean I know doctors are busy and they're gonna be late but for Christ's sake I was sitting there for almost two hours and some guy walks in later than me and she takes her in.

DOCTOR I163
Doesn’t make sense.

PATIENT I163
What am I chopped liver?  So I just got up and left and I haven't nothing else.  All I ever do with her is I'm in and out of her office ten minutes but tells me the same thing @@@.  She could have called me up and told me that.

DOCTOR I163
True.

PATIENT I163
But otherwise you know like I said, my biggest beef right now is my prostate that's you know, I've been having trouble with it for quite a while now.  It's starting to get to the point where I got to watch when I go out and how long it takes you know.  Then I got to carry a big milk bottle around in case I got to pee, I just pull over cause I just can't hold it.

DOCTOR I163
Well what does the finasteride do.

PATIENT I163
Huh?

DOCTOR I163
You're on another medication.

PATIENT I163
@@@.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah, yeah.  It's supposed to help shrink your prostate.

PATIENT I163
Yeah cause it's just terrible and like I said the flow in the morning is really @@@.  It's like I’m 90 years old.  But on April 2nd I got to come back for my, for the kidney stones and they're gonna check them out.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
See there was one more big one or one more lodged in my kidney and I guess they couldn't keep on blasting them because the kidney only takes so much but I was checking my urine with the screen and I don't know if passed, the whole passed or not.  I had some good-sized chunks come out.  Boy did that hurt, @@@.

DOCTOR I163
Do you feel like @@@.

PATIENT I163
@@@.  I hang on to the wall and I looked in the mirror while I'm making these animal faces from the pain you know but the pain has subsided a lot.  You know I still have a little bit of burning sensation and I can handle it but I @@@ with the catheter or what you know.

DOCTOR I163
Have you had an eye exam recently?

PATIENT I163
No I'm about due for that.  Yeah it's been over a year now @@@.

DOCTOR I163
And did they any pictures of your eyes or were you actually  seeing a doctor, do you remember?

PATIENT I163
Uh the last time they gave me an eye exam a bunch of malarky about the one eye.  See what happened with my eyes, I had cataracts.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
One doctor worked on my one eye, he was an Oriental doctor, the guy was great.  I mean he got done and I almost had 20/20 vision and I was supposed to get the same thing in the other eye but with the other eye I had another doctor, but the day of surgery he wasn't in so some other guy took over and as far as I’m concerned, he fucked my eyeball up.  Cause I got nothing but trouble with it and one bullshit excuse after another.

DOCTOR I163
Right.

PATIENT I163
Then finding another doctor, reset the lens a little bit and uh that helped a little bit with the little floaters I was seeing but the eye it's still not right, the lens and I guess they tell me there's nothing they can do so.  But I can still see without glasses but my right eye the vision is just a bad if not worse than when it started.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah.

PATIENT I163
And between you and me I'd like to hit that other guy.  Put my finger in his eye.

DOCTOR I163
I think you're due for a colonoscopy too.  I’m just looking. @@@.  You had one in 2005.

PATIENT I163
Was it really that long ago?

DOCTOR I163
Yeah.  Five years ago and you had small polyps it said.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
It was one of those polyps that can grow to cancer but it was small so.

PATIENT I163
Well I know they removed it.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah they removed it but uh, I think we need to get it done again.

PATIENT I163
Okay.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.

PATIENT I163
That's always a lot of fun.

DOCTOR I163
You like that don't you?

PATIENT I163
Oh yeah I love it.  It’s like the story of the lawyer and the man another guy was sitting there in a steam bath @@@ and @@@ finally one day I said hey what kind of work you do.  @@@ I'm a lawyer and @@@ no kidding.  Wow that's interesting, let me tell you what kind of lawyer are you? And he goes, I’m a civil lawyer. @@@  So what kind of job you doing?  The guy goes I'm a magician and the other guy goes what, a magician.  He says I’ve loved magic since I was a kid. I love magic. Do a magic trick @@@ well it's kind of hard because I don’t have my cape, my cane, my top hat @@@ and the lawyer being a lawyer says oh yeah, he says if you were a real magician you would do me a trick. He says, Okay, I got one. Stand up and now bend over, so the lawyer bend over and he says now can you feel my thumb in your ass and the lawyer goes yeah and he goes da da.

DOCTOR I163
I've never heard that one.  @@@.  If you don't mind stepping up here.  I like your shoes are they new?

PATIENT I163
You know I buy these at a wholesale place called Havana; I got them out of the VFW Magazine.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
These were $29 bucks.

DOCTOR I163
They look pretty good.

PATIENT I163
Yeah and they've got pants.  They've got clothes half of what I was paying for all the time.

DOCTOR I163
@@@.

PATIENT I163
I mean like these pants.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
You know knock arounds.  They were cheap, I bought a couple pair of these and then the shoes, they're all like Dr. Scholls, they’re all good shoes.

DOCTOR I163
Comfortable?

PATIENT I163
Yeah comfortable.  In fact I get more comfort out of these than I do when I go to the shoe store.  It seems like everything in the shoe store is tight, stiff.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah it doesn't. It takes a while to get used to it.

PATIENT I163
Like a Chinese lawyer.

DOCTOR I163
Say @@@.  Take a deep breath.  Let it out, again.  Again and again.  Have you @@@.

PATIENT I163
You know what else I was going to tell you.

DOCTOR I163
Yeah.  

PATIENT I163
It seems like I'm having a lot of trouble with my legs.  Like if I sit a while.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
And when I get up and try to walk.

DOCTOR I163
@@@.

PATIENT I163
No just achy, real painful like you know.  But I know when I was in the military I got hit in the back and uh it's nothing that really bothered me a whole helluva lot but up until, I'd say the last couple of years, one or two years, once I got a job @@@ why it's like I get up and just getting up it feels like I'm really straining though.

DOCTOR I163
Where does it hurt?  You don't feel hip?

PATIENT I163
No in the thighs.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.

PATIENT I163
On this one side it hurts @@@.

DOCTOR I163
Right.  And you don't have any numbness or tingling?

PATIENT I163
No.  It feels like a @@@ and I do exercises and stuff.  Once I start moving around it’s fine.

DOCTOR I163
Are you still swimming?

PATIENT I163
I haven't been because of the kidney thing.

DOCTOR I163
Right.

PATIENT I163
I don’t want to go in the pool. @@@

DOCTOR I163
Any blood in your stool or black stools?

PATIENT I163
No.

DOCTOR I163
Can I have you take your shoes and socks off so I can check your feet?

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
You keep good care of your feet?

PATIENT I163
Yeah I uh, you know I scrub them good.  My wife bought me special skin lotion for diabetics.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
You know for the feet.

DOCTOR I163
Right.

PATIENT I163
So I use that.

DOCTOR I163
I'm gonna do this test where it's going to feel kind of funny.  You tell me when you feel it okay.

PATIENT I163
Okay.

DOCTOR I163
You say yes.  

PATIENT I163
Yeah I felt it it's like a bump.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.

PATIENT I163

DOCTOR I163
You feel all these.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Okay.  Tell me whenever you feel it.

PATIENT I163
Yeah, yeah uh I can feel it a little bit yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Okay good.  You haven't lost any of your, tend to get nerve problems from your diabetes.

PATIENT I163
Yeah.

DOCTOR I163
Any circulation problems in your feet that uh.

PATIENT I163
I do notice though on occasions uh my feet get a little sweaty.

DOCTOR I163
Sweaty?

PATIENT I163
Real sweaty.

DOCTOR I163
Let me give you a hand there.

PATIENT I163
Either sweaty or real cold.

DOCTOR I163
You can put your shoes and socks back on.  I want to talk about your case with the other doctor.

PATIENT I163
Okay.

DOCTOR I163
Um otherwise did they tell you what kind of stones they were?

PATIENT I163
No.  Well I don't think they uh, I don't know.  I have no idea what kind of stones they were.

DOCTOR I163
It was a uric acid stone.

PATIENT I163
What does that mean?

DOCTOR I163
Um well it uh, it's uric acid stones.  Uric acid, you've never had gout before?

PATIENT I163
No.

DOCTOR I163
No.  It happens when you have uh a high level of uric acid in your blood.  When you have high uric acid sometimes you can get gout, sometimes you can get stones.  You haven't had gout before.

PATIENT I163
No.

DOCTOR I163
But it's pretty painful.

PATIENT I163
I know what gout is.

DOCTOR I163
In your big toe and stuff uh so we can think about putting you on a pill that decreases that level and this is not the first time you've had stones is it?

PATIENT I163
Well actually yeah this is the first time I ever got treated for them.

DOCTOR I163
Treated for them but you've had them for a long time.

PATIENT I163
I was just amazed, uh surmising I guess you know.  I really don't know.  I always get pain in the back for years but I always thought you know I worked construction and I worked pretty hard my whole life

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
I just figured I twisted a muscle or something you know and I never thought about stones at all.

DOCTOR I163
Stones are.

PATIENT I163
Cause my wife had them and the pain she was going through was something else and I didn't have that pain.  Like I said a couple of times I'd say the last few I've had blood in my urine.  I mean not real heavy.

DOCTOR I163
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I163
You know I noticed the color had changed.

DOCTOR I163
Right.

PATIENT I163
But that kind of cleared up so I never paid attention to it.  As far as the real serious pain I didn't have up until January and then I didn't know what it was.

DOCTOR I163
Well I'll be back okay.

PATIENT I163
Okay.  I'll be fine, I won’t hurt myself nor nuthin.

(DOCTOR OUT:  45:05  DOCTOR IN:  60:51)

DOCTOR I163
You want to try something?

PATIENT I163
I got to do something because it's like it's the only thing it's good for is pissing you know and I went from like uh, like I said I was very very active and now it's just that it's like I'm just a a log sitting there you know and I don't know what to use or what to take because of all the meds I take I don't want to to take something that will counteract something else.

DOCTOR I163
