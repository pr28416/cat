DOCTOR N416
PATIENT?

PATIENT N416
Yes.  @@@.

DOCTOR N416
Have a seat.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
Is this your first visit here?

PATIENT N416
Yes.

DOCTOR N416
Blue Clinic.  Alright, let's see.  You've been to the ER, when was the last time?

PATIENT N416
I've been twice.

DOCTOR N416
Twice huh.

PATIENT N416
The first one was for chest pain.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
And then the second one, I'd had a headache for four days and it turned out was a severe sinus infection.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  Did they give you treatment for that?

PATIENT N416
Yes I'm taking uh antibiotics.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  Are you feeling better?  Is your headache feeling better?

PATIENT N416
Yeah the headache is gone actually.

DOCTOR N416
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N416
Uh you know I haven't, I haven't been able to really breathe out of my nose for the last ten years.

DOCTOR N416
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N416
And I've been to doctors uh and all they said was well you've got a sinus infection, they would give me antibiotic and no one would ever follow up including myself.

DOCTOR N416
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N416
And I just wanted.

(Knock on the door, doctor speaks with other person)

DOCTOR N416
Sorry.

PATIENT N416
No that's okay.  To make a long story short I haven't been able to breathe, really breathe or smell for almost the last ten years.

DOCTOR N416
Oh.

PATIENT N416
I've been basically mouth-breather for those years and uh the doctor was so great.  I mean I'm starting to smell again, stuff I haven't smelled for years.

DOCTOR N416
Oh really.  So you've been using a spray, that type of thing.

PATIENT N416
Yeah.

DOCTOR N416
@@@.  Alright.  Yeah so that's good.  So they just told you then, you of course you are going to complete those antibiotics?

PATIENT N416
Yes.

DOCTOR N416
But after that the sprays you are supposed to keep doing, so don’t stop them. And if they’re helping you, that’s great. Um the clindamycin, did they give you, how many days did you use do you think?

PATIENT N416
They gave me a bottle about this big.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
I usually take 12 a day so.

DOCTOR N416
Right.  Okay.  But yeah the fluticasone @@@ fair enough.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
Okay and that should help drain things in the long run and the @@@ so long. 

PATIENT N416
And it got to the point where my gums were swollen and I think they're starting to recede now.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
But over the summer, it had gotten to the point where I mean you could barely see my front teeth on the top.

DOCTOR N416
Yeah.

PATIENT N416
Because the gums were really bad.

DOCTOR N416
Yeah.  And uh I see that you had a chest x-ray I'm just trying to see what the results were.

PATIENT N416
Yeah you now they called my house and gave it to my wife.  They told my wife something but I'm confused with what they told her or maybe she's confused as to what she heard.

DOCTOR N416
@@@.

PATIENT N416
Um and I haven't been able to get hold of anybody to call me back.  Basically what I get out of my wife's message was that they found uh some type of irregularity but it's no big deal basically is what she said.  Um but I'm thinking if there's anything @@@ that's a big deal to me.

DOCTOR N416
Yeah, let me see what you might have. @@@ almost seven minutes. What stopped you? You got tired?  

PATIENT N416
From the stress test?

DOCTOR N416
Yeah.

PATIENT N416
They just said, “Okay bring him down.” You know, I don't know.

DOCTOR N416
You were tired?

PATIENT N416
You know I work nights.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
I work all night from midnight to 8.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
So, I had just come from working and my legs were about to give out I just didn’t.

DOCTOR N416
Well the good news is that you actually had a normal stress test.
 
PATIENT N416
Okay.  

DOCTOR N416
That's @@@ and I'm not sure what the abnormality they were talking about but there is a something @@@ indicating what they call poor R wave progression.

PATIENT N416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N416
And uh @@@ that's probably what they @@@.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
So what's causing my chest pains?

DOCTOR N416
So let's talk about that.  Why don't you tell me about um, well first of all let me, there are some questions I need to ask you.

PATIENT N416
Sure, sure.

DOCTOR N416
@@@ questionnaire @@@ a little background.

PATIENT N416
Yeah are  you going to be my, uh.

DOCTOR N416
So I'll be your primary care, but unfortunately I'm graduating in June so as long as @@@.

PATIENT N416
That's okay because I haven't really seen a doctor as far as a primary care physician in about 18 years.

DOCTOR N416
So let's get you established here and then DOCTOR will be your, he's going to be my supervisor and he'll be here.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
And he expects to be here.  Tell me about your past medical history, what else do you have?

PATIENT N416
Uh allergic to penicillin.  Um I had bronchiolitis as an infant.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
I had my appendix taken out uh.

DOCTOR N416
How long ago?  How long?

PATIENT N416
It was in 99.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
98, right around there, about ten years ago.  Um I've had two maybe three bouts of kidney stones.  I know the first one they did the fluids and they sent me on my way and that kind of helped a little bit but the second time I had to have the surgery.

DOCTOR N416
Oh okay.  Where they like they busted it up or did they have to go in?

PATIENT N416
No they had to go in.

DOCTOR N416
Alright.  

PATIENT N416
Um I've got two bulging disks in my back, L4-L5 and those are from about 1987-88.

DOCTOR N416
Did they do anything?

PATIENT N416
The doctor didn't want to do; the doctor I was seeing at the time did not want to do surgery.  He did not believe in surgery for any of that so he just basically gave me anti-inflammatories.

DOCTOR N416
And then uh.

PATIENT N416
I was out of work for like three months.

DOCTOR N416
Because of the low back pain?

PATIENT N416
Yes.

DOCTOR N416
So you had the kidney stones.  Any blood pressure?

PATIENT N416
The last time, no not the last time but as far back as I can remember it's been borderline.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
Uh I was told to watch your weight you could bring it down.  Uh from when I first come in with the stress test to when you took it today it's gone down quite a bit.

DOCTOR N416
Okay and you’re not on any medications right?

PATIENT N416
For that, no.  

DOCTOR N416
Do you have anxiety?

PATIENT N416
Yeah.  Seems to @@@ for that.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
And another thing is the weight gain.  The last four months I've put on an average of about nine pounds a month.

DOCTOR N416
That.

PATIENT N416
I was going to talk to somebody today or I was gonna talk to you is I can get the note.  I want to go to the gym but if it's too taxing, if you could give me a little kick start or something with some water pills or uh a diuretic or something I mean.

DOCTOR N416
You know mostly @@@ and that might not be the appropriate thing to do.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  So let's uh, I'll kind of talk to you a little bit more about that.  Let's see so you're past medical, you said you had the borderline hypertension, you had L4-L5 disk, you've had the kidney stones, you had the appendectomy and um any kind of cholesterol problems, nothing like that?

PATIENT N416
No, no.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  @@@?

PATIENT N416
No.

DOCTOR N416
And you told me @@@.  You've had any surgeries?

PATIENT N416
Surgeries I've only had those two.

DOCTOR N416
And then uh do you work now?

PATIENT N416
Yeah it's about 30 hours a week.

DOCTOR N416
What do you do?

PATIENT N416
I'm a driver for a bakery.

DOCTOR N416
And uh what’s your living situation, who do you live with?

PATIENT N416
Uh with my wife and children.

DOCTOR N416
How many.

PATIENT N416
@@@.

DOCTOR N416
Three kids.

PATIENT N416
Three kids.  Three kids and if you want to count a grandchild, four.

DOCTOR N416
They count too.

PATIENT N416
Yeah.

DOCTOR N416
And do you smoke at all?

PATIENT N416
No.

DOCTOR N416
Uh drink?

PATIENT N416
I'm an occasional drinker.  I'll drink, like two or three drinks at Christmas, a drink or two at New Year's and maybe you know at the family picnic I'll have a couple of beers.  It's not really.  If I do have drinks it's never more than two or three at a time.

DOCTOR N416
And you haven't done any drug use?

PATIENT N416
In the past yeah.

DOCTOR N416
Like what'd you use?

PATIENT N416
Uh marijuana was about 1982 that I stopped.  Also did some amphetamines back then and I think I stopped in the 80s.  Uh I've done cocaine in the past.

DOCTOR N416
When was the last?

PATIENT N416
Uh it's been a while.

DOCTOR N416
How often was that?

PATIENT N416
90s.

DOCTOR N416
And then @@@.

PATIENT N416
Yes.

DOCTOR N416
Any family history of illnesses or anything?

PATIENT N416
Well my mother passed away of lymphoma uh back in September but that was, she was taking some medicine uh Humira and one of the side effects was that it could cause lymphoma.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
So when they found out she was already in the late stage for it.  Uh my dad passed away um in 2001 um, oh it's the one where it attacks your bones um I can't think of the name, it's weird.  It basically turns your bones porous um I forget the name of it now.  

DOCTOR N416
Osteoporosis?

PATIENT N416
No.

DOCTOR N416
@@@.

PATIENT N416
Uh I can't remember the name but it was something that again that.

DOCTOR N416
@@@ was it a cancer or something?

PATIENT N416
Yeah it was a type of cancer, he was taking chemo and stuff like that and I don't remember the name now but uh it's never been in our family history.  We believe he contracted that at work.  He was working with shrink wrap, when they do shrink wrap and uh there was no ventilation in the.

DOCTOR N416
How old was he?

PATIENT N416
74.

DOCTOR N416
And it wasn't @@@.

PATIENT N416
No.  Basically he had a stroke but it was all, all uh.

DOCTOR N416
Any um any heart disease in the family?

PATIENT N416
Uh on my mother's side longevity, I mean there's a lot of longevity.  I mean I've got an aunt now who is in her 90s.  My grandmother died at 108.  Um nothing on that side.

DOCTOR N416
No diabetes?

PATIENT N416
No uh well, I got a cousin that had it but you know I don't keep much in touch with him.  I think it's because of his weight, he's up there.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  And uh let's go back to you then. I need to ask, you were telling me how do you feel today actually?  Any concerns you want to bring up today or just kind of establish care and talk about these things.

PATIENT N416
Just wanted to establish care and the follow-up today.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  And your chest pain, what was happening when the chest pain.

PATIENT N416
I was getting the chest pain right here.

DOCTOR N416
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N416
And sometimes it will shoot into my armpit and sometimes it would shoot into my back.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
Um and you know for a couple of weeks before that I would, my hands would go numb right from the elbow to the fingertips.

DOCTOR N416
Oh is that right.

PATIENT N416
If I'm in a certain position, let's say I'm driving and my arm's this way it would do it and then I'd have to either lower my arm.

DOCTOR N416
If you lowered it, it would go away.

PATIENT N416
Yeah it would be fine or if I'd sit you know and I'd put my hand like this.

DOCTOR N416
Right.

PATIENT N416
Then it would go numb.  Uh.

DOCTOR N416
That was only for those two weeks?

PATIENT N416
Uh for about two weeks beforehand and then once I started having those pains it would still do it during those while I was having the chest pain but after that, excuse me I'm fine now.

DOCTOR N416
You haven’t had it...

PATIENT N416
I haven’t had it since.

DOCTOR N416
So the chest pain went it came on, was it like a pressure sensation?

PATIENT N416
No it was a sharp pain, sharp pain.

DOCTOR N416
Left side you said.

PATIENT N416
Yes.

DOCTOR N416
Do you get any shortness of breath with it?

PATIENT N416
Yes.

DOCTOR N416
Any nausea or vomiting when you have it?

PATIENT N416
No vomiting uh I think once or twice I had a little bit of nausea, nothing major.

DOCTOR N416
Any dizziness?

PATIENT N416
@@@.

DOCTOR N416
Did it seem like your heart was racing or anything?

PATIENT N416
Uh, once or twice I felt it was pumping really hard and it almost felt like it was an irregular heartbeat or something.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
Uh but it didn't last long.  Uh I didn't, I was so freaked out about it when it happened that uh I really didn't focus on I mean my heartbeat or anything like that, I was more freaked out than anything.

DOCTOR N416
I gotcha.  And then any sweats or anything?

PATIENT N416
No.

DOCTOR N416
And then how long would you say that @@@?

PATIENT N416
Uh, within five minutes, sometimes half an hour.

DOCTOR N416
Five minutes to half an hour.

PATIENT N416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N416
And uh how many were you having.

PATIENT N416
Uh I had pains for about a week uh sometimes it was; when I was alone it would be like one time a day otherwise it would be a bunch of them every day.

DOCTOR N416
So it varies.

PATIENT N416
Yes.

DOCTOR N416
@@@ Have you felt better since you left the ER @@@.  

PATIENT N416
Um I was having just a tinge uh yesterday, just like a little you know just kind of a little minor, it’s there. Um but really right after the stress test I think,  once or twice more I think I had them and that was it.

DOCTOR N416
After you just go out and walk around do you have any trouble breathing at all?

PATIENT N416
No um.  Right after, right after when I started walking when the weather was still good.

DOCTOR N416
Right.

PATIENT N416
Before this cold snap, I was trying to walk about a mile and a half, two miles a day.  Um for the first two days I'd walk about a mile, mile and a half and I was kind like out of breath and hurting but at the end of the week I was walking two miles um at a good pace with no problems.

DOCTOR N416
@@@ all about your conditioning.

PATIENT N416
Yeah.

DOCTOR N416
Did you get that chest pain after you walked?

PATIENT N416
No.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  And then @@@ any fevers or chills right now?

PATIENT N416
No, not right now.

DOCTOR N416
And uh any nausea or vomiting?

PATIENT N416
No.

DOCTOR N416
And any abdominal pain?

PATIENT N416
Yes but I think it's a byproduct of the medicine I'm taking.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
The uh antibiotics cause diarrhea.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  So you're @@@.  What color is it?

PATIENT N416
What color @@@?

DOCTOR N416
@@@.  Does it have @@@ odor to it?  @@@.

PATIENT N416
Uh it's different than usual yeah.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  That started on the same day or?

PATIENT N416
Yeah pretty much or half a day after, 10 hours after or a couple hours after.

DOCTOR N416
Clindamycin can cause diarrhea as a side effect.  That can also cause like a bacterial super infection.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
So that's something to watch out for.  This sounds more like the diarrhea is a side effect from the antibiotic and not the other one.

PATIENT N416
Hmm.

DOCTOR N416
@@@ you're having a lot of this diarrhea, you find you get fevers and chills I think you should come @@@.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
And then uh having the runny nose.

PATIENT N416
It's not uh, it's never been runny, it's just stuffy uh but it's been a lot better.

DOCTOR N416
@@@.  Any dizziness?

PATIENT N416
Um no not really.

DOCTOR N416
And then any chest pain right now?

PATIENT N416
Not right now.  I had a little bit last night.

DOCTOR N416
It was the same thing that you were talking about?

PATIENT N416
Yeah but not as strong and it didn't last as long and that's basically the first time I felt it and a couple of days but before it was happening every day.

DOCTOR N416
Any swelling or redness of your legs?

PATIENT N416
Um it's hard to tell with all this weight gain.  I mean I'm gaining weight so fast uh no nothing out of the ordinary.

DOCTOR N416
And when you've been gaining weight over how long?

PATIENT N416
Um from October to now I've put on about 40 pounds.

DOCTOR N416
Why do you think that is?

PATIENT N416
I don't know uh well I mean I've been at the job doing what I'm doing now since March.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
Uh and I don't know what it is from uh October to now I don't know why all of a sudden a big weight gain.  I was pretty much steady.  I've always been between 205 and 220, pretty much my entire adult life.

DOCTOR N416
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N416
Ever since I got out of the military uh and it's just ballooned.  I'm not eating as much.  I only eat basically two meals a day um but I mean it gets winter and I'm not getting out and doing as much but.

DOCTOR N416
Any swollen @@@ they’re hot and you’re cold.

PATIENT N416
I'm usually the other way around.  Usually I always drive with the windows @@@ open.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  Any problems with urination?

PATIENT N416
No.

DOCTOR N416
Any problems breathing?

PATIENT N416
Uh, right since I've been here yeah, I'm getting a little more stuffy but I've been really, really good since.

DOCTOR N416
@@@.  You're not wheezing or anything like that?

PATIENT N416
No.

DOCTOR N416
@@@.

PATIENT N416
Yeah.

DOCTOR N416
Well let's see, let me see what lab tests @@@.  Your blood work looks pretty good. @@@.  Yeah I think we need to check your cholesterol and that's up there pretty high.  It's high but for someone with no risk factors we definitely not horrendous.  So we might want to try to get that down with the weight loss start with that and see if it helps okay.  We'll have to talk a little more about that, what we may want to do is check a couple more labs.

PATIENT N416
And I wanted to ask when I came in this time with the headaches.

DOCTOR N416
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N416
The sinus infection my wife suggested I ask the doctor @@@ cause when I come in for any type of blood work I do have them checked.

DOCTOR N416
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N416
@@@.

DOCTOR N416
Is that hepatitis B?

PATIENT N416
She has C and @@@.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  Uh, yeah we don't have any C here, the tests are hepatitis B and that one you don't have.  But if you want we can @@@, you want the test?  @@@.  The one thing to worry about with weight gain sometimes is your thyroid.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
@@@.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
And see if everything is normal.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
Let me have you sit up here and I'll listen to your chest.

PATIENT N416
You want the sweatshirt off?

DOCTOR N416
I'll have you pull it up if that's okay.  @@@.  Say ah.

PATIENT N416
Ah.

DOCTOR N416
@@@ started this treatment @@@.

PATIENT N416
Yes.

DOCTOR N416
Take a deep breath for me.  @@@.  Push against me now, good.  Can you look up for me, lean back good?  Now can you @@@.  @@@.  Close your eyes @@@.  Good.  @@@.  You still getting that numbness and tingling in here?

PATIENT N416
Uh-huh, @@@.

DOCTOR N416
@@@.  

PATIENT N416
No.

DOCTOR N416
Okay @@@.  Can you do this for me?  Any problems?  @@@.  Any problem with this?

PATIENT N416
Uh uh.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  Let me go talk to my supervisor @@@ and uh we just need to @@@ okay.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
Now one thing I should tell you about is the MOVE Program and we'll probably recommend that anyway, that's obviously what we do.  That's kind of the local gym here and we help you out with @@@.

PATIENT N416
Well I was looking at joining a gym.  I mean I'm really uh, I've been really, really, really worried about my weight.

DOCTOR N416
Yeah.

PATIENT N416
Um and I was even looking to you know like find a gym.  I think there's one on 18th street close to my house.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
Um I really, I've been trying to talk my daughter into and I think she's finally agreed to join with me but if I could do that here that’s fine too.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.  I'll see if that helps you out.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
I'll be right back.

PATIENT N416
Uh-huh.  Uh one other question um now this is probably due to age but within the last year my eyes have really been getting bad.  I was wondering if I could @@@.

DOCTOR N416
I could put in for an eye appointment okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  64:45  DOCTOR IN:  73:12)

DOCTOR N416
Alright.  So we were talking about it.  I think what we'll do is the you know some of the things that we talked about causing the weight gain.

PATIENT N416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N416
Things to worry about would be the thyroid or adrenal problems.  Uh @@@ some sort of @@@ for labs for @@@ and then your thyroid function studies @@@.  What I think you could do is uh like I said we can try that MOVE Program.  @@@ weight gain @@@.  That would be more @@@ okay.  So we'll do that.  We'll send you to the MOVE Program and then we'll see you start losing weight and we'll have you come back and we'll check it @@@ every week, make sure you're checking your weight and then we'll have you come back in a month to see if there's any change at all okay.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
I also want to check up on your @@@ so that's why we'll have you come back.  

PATIENT N416
Where is this gym located.

DOCTOR N416
Yeah so the MOVE Program, the nice thing about it is it's not just a gym but you'll have someone that works with you there to recommend exercises and there’s an intake nurse @@@ do that right now @@@ just before we do that I do also want to get some stool studies from you.  That diarrhea that you're having, even though it just started and it could be directly from the antibiotic but @@@ I was telling you about it could be the other part of it. Let’s make sure that’s not what it is.

PATIENT N416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N416
‘Cuz if that’s the case, we’ll put you on another antibiotics.  Okay.

PATIENT N416
Do you just want to know the color or I mean.

DOCTOR N416
No, no, what they do is they check it for that bacteria.  Okay.  My feeling is that it’s going to be negative.  But if it is positive then we'll put you on something different.  Is this the right number to call you at, NUMBER.

PATIENT N416
No I changed it.  NUMBER.

DOCTOR N416
@@@ if that other number doesn’t exist @@@  Alright let's take you over to.

PATIENT N416
Leave my stuff here?

DOCTOR N416
Uh no let's take it with you, @@@.

PATIENT N416
Leave from here?

DOCTOR N416
Yeah.  I'll give you that.  Okay on the way out just check out and they'll give you an appointment for one month from now.

PATIENT N416
Okay.

DOCTOR N416
Okay.

PATIENT N416
Do you know where this MOVE Program is?

DOCTOR N416
