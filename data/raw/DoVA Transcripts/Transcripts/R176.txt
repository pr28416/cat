PATIENT R176
Just once.

DOCTOR R176
Just once a day?

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R176
So you've just been taking two pills a day basically?

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R176
Alright give me one second I'm just gonna review the, probably look at the x-ray myself okay.

PATIENT R176
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  10:00  DOCTOR IN:  17:46)

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Sorry about that.

PATIENT R176
NAME.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Yeah no, no, I think it's @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR R176
Alright you're gonna get that done.  We definitely want to do that.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Yeah sorry about that.  Um so the x-rays.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
The x-rays that we got when I saw you in Urgent Care it showed evidence of osteoarthritis.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Have you heard of that before?  So there's two kinds of arthritis, well this actually well several different kinds of arthritis um but the two that everyone knows is rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.

PATIENT R176
Hmm.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Osteoarthritis is the one that you have and it's basically wear and tear.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You know as you get older.  Anyone who lives long enough is probably going to have osteoarthritis in one or more of their joints and you know you got two bones against each other over 65 years and you know.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Kind of wears down so.  Um what you see typically on the x-rays is you know the bones are like this you know.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And with osteoarthritis you see narrowing so the bones get a little bit closer. 

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Sometimes they have um, you see degrading of the surface you know.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And so that's what they saw in both of the knees.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
@@@ so the question is what do you do about it?  Um several things you can do um you can do, well the first thing you try to do is just control the pain with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen.  Then what you can also, you know, going up from that or you know if you're not getting enough pain control then you go with other things.  You know there are different medicines and you can also do injections, injections of the joint with um a steroid.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And that kind of lowers the inflammation and it usually helps with the pain.  Um patients who get that usually get pain relief for a month or two and they have to come you know several times a year to get re-injected and then after that um you know there's other things that you can go on and then there are other things that you can do to kind of help with the pain.  You can strengthen the muscles around the joint uh mainly you know the leg muscles you've got here um.  So you know there's things that we can do.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um but unfortunately all of the things that we do don't really cure it.

PATIENT R176
No.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
There really is no cure I mean it's hard to cure you know worn down knees.

PATIENT R176
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
So um you know everything that we, you know the treatments that we offer are basically controlling the pain, trying to minimize further damage to the joint and so on okay.  So you I mean, I saw you two weeks ago, right.

PATIENT R176
Right uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um yeah and you said it's been getting worse in the last few years um and I started you on some ibuprofen.  So how do you feel?  I mean is the pain better than it was when I first saw you?

PATIENT R176
Well it's I can walk and do everything.  It's not like if I'm sitting here and I ain't having no problem getting up because it seem like it tightens up.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Tightens up.

PATIENT R176
Yeah like that.  As long as I'm walking and everything - tolerable.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Uh-huh good.  You know and you're only taking, when do you take the ibuprofen that I prescribed?  You're just taking it once a day you said right?  Take two tablets once a day?

PATIENT R176
When I get ready to go to work.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Okay and what do you do?  Do you work nights or?

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You work nights?

PATIENT R176
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
So you, you know take it in the evening basically before you go to work.

PATIENT R176
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
It gets you through the.

PATIENT R176
Yeah, the whole night, right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
All night.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Okay.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And then you get home and it hurts.

PATIENT R176
It hurt all day anyway but uh it just eases the pain that's all.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Uh-huh.  The other thing we can do, so you can take you know you're taking, they say that the safe amount.  You know with every medicine there's a limit as to how much you can take.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um the medicine that you're taking is 2.4 mg.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Give or take and you're taking 600 or so and you can take about four of those tablets a day.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh but I ain't taking nowhere close to that.  

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Yeah and the other thing that you know what you can do is you can take it more often so what I was just thinking another option would be right now you've got I gave you the prescription for the 600.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
We can do 800 which is a little bit higher of a dose.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And you can do that like three times a day.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You know so that way it's like, you know you get it before you go to work and then you know you can take it when you get home from work you know, so you'd be kind of like spacing it out.

PATIENT R176
Right, right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You know what I'm saying um that could be another option.  I mean I guess I'm trying to get a sense of what your, what your thoughts are.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
If it's just pain that.

PATIENT R176
No it's not a boom, stopping me from doing anything.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R176
It's just, it's there.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
It's there.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
How and like 0-10 what would you think it would be?

PATIENT R176
Before the medicine, before the ibuprofen it was about a 8.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And now?

PATIENT R176
When I take it it's good.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You have no pain when you take it?

PATIENT R176
Oh I have pain all the time regardless if I take it or not.  It's just not as pronounced when I take it.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
So you were an 8 before.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And then what does it bring it down to?

PATIENT R176
It come on down to about a 6 or something like that you know.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R176
Cause Iâ€™m constantly walking all night.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Well the other thing I mean we can give you something else too you know um.  Six you know I, there's different, you know everyone's different but the ideal is to get it down to about a 4.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Okay uh so what we can do and I'm just looking at your labs.  We checked all your labs in February.  Checked your livers, kidneys, all that looks good so.  Um yeah I think we should add something, you know like a different type of medicine so um we'll try that.  Does that sound okay?

PATIENT R176
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um you know no one likes to take more pills but this is something that you would take as needed.

PATIENT R176
Hmm, okay.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um the medicine that you're on you've been taking.  Are you still taking the tramadol?

PATIENT R176
What is that one?

FIRST DOCTOR R176

PATIENT R176
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um which is, it's actually incidentally the same medicine that I would.  It's a different type of pain medicine so you have ibuprofen and tramadol but they're different types of pain medicine and they work differently.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um you know if you give someone two of the same types of pain medicine you're kind of not doing much, you might as well just give them more of the original medicine.

PATIENT R176
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Yeah this is what I would do had you not been on it.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And you've already got a prescription for it; you probably don't have any at home right?

PATIENT R176
No.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Which affects heart disease.

PATIENT R176
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Vascular disease as well as like brain, strokes, puts you at risk for that sort of thing um you want to stay away from foods that are high in salt.

PATIENT R176

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And then you know the fried foods.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Uh red meat.  You know no one's saying you have to become a monk.

PATIENT R176
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um you know try to stay away from foods like prepared foods.  Anything in a can, anything in a box.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Chances are, itâ€™s going to have high salt because salt is a preservative.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You know we've been using salt to preserve food for thousands of years.

PATIENT R176
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You know and we still use it um so like canned food, food that comes in a box that sort of thing.  Those things tend to have a lot of salt.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
So you know instead of eating like canned vegetables, you know whenever possible try to eat fresh or frozen vegetables.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Things like that.

PATIENT R176
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um you know those are things that you can do with your diet.

Um even though you're not too bad you're still not where we want you to be.  You know you're at 143/70 today and we'd like to get you below close to 120 if possible and at very least below 130 you the top number.

PATIENT R176
You mean on the blood pressure how many times a day I'm supposed to take that?

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Take what, measure your blood pressure or take the pills?

PATIENT R176
The pills?

FIRST DOCTOR R176
So.

PATIENT R176
I only take like once a day.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You're on a few different medicines, so the amlodipine.

PATIENT R176
I don't take nothing but once a day all day.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Yeah let me just look.  Amlodipine is once a day, Bumex is once a day um lisinopril once a day.  The metoprolol you're supposed to be on twice a day.

PATIENT R176

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Okay.  So yeah, yeah, that may be.

PATIENT R176
So I just have to start taking that twice.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Yeah you know which one Iâ€™m taking about?

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh, right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
50 mg.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You're supposed to be taking that twice a day you know so I would take it you know, it's supposed to be 12 hours apart.

PATIENT R176

FIRST DOCTOR R176

PATIENT R176
When I go to work and while I'm at work.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
We'll see where your blood pressure's at you know.  Um we won't make any changes.  The only change we'll make is that you'll start taking the metoprolol.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You know twice a day like its prescribed.

PATIENT R176
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And we'll follow up on it next time.

PATIENT R176
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um other than that, you doing okay? 

PATIENT R176
Good, real good.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Alright now the last thing, we talked about all your labs and your cholesterol looks good.  Um health maintenance um you actually had a colonoscopy this past summer.  Prostate weâ€™ll repeat @@@.  You had the flu shot this year.  And then last time I saw you.

PATIENT R176
Yeah you said did I want the flu shot today.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
But you had it, you already had it.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um and then you had the uh the tetanus diphtheria I gave you the last time you were here.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um and have you ever smoked in your life?

PATIENT R176
In the '70s.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Oh okay.  One last thing is uh doing an ultrasound of the abdomen and the reason what they, the recommendations are that any male, any male who smoked.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Should get checked one time at the age of 65.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Should check a one-time ultrasound of the belly.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um and what they're looking up is the aorta, that's the main blood vessel that goes, you know comes out of the heart.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And then goes you know.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Um so people who had smoked it puts you at risk for what's called an aneurysm so basically it's a weakness in the wall of the artery.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And it bulges out and then those can rupture and that's you know a very bad thing.

PATIENT R176
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
So they say anyone who smoked at the age 65 they recommend doing a one-time only ultrasound.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
Of the belly.

PATIENT R176
I haven't smoked in 20, 30 years.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
They say any smoking history.

PATIENT R176
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
You know just because it's such a, if it does happen it's such a devastating thing.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
And the way you check for it is very, very easy.  They just put a little probe on your belly.

PATIENT R176
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR R176
