DOCTOR R054
So you were on 5 units three times a day and 65 units of Glargine?

PATIENT R054
But she had me on 60 units of Glargine but they told me if it didn't do any good or go down in the morning go up to 65.

DOCTOR R054
What we could do if you don’t get…

PATIENT R054
It's not getting it done.

DOCTOR R054
No @@@.  Okay let's see.  That's not too good, not too good.

PATIENT R054
@@@ my sugars were better.

DOCTOR R054
@@@.  So then when did you start the 65?

PATIENT R054
Well now a week ago.

DOCTOR R054
And you started on 5 units of Aspart.

PATIENT R054
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R054
Before meals?

PATIENT R054
Right.

DOCTOR R054
Three times a day?

PATIENT R054
Right.

DOCTOR R054
And did you notice improvement in your sugars after you had gone up to 65?  Or was it still the same thing?

PATIENT R054
The same thing. After I eat dinner, around 6:30, 7 o'clock I'm not eating anything.

DOCTOR R054
@@@.  

PATIENT R054
When I'm waking up @@@ 260 you know, 240.

DOCTOR R054
Have you been peeing a lot?

PATIENT R054
Oh yeah @@@.

DOCTOR R054
Have you been real thirsty?

PATIENT R054
No, not real thirsty.  When I wake up in the night I be thirsty.

DOCTOR R054
Any chest pain, fever, chills?

PATIENT R054
No.

DOCTOR R054
No trouble breathing?

PATIENT R054
No.

DOCTOR R054
What about trying to, I mean obviously this does not, you know, help @@@ but what about exercise?

PATIENT R054
Yeah I try; I mean I try to walk a little bit yeah.  I might get on the treadmill and I might do seven minutes.  I know that ain't nothing but it's something.

DOCTOR R054
@@@  I mean I don't expect you to run a marathon.

PATIENT R054
Right.

DOCTOR R054
Now what happens?  Do you get real tired with that?

PATIENT R054
Oh I don't get tired that quick but my hip.  I guess it's because it's not used you know.

DOCTOR R054
What about when you take Tylenol does that help?

PATIENT R054
No.

DOCTOR R054
You don't want to take Tylenol?

PATIENT R054
Oh I have enough @@@ yeah @@@ you know if it's just from me not doing exercise.

DOCTOR R054
The problem is as we get older we'll get arthritis too, right.

PATIENT R054
I know I got that, especially here you know.

DOCTOR R054
Yeah so you know when your hip starts hurting, take the Tylenol before, before @@@ during, just to kind of calm it down so you can keep walking.

PATIENT R054
Alright.

DOCTOR R054
Cause you're doing the right thing and I know that your intentions are great.

PATIENT R054
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R054
But you just got to keep going.  You've got to find a way so you can keep exercises cause what happens when you exercise the muscles use up the sugar and you don’t need the insulin, you use it up without insulin okay.  That's the way the body's made you know.  The muscles, you know when you exercise they know that they can't wait for the insulin.

PATIENT R054
Right.

DOCTOR R054
They predict you and they use the sugar on their own and they're going to be dropping your sugar level and it's a natural way of the body controlling the diabetes.

PATIENT R054
Yeah like when I walk, I always get painful while I'm going, coming back it's you know, it's not too bad.

DOCTOR R054
Okay.  @@@ sugar is still @@@ controlled @@@ kidneys, not good.  And @@@ I think we've got to be real aggressive with this.  @@@.  I'm gonna talk to my boss, DOCTOR @@@.  Possibly going to 75 @@@ you’re at 65?

PATIENT R054
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R054
Possibly going to 75 and maybe increasing the Aspart to 8 units.  See how the 75 goes and if that's okay, then fine and if it's too high then going up to 9 units.

PATIENT R054
Okay, is there anything, in my prescriptions that could be making it?

DOCTOR R054
No.  This is what happens. This is what happens, so you know you get diabetes so then your pancreas which is the main organ involved with making insulin okay so when you first start getting diabetes, it's not making insulin well.

PATIENT R054
Right.

DOCTOR R054
Most of the cells are not working as they should be, but some of them still are, some of them are still working.  As time goes on the cells that are working start dying, they give up because they get fatigued.

PATIENT R054
Right.

DOCTOR R054
It's like pumping.

PATIENT R054
Yeah they're doing all the work.

DOCTOR R054
Exactly, so what you find is a lot of times people are controlled because some of those cells stop working and you get to the point that these cells kind of give up.  You know at that point, the cells are not producing anything so and the that's the insulin requirements that you’re having is normal in the sense that @@@ you know, what do you @@@ right.  But you know it's not, giving up hope @@@ not getting better @@@.

PATIENT R054
Right.

DOCTOR R054
You're eating fruits; you're eating good meals and watching it?

PATIENT R054
Right.

DOCTOR R054
At home you told me your blood pressures are less than 130s @@@?

PATIENT R054
Yeah.  Between 125.

DOCTOR R054
Alright, so you know don't worry about the, you know I mentioned when you're at home just write them down for me, you know write them and kind of keep a log @@@.

PATIENT R054
Well I @@@ got ‘em written down. I got a nurse coming a couple weeks @@@.

DOCTOR R054
But just write them down for me and bring it in so I can actually see it.

PATIENT R054
Let's go up to uh @@@.  Even 10 on that Aspart.

DOCTOR R054
Uh I mean the Aspart I don't know if it's gonna do the trick.

PATIENT R054
I don't either but I can't, it's hard for me to @@@ with one eye.  It's easier for me to see the 10.

DOCTOR R054
@@@.

PATIENT R054
Than it is for me to try to @@@.

DOCTOR R054
We'll see how it goes, we'll go up on the Lantus first.

PATIENT R054
Okay.

DOCTOR R054
And that'll help you out.  Other than that you been doing okay?

PATIENT R054
Yeah.

DOCTOR R054
Have a seat.  How's your vision doing?

PATIENT R054
Uh been about the same, bad.

DOCTOR R054
Have you seen the eye doctor yet?

PATIENT R054
They were supposed to put in a consult for low vision but I never heard anything about it.

DOCTOR R054
And you're gonna see the eye doctor soon?

PATIENT R054
No.

DOCTOR R054
Okay.  You can also pop by the clinic and let them know you’re supposed  low vision.

PATIENT R054
@@@.

DOCTOR R054
Don’t wait. Was it a long time ago?

PATIENT R054
Last month.

DOCTOR R054
@@@ yeah you should stop by the clinic and see what's going on.  Say ah for me.  Say ah.

PATIENT R054
Ah.

DOCTOR R054
But I know that some of this stuff would be definitely very helpful for you.

PATIENT R054
@@@ you know even with my glasses I can't see my watch.

DOCTOR R054
Take a deep breath, again, again.  Breathe normal now, @@@.  Any leg swelling?

PATIENT R054
This one all the time @@@.

DOCTOR R054
They both have a little swelling.  You're using the water pill right?

PATIENT R054
Yes.

DOCTOR R054
And when you're home are you elevating your legs?  You don't elevate them?

PATIENT R054
Yeah.

DOCTOR R054
Even when you're watching TV?

PATIENT R054
Hmm.

DOCTOR R054
Were you doing it?

PATIENT R054
Uh uh.

DOCTOR R054
Well when you're watching TV or just sitting down, you know on the couch, just keep them elevated.

PATIENT R054
A lot of times I'm laying down and elevate it and when I go in the bed.  @@@ pillows.

DOCTOR R054
Yeah.  @@@.  Your cholesterol looks great.  

PATIENT R054
It should because I’ve been taking that Metamucil.  @@@

DOCTOR R054
Yeah Metamucil is great.  Those keep the bowel going.

PATIENT R054
@@@.  Something in that medicine I'm taking it keeps me constipated.

DOCTOR R054
Right.  I might give you a couple of refills let me do that now, you’re running low on a lot of meds.

PATIENT R054
I need a refill on the @@@.  I mean I use @@@.

DOCTOR R054
@@@.

PATIENT R054
Right.

DOCTOR R054
I'm going to go talk with my attending and I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  74:38  DOCTOR IN:  85:08)

DOCTOR R054
Okay.  @@@ You’re having no problems giving yourself the insulin at all, I know your vision is not the best but you can still see the needle and the line.

PATIENT R054
Right, right.  @@@ I have to look real close.  I have a magnifier, even with a magnifier it's hard you know.  To see you know the lines.

DOCTOR R054
Are you confident you’re giving yourself the right dosage?

PATIENT R054
Oh yeah I believe so.

DOCTOR R054
100%?  90%?  75%?

PATIENT R054
Well on the Glargine, on the Aspart, I might miss, you know, one line or two.

DOCTOR R054
So on the Aspart the to 100, want to make sure you’re giving yourself 65.

PATIENT R054
On the Glargine.

DOCTOR R054
I want to make sure about that.

PATIENT R054
@@@ Isn’t it marked?  I might go halfway that's the way I've been judging it now.

DOCTOR R054
That’s the issue. I think maybe it might not have to do with how much we’re giving you, but maybe because of your vision then you have a hard time doing it.  Let me check something.  

DOCTOR R054
Do you live by yourself or is there anybody at home that could help you with it?

PATIENT R054
I'm all by myself.

(Silence from 87:38 - 90:59)

DOCTOR R054
So this is the stuff we're trying to figure out.  We're trying, we're gonna try to get something different that's gonna help with that.  Instead of using the needle, we're going to try to give you these insulin pen okay.  Instead of drawing blood, like drawing into a syringe you're going, it's a pump, not a pump but a little contraption okay and then it'll show the number on it. 

PATIENT R054
Oh.

DOCTOR R054
Instead of drawing and looking at the lines, you're going to set it for numbers and we think it is something that will help and it has a little insulin bottle.  Do you think that's be a lot easier than the insulin?

PATIENT R054
Yeah.  So I was going to tell you was if I made a mistake, it would be giving one or two units too much and not too less.

DOCTOR R054
Okay.  So you’re over-compensating?

PATIENT R054
I could be I mean, if that's my problem @@@.  Cause I have a problem counting those lines, I'm not going to go under, I'm not going to go over you know.

DOCTOR R054
So let's see.  I think if that could work and we could get these pens, it’s going to be a lot easier anyway and we should be 100% sure exactly how much you have okay.  Does that sound like a plan?

PATIENT R054
Whatever you want to do.  What about this Losartan?

DOCTOR R054
Oh yeah it's a blood blood pressure medication.

PATIENT R054
Oh I thought it was for the kidneys.

DOCTOR R054
Yeah it is for the kidneys cause the problem is your blood pressure and your sugar, aren’t well controlled - those are the two most important things.  We got to get your blood pressure and sugars corrected okay and no overloading your sugars.  So your blood pressure @@@ okay.

PATIENT R054
Yeah the blood pressure's fine cause it has dropped down to 113, 118 you know.  Like I said, most of the time at home, it could be the meter, because it’s always 120s, anywhere from 120-133 I'll say it like that.  It's never in the 140s at home.  That's why I'm so surprised because today it was 147.

DOCTOR R054
Well let me go check with him once more.

(DOCTOR OUT:  93:29)  DOCTOR IN:  94:10)

FIRST DOCTOR R054
We'll have you on your way we just want to check out one more spot.

SECOND DOCTOR R054
Alright.

PATIENT R054
Hi.

SECOND DOCTOR R054
So um the only um, @@@ short acting @@@ the only change is that um @@@ Glargine and @@@.  The @@@ pen is actually cheaper @@@ VA physician prefers.  Glargine can be switched @@@ unit to unit.

PATIENT R054
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR R054
So that would be the preferred option.  @@@.  There are two @@@ but can you feel it click, to get your dose as opposed to having to measure you know.

PATIENT R054
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR R054
So it's easier for people who can't see 100% anymore.  @@@ non formulary and I guess @@@.  

FIRST DOCTOR R054
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR R054
Yes definitely.  Okay, good.

FIRST DOCTOR R054
Alright we'll do that.

PATIENT R054
Sounds good.

FIRST DOCTOR R054
We'll try to do this.  

PATIENT R054
But I can still take them at the same time?

FIRST DOCTOR R054
Exactly, the same.

PATIENT R054
@@@ don't mix them.

FIRST DOCTOR R054
So it looks right now, a couple of things.  I'm willing to go up to 70 as long as you're more or less sure that you're giving yourself.  How confident are you that you're giving yourself 65?

PATIENT R054
Um well I 100%

DOCTOR R054
@@@ so we'll do 70.  And 70 units at night right?

PATIENT R054
Yes.

DOCTOR R054
They are going to mail these, okay. Actually you could probably pick it up at the window, let’s see what happens.

PATIENT R054
Yeah okay.  Now I need the, I order the isosorbide. 

DOCTOR R054
Okay.

PATIENT R054
I need it now cause.

DOCTOR R054
Are you talking about @@@.

PATIENT R054
I take it three times a day.

DOCTOR R054
Okay so we're giving you a pen for that.

PATIENT R054
No, no, that's the insulin.

DOCTOR R054
Yeah we're going to adjust the insulin.

PATIENT R054
Uh is this the, this is the one for the heart.

DOCTOR R054
Oh okay, I'm going to refill all of your medications.  

PATIENT R054
@@@.  The last time they gave me 160,000 refills.

DOCTOR R054
Did you have to pay for it?

PATIENT R054
Yeah and I did then, but I don't know why they not charging me now.  Somebody made a mistake somehow.  I know that @@@ pay so much @@@ in a year.  So right now I'm worried about my kidneys failing because of that dialysis.  

DOCTOR R054
@@@ it always help just having it syringes and all @@@ pens @@@ refills so you know you just put the little @@@ they'll show you how to do it.  Put the cartridges in, select the number and @@@ still using the .

PATIENT R054

PATIENT R054

PATIENT R054

DOCTOR R054
You're out of refills. Do you want more refills for the future?

PATIENT R054
Yes, more refills. I do that three times a day too.

DOCTOR R054
The Losartan, okay, the metoprolol.  Quetiapine and furosemide.

PATIENT R054
Furosemide 

DOCTOR R054
Omeprazole?

PATIENT R054

DOCTOR R054

DOCTOR R054

PATIENT R054

DOCTOR R054

PATIENT R054
No, it just comes automatically if I don't, you know like I say after three or four days you know.

DOCTOR R054
Simvastatin.  Are you using the Vicodin [ill?

PATIENT R054
No, I haven't.

DOCTOR R054
Isosorbide.

PATIENT R054

DOCTOR R054

PATIENT R054
If they still want me to take it.  @@@ take it just once a week.

DOCTOR R054
