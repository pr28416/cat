PATIENT K664
No I'm the only person staying in my place.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  Does this feel like its getting better or it's been about the same?

PATIENT K664
I think it's getting a little better.  It's better than the first two days you know, I was taking Alka-Seltzer Plus.

DOCTOR K664
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K664
And I had some cough syrup that I had from the last visit.

DOCTOR K664
Yeah did that help?

PATIENT K664
Yeah it helped.

DOCTOR K664
So it's mostly the cough and then when you cough you're getting a little bit of a headache.

PATIENT K664
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K664
Um going on for like seven days.  No fevers at all, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that.

PATIENT K664
No, chest pains yes.

DOCTOR K664
With the cough?

PATIENT K664
Yeah with the cough but before I got sick this whole left side from the arm got real stiff and this sharp pain went all the way up to the shoulder where I couldn't even lift my shoulder.

DOCTOR K664
Okay are you still having that?

PATIENT K664
Yeah in both shoulders now.

DOCTOR K664
Just shoulder pain?

PATIENT K664
Yeah.

DOCTOR K664
Okay so where, it's just pain it's just right here?

PATIENT K664
Yeah.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  Let me see something.  How bad is the shoulder pain on a scale from 1-10?

PATIENT K664
7.

DOCTOR K664
But it's in both shoulders?

PATIENT K664
Yeah.  And at times both my hands stiffen up a lot.

DOCTOR K664
Uh-huh.  Did you hurt your shoulders at all?  Have you been doing any heavy lifting at all?  What do you do for work?  Do you work?

PATIENT K664
No I was in a car accident in 2006 that left me in a coma.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.

PATIENT K664
And then I got screws and wires in both of my ankles.

DOCTOR K664
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K664
And uh plate holder in my hip.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  But with the shoulders, were those hurt in the accident too?

PATIENT K664
Yeah.

DOCTOR K664
Have those hurt ever since the accident?

PATIENT K664
Yeah.

DOCTOR K664
Is this different?  And how long has it been worse for?

PATIENT K664
It comes and goes.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  But no new injury or anything?

PATIENT K664
No.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.

PATIENT K664
I notice I can't even do an arm curl with the curl bar because right along there it's like it hurts real bad so can't do that and even when I, when I start and I cut down on a lot of the heavy weights, I'm not doing heavy lifting but when I try to do push-ups it hurts.

DOCTOR K664
In your shoulder or it hurts right here?

PATIENT K664
It hurts in the shoulders.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  Well I mean maybe you've got some arthritis in the shoulder or maybe there's something else.  We could probably just; we could try imaging you know we could get some x-rays to see if there's anything going on in there um let me see.  Otherwise so you are 53.  Are you a smoker?

PATIENT K664
No.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  Have you ever been?

PATIENT K664
Nope.

DOCTOR K664
Excellent.  Um did you get your flu shot this year?  Do you want to get it today?

PATIENT K664
Uh uh.

DOCTOR K664
Okay any reason?

PATIENT K664
No I'm not taking shots.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.

PATIENT K664
Really I don't like needles.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.

PATIENT K664
I keep forgetting to bring my medical records here from Rush, that's where I was going when I was in a car accident.

DOCTOR K664
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K664
And then I was in the hospital for at least three months.

DOCTOR K664
Yeah, that'd be useful to have here um, let me see, otherwise you're 53.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT K664
What is that?

DOCTOR K664
They put a camera up your bottom.

PATIENT K664
Yeah they did that um about two years ago.

DOCTOR K664
Okay I'll go take a look, @@@@.  Okay it looks like you need another one next year.

PATIENT K664
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  Okay and they saw the last time DOCTOR referred you to our MOVE Program for some weight loss, did you ever see them?  What do you think?

PATIENT K664
It was great.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  Are you still going there?

PATIENT K664
No that was, that was for about a couple of weeks so I finished that program.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  They gave some good pointers and things.

PATIENT K664
Yeah cause I lost a lot of weight.

DOCTOR K664
Oh good.  How much weight have you lost, let's take a look.

PATIENT K664
I was 316 when I entered the program, right now I'm 288.

DOCTOR K664
Awesome.  Okay.  You want to sit up here for me?  Now when you cough and you get this mucous up does it feel better when you get it up?

PATIENT K664
Yeah.  I been swallowing much better once it comes up.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  So I think we can give you like a cough syrup or something that'll help break that stuff up.

PATIENT K664
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K664
A lot of times when people have symptoms like this it's just a viral kind of infection where antibiotics don't really work.  You know viral infections, usually there's a lot of those going around right now, you know the weather the way it is.

PATIENT K664
Yes.

DOCTOR K664
Um they usually will last like 10 to 14 days and you kind of just let it run its course I mean it's not anything to treat really.  We can get you some cough syrup and things like that to kind of help with the symptoms.

PATIENT K664
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K664
There's nothing we can really, you know we don't really need to treat anything so it'll go away on its own.  Um.

PATIENT K664
I got another question.

DOCTOR K664
Yeah.

PATIENT K664
I think I know how I caught it.  I have family members that smoke and when I go over to their house it's like damn.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.

PATIENT K664
Like I be like, you got kids and all the smoking and the next thing I know…

DOCTOR K664
Yeah.

PATIENT K664
My throat gets all scratchy.

DOCTOR K664
Yeah that's from the smoking.

PATIENT K664
Yeah cause every time I get sick it’s coming from, the next day I know.

DOCTOR K664
Yeah I mean a lot of people will kind of get like a small bronchitis you know cause smoke irritates your lungs.

PATIENT K664
It do, it really irritates me so I'm gonna stay from over there.

DOCTOR K664
Yeah.  Stick your tongue out for me.  Say ah.

PATIENT K664
Ah.

DOCTOR K664
Okay good.  Yeah that @@@ at home.

PATIENT K664
@@@ right here it @@@.

DOCTOR K664
Your ear how long has that been going on for?

PATIENT K664
For a couple of months.

DOCTOR K664
Couple of months okay.  Did you ever have your hearing checked?

PATIENT K664
No.

DOCTOR K664
Okay, alright let me take a listen here.  Just breathe normally.  Okay deep breaths in and out through your mouth.  Okay great let me just listen.  Okay any pain down here anywhere?

PATIENT K664
No.

DOCTOR K664
Okay any swelling in your legs?

PATIENT K664
Just the ankles.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  Is that normal for you?

PATIENT K664
Because the screws and wires down there @@@.

DOCTOR K664
Right, right, okay.  Let me take a look at this one here.  Okay now the shoulders, put your arms up like this for me, keep them up, keep them up, keep them up, does that hurt?

PATIENT K664
Yeah.

DOCTOR K664
Okay put them out in front of you.  Okay, put them out to the side, up above your head, okay.  So I mean that's, the fact is you've got a pretty good range of motion of the shoulders is a good sign.  I don't think there's any kind of serious injury or anything.  Um I think we could just get some x-rays.

PATIENT K664
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K664
Just to see.  There might be some arthritis or something there um.  It doesn't seem like that bothers you too much with the moving around right?  It looked like you were doing okay with that.

PATIENT K664
Right.

DOCTOR K664
Um so maybe we'll do some x-rays and we'll see how those look okay.

PATIENT K664
Okay.

DOCTOR K664
Alright I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR so I'll be back okay.

PATIENT K664
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  41:28  DOCTOR IN:  47:17)

DOCTOR K664
Okay so a couple of things.  So I talked to DOCTOR and we were talking about the shoulders.  We don't think it's anything serious.  I think we could probably go without the x-ray; I want to talk to you about this and see what you think.  So I think that any time you get any kind of x-ray or CT scan you're getting radiation right.  Based on your exam, it's nothing serious.

PATIENT K664
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K664
And that, at the worst, maybe there's some arthritis but just based on the ability, your strength and your range of motion it's nothing serious.  I think we could go without the x-rays just to spare you the radiation cause you know how it leads to risk down the line.  In terms of the cough, I'm gonna give you something called guaifenesin, kind of like Mucinex; it helps you bring up this gunk.  I don't think we need to, I think it should get better over the next couple of days.  It sounds like it already is getting better.  The smoke, being around the smokers is probably you know, as you've noticed, is probably contributing to it quite a bit.

PATIENT K664
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K664
So I would try to stay out of that as much as you can.  I'll write you a prescription unless do you have the cough syrup at home still?

PATIENT K664
No I ran out.

DOCTOR K664
So we'll get you some here.  Do you want to pick it up at the window?

PATIENT K664
Yeah.

DOCTOR K664
Okay and then um other than that I mean your labs were last checked just in November so I don't think you need to come back and so, unless something comes up, until November.

PATIENT K664
Okay when is my next appointment?  My next appointment is in March right?

DOCTOR K664
Well we got to make it for you but your next one; you have an Endocrinology appointment in March.

PATIENT K664
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K664
March 1st.  That was the one you follow up for the, you know for the testosterone and things like that.

PATIENT K664
Oh okay. 

DOCTOR K664
So that is on March 1st at 10:00 a.m. but to see us I think November is probably okay unless of course something comes up and you need to be seen sooner, we can see you sooner.

PATIENT K664
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K664
Okay.  Alright, so just stop by the Pharmacy on the way out and then return back to the clinic in nine months.  There you go.

PATIENT K664
Okay.

DOCTOR K664
Alright have a good day alright.

PATIENT K664
So give the paperwork to the people out front right?

DOCTOR K664
Yeah.  Perfect.

PATIENT K664
Thank you.

DOCTOR K664
Have a good day.

PATIENT K664
You too.
