The sleeping is pretty good you know.  I'm working a job and it's pretty physical and so I take, sometimes I take a pain pill, over-the-counter.

DOCTOR F058

DOCTOR F058
Good, good.  Alright um.  What are you working doing now?

PATIENT F058

DOCTOR F058
Yeah that's alright.  Um we sent you to the cardiologist and you didn't want an ICD put in?

PATIENT F058
No I didn't want it put in.

DOCTOR F058
Okay.  Cause you've got risks @@@ I mean you don't have to have it put in, it's proven to help people survive longer and people @@@.

PATIENT F058
Right.

DOCTOR F058
You know, think about until the next time we can talk about it again.

PATIENT F058

DOCTOR F058
So we are going to recheck cholesterol today too.  It was not where we wanted the last time but it was close.

PATIENT F058
Yeah.

DOCTOR F058
Um checked the kidney function again.  Um are you using the patches for the nicotine?

Yes.

DOCTOR F058
Okay.  @@@.  And how about that colonoscopy?

PATIENT F058
Yeah I had one four or five years ago.

DOCTOR F058
Yeah you had one in 2006 but you had something in there that was a little big.

PATIENT F058
Oh okay.

DOCTOR F058
A polyp.

PATIENT F058
@@@ okay.

DOCTOR F058
That's why so it's one of those things that we'd like to follow up because it could go into a cancer and I think after like three years you should probably have it checked.  @@@ if we checked it now and it's not there then you can go back and say okay we'll back off a little bit but I think it's one of @@@ young.

PATIENT F058
Right.

DOCTOR F058
That make sense?

PATIENT F058
Can it wait for like uh, see what it is, is I'm working and I have to take the whole day off.

DOCTOR F058
Right.

PATIENT F058
I can go off and on with work and I don't know exactly what days I won’t be working.

DOCTOR F058
Can’t you schedule that ahead of time because you’ve already put it off for a while so I'm worried you know about how much time is passing.

PATIENT F058
Uh-huh.

Along with the insulin.  So I'm supposed to take two in the morning and two in the evening, sometimes I take one in the evening.

DOCTOR F058
We could almost stop and just use all insulin.

PATIENT F058
Okay.

DOCTOR F058
@@@.

PATIENT F058
Okay.

DOCTOR F058
If you want to stop those pills.

PATIENT F058
Yeah.  That means I would have to go to the fast-acting one?

DOCTOR F058
Oh no, all you have to do is the insulin @@@.

PATIENT F058
Okay.

DOCTOR F058
You just do the insulin by itself.

PATIENT F058
Yeah that'd be fine.

DOCTOR F058
Okay.  Let's see, how about what we do is uh, 20 b.i.d. of the glipizide.  Let me see what the pharmacist said last time.  So let's keep it on and we'll talk with her and then um we'll titrate it down.

PATIENT F058

DOCTOR F058
That'll work for you?

PATIENT F058
That'll work.  I haven't even used it, I've never used it.

DOCTOR F058

PATIENT F058
Right, right.

DOCTOR F058
And let me know, as long as it's working.

PATIENT F058

DOCTOR F058

DOCTOR F058
Don't take everything away but don't eat as much of some of stuff.

PATIENT F058
Right.
