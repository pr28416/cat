PATIENT M191
Yeah.

DOCTOR M191
I can't stress to you know how important it is to quit.

PATIENT M191
I know, I know.

DOCTOR M191
We don’t know why you had a stroke.

PATIENT M191
Right.

DOCTOR M191
And on top of that you also had sensation in your chest pain @@@ cause a heart attack.

PATIENT M191
Yeah.  When was the @@@.

DOCTOR M191
No it was @@@ coronary arteries.

PATIENT M191
Oh okay.  @@@ stop smoking right.

DOCTOR M191
It's, so you have a bunch of arteries that run through your heart and it's inside of heart @@@.

PATIENT M191
Right.

DOCTOR M191
Blood, @@@ heart muscle.

PATIENT M191
Right.

DOCTOR M191
After a heart attack if you have some plaque within those coronary arteries or cholesterol.

PATIENT M191
Right.

DOCTOR M191
And @@@ weakening vessel wall and what happens is your smoking can cause clotting of the artery.

PATIENT M191
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M191
Causes a heart attack and kills the heart muscle.

PATIENT M191
Oh.

DOCTOR M191
Around it.

PATIENT M191
That’s interesting.

DOCTOR M191
We caught yours before.

PATIENT M191
Yeah right, @@@.

DOCTOR M191
Before it causes the clot.

PATIENT M191
Yeah.

DOCTOR M191
And it's a good thing we did, but one of the reasons you had that is because you smoke.

PATIENT M191
Okay.

DOCTOR M191
So.

PATIENT M191
I'm not @@@ ready for that yet.

DOCTOR M191
You're at risk for another heart attack; you're also at risk for another stroke.

PATIENT M191
Oh okay.

DOCTOR M191
Um it increases your risk tremendously just by smoking.

PATIENT M191
Okay.

DOCTOR M191
On top of that your lungs, you know, 5-10 years down the road.

PATIENT M191
Yeah.

DOCTOR M191
That also have what is called emphysema.

PATIENT M191
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR M191
COPD.  If you don't already have a little bit.  Now if you continue to smoke that'll just get worse.

PATIENT M191
I understand.

DOCTOR M191
If you stop smoking, any lethal damage to your lungs.

PATIENT M191
Will heal that right?

DOCTOR M191
It might not heal but the lungs won't get worse.  Does that make sense?

PATIENT M191
Yeah.

DOCTOR M191
And you're setting yourself for some major problems if you continue to smoke.

PATIENT M191
Okay.  I will quit entirely.  It's not worth that.

DOCTOR M191
Yeah, um.  Give me a couple of minutes and I will be back okay.

PATIENT M191

PATIENT M191

DOCTOR M191
Is it sustaining an erection or getting an erection?

PATIENT M191
Sustaining.

DOCTOR M191
Cause the Viagra won't help with sustaining it.

PATIENT M191
@@@.

DOCTOR M191
It will help with getting an erection.

PATIENT M191
Okay.

DOCTOR M191
Again, I think.

PATIENT M191
@@@.

DOCTOR M191
I would ask the cardiologist and just have him @@@.

PATIENT M191
Okay.

DOCTOR M191
