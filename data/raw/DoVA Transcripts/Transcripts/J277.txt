DOCTOR J277
No I get it.

PATIENT J277

DOCTOR J277
Oh yeah, I mean it's not in your computer anymore.  Some of these probably are old ones, you should just remove them.

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
If they don't match that list.

PATIENT J277
That's what I'm saying.

DOCTOR J277
Yeah.

PATIENT J277
Anything that I don't need I want to put it in that little grey box over there.

DOCTOR J277
Yeah.  And you did all these changes here that we talked about?  You know like I got things right here.

PATIENT J277
I started taking a half now and this @@@

DOCTOR J277
Yeah you did all those changes right, okay.  And you stopped taking the potassium all together?

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
Okay and then the metformin, your diabetes one you cut in half.

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
And then the other one.

PATIENT J277
Well you done sent me the 500s already.

DOCTOR J277
Right, right.

PATIENT J277
So I ain't got to cut them in half.

DOCTOR J277
But before you got them I had you cut them in half.

PATIENT J277
I was cutting them in half right.

DOCTOR J277
Okay and then the water pill once you got this combination one you stopped this one as far as you know or?

PATIENT J277
Okay what's the water pill?

DOCTOR J277
That's hydrochlorothiazide.  So this was your old one.  But I said when the new medicine comes stop this one and we'll change it to this one, so that should be one of the things that when you got this one when you read the bottle, should throw out this old one.

PATIENT J277
Okay.

DOCTOR J277
So I don't know, I mean here's the new list so it will be easier  but uh, you know you can  keep this okay, let's just look at that and we'll check mark if it’s here.  So that's there.

DOCTOR J277
Exactly.  This is, yep this is that new one I sent you, take one half tablet by mouth every day yep.  That’s that.  Metoprolol this you take one half twice a day, Linsinopril, see maybe these are as many as you're supposed to take.  There's those and I think these are all your regular ones actually.  Terazosin, I mean these creams I'm not really counting, I don't really know if you take those anymore still.  The creams, what's this?  Oh this.

PATIENT J277
Okay I got one tablet left in one of those bottles.

PATIENT J277
Okay.  So everything in that thing I supposed to be taking.

DOCTOR J277
Yeah, use before November @@, @@@@, August okay, so you want to take one pill by mouth every day 40 mg, you want to combine these two?

PATIENT J277
Well see my wife tell me I shouldn’t mix the lot together I should empty one before I start on the other one.

DOCTOR J277
You can yeah well you can do that.  They both have good expiration dates, you know neither one of them expired.

PATIENT J277
Okay.  Well doc.

DOCTOR J277
So not me, I don't want to confuse yourself here so.

PATIENT J277
We can pour them together.  Yeah I can get rid of one of them bottles.

DOCTOR J277
Yeah I mean as long as you read it carefully, if they're both not expired and they both say 40 mg and they're the same doses.  They may look different but then maybe if it's different manufacturers or what it may be.

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
So, these actually they look the exact same.

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
I know they're 40 mg tablets so you can combine these two if you want.

PATIENT J277
No I don't take the magnesium.

DOCTOR J277
Everything with a check mark.  The only two that aren't are some creams that I don't really know if you need it anymore or not.

PATIENT J277

With the metformin it's keeping it, you know, I would say every now and then I might cheat and get me a piece of cake or something it might run up to 120 or something but.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.

PATIENT J277
Then boom, you know the next day its back where it's supposed to be.

DOCTOR J277
Okay cause we actually, you know we cut down; we didn't want to be that aggressive even because your sugars were almost too well controlled.  So what they're normally like 120s or something or?

PATIENT J277
Right, they're normally in the 120s.

DOCTOR J277

PATIENT J277
It's been bad.  I signed up, I did some @@@ probably a year ago but it just doubled since I did that.

DOCTOR J277
Okay, do you want to, you know I know they have different options here.  They have either kind of behavioral therapy, kind of like one to one or something.  I think there may be even someone down here that we can try to set you up with and she can tell you who the best person to go is.

PATIENT J277
Okay.

DOCTOR J277
Or like a group session.  There's also group PTSD. I don’t know if you have a preference.

PATIENT J277
And with him or her direct me.

DOCTOR J277
Okay, alright.  We can see.

PATIENT J277
Maybe direct.

PATIENT J277
There we go.  

DOCTOR J277
So we'll do that.

PATIENT J277
Very good.

DOCTOR J277
Remind me before we leave uh let's see here blood pressure today looked good.  No lightheadedness or dizziness or anything like that?

PATIENT J277
Hmm no.

DOCTOR J277
Okay, alright.

PATIENT J277
But here's what I'm saying, I been losing my balance and all kind of stuff lately.

DOCTOR J277
Oh you have.

PATIENT J277
Yes.

DOCTOR J277
Hmm.

PATIENT J277
And then I've got a semi-dizziness going on you know.

DOCTOR J277
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J277
It's not so dizzy that I feel like I need somebody to hold me up or something but like I'm sitting down right now.

DOCTOR J277
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J277
And my head is spinning a little you know it's not, I don't feel stable anymore.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.  You don't okay um.  How long has that been going on?

PATIENT J277
Oh shit, two, three months.

DOCTOR J277
Two, three months okay.

PATIENT J277
But like I say it to me seem like it’s getting worse.

DOCTOR J277
Hmm.  Okay.  Let's see, maybe I mean I'm wondering if your blood pressures are a little too low too cause you had one here that was 96/54.

PATIENT J277
Right that's kind of low.

DOCTOR J277
Uh that's kind of low.  Especially if you're saying you feel a little lightheaded and dizzy at times um okay.  So maybe we can cut down on some of, you're on four different blood pressure medicines, maybe we could get rid of one you know and just kind of see how your blood pressure does.  Let me see how it's yeah the problem is it was high back in September but otherwise it's looking pretty good okay.  And you've been eating well and everything like that?

PATIENT J277
Yeah.

DOCTOR J277
No vomiting or anything like that?

PATIENT J277
No.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.  You haven't fell or anything?

PATIENT J277
I'm sorry?

DOCTOR J277
You haven't fell or anything recently?

PATIENT J277
No.

DOCTOR J277
And this lightheadedness you said you've been having, is that mainly like if you go from sitting to standing or something all of a sudden?

PATIENT J277
Yeah right.

DOCTOR J277
Once you're up and about are you okay or?

PATIENT J277
Right well I you know I'm in bad shape now I don't really stand long, I make sure.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.

PATIENT J277
That I don't have to stand long.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.  Um alright, let's see.  Alright um.

PATIENT J277
And doc if so.

DOCTOR J277
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J277
If you can, I would like an appointment to go see that one on one.

DOCTOR J277
Yeah.

PATIENT J277
It's because I had @@@ come out with me today cause I wasn't feeling that well.

DOCTOR J277

PATIENT J277
No.

DOCTOR J277
Okay but you saw the other guy.

PATIENT J277
And is there anything @@@ feel like I'm just energy depleted.  

DOCTOR J277
Hmm I mean yeah see I'm not sure if it's just a combination of maybe your low blood pressure but it generally it's pretty good.  Today it's the first time it's kind of low um let's see.  I mean we could try to maybe go down on your blood pressure med a little bit, maybe that's causing you to be too low.

PATIENT J277
And maybe just see.

DOCTOR J277
You said your wife, I know, checks it at home.  Do you remember what those numbers are?

PATIENT J277
She just checked it last night too you know.  

DOCTOR J277
Okay.

PATIENT J277
Cause really when she check it I really don't pay no attention unless she say ooh NAME this is too low or it's too high you know.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.

PATIENT J277
And she tell me it’s okay.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.  And you have that sleep appointment coming up right?

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
Uh in March, yeah it's in March for your appointment okay and you are still using that mask and everything?  That's the other thing that's gonna be important sometimes you know.

PATIENT J277
Yes sir.

DOCTOR J277
Okay, see that can be a big reason if you're tired and stuff if you're not using that properly.

PATIENT J277
Okay.

DOCTOR J277
That's one of those things if you're not using it, you're not breathing well in the middle of the night then you get real tired during the day.  Even if you sleep eight hours it's not gonna be eight good hours of sleep.

PATIENT J277
Okay.

DOCTOR J277
Um so if you're using it you know how much are you using it per night, the whole night?

PATIENT J277
No.

DOCTOR J277
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J277
I may, my DOCTOR.

DOCTOR J277
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J277
She's telling me do it at least two hours.  I might do three or four hours, that's the most.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.  Alright um.

PATIENT J277
But see I'm getting up all night peeing and I can't break, I say I can't I haven't broke the habit of not drinking no liquids after 8 o'clock yet.

DOCTOR J277
Okay you're still drinking them.

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.

PATIENT J277
And don’t I know, being at 68 years that you put that water in there you know it got to come out.

DOCTOR J277
Right, exactly and now and you know you're on the water pill and everything um so let's see.  Okay and let's see, you're not a smoker or anything?

PATIENT J277
No.  I got enough problem with it I don't need those.  I don't need to add to it.

DOCTOR J277
Okay and I want to see if your labs came back today.  Uh your potassium looks a lot better that's good.

PATIENT J277
That's from today and they done got it back already?

DOCTOR J277
Uh-huh.  Yep.  Your creatinine is kind of high okay.

PATIENT J277
My wife told me that @@@ I just started Wednesday on the new system.

DOCTOR J277
What system?

PATIENT J277
The half a tablet a day that you know.

DOCTOR J277
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J277
I guess it does Monday, to Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, today is the sixth time I did it.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.  Alright.  Let me go talk with DOCTOR and let him know how you're doing uh maybe try to cut down on some of your blood pressure meds and see if that helps and I'll find out who you can talk to over there and just give you the information since you don't want to go today right?

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
Okay, alright uh that sound fair?

PATIENT J277
Is she gonna have to make me an appointment or how we gonna work that?

DOCTOR J277
I'll ask her yeah.

PATIENT J277
Okay.

DOCTOR J277
@@@.

PATIENT J277
That'll be good.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.

PATIENT J277
Yes sir, I'm okay with that.

DOCTOR J277
Okay now you're okay on all your medicines you think right?

PATIENT J277
Yes sir yeah.

DOCTOR J277
Give me a second here.

(DOCTOR OUT:  38:26  DOCTOR IN:  45:31)

DOCTOR J277
Alright, did you get the flu shot?

PATIENT J277
Yeah.

DOCTOR J277
Oh you did okay.  Alright so one other thing, do you said you're eating and drinking well, how many glasses of water do you think you have a day?  A lot or just kind of?

PATIENT J277
A lot.

DOCTOR J277
A lot okay um cause it looks like you know your kidney level went up a little bit um but so did another level it could maybe because of the water pill that we gave you may be a little bit dry so you know try taking in a little bit more fluid you know, maybe that's what's causing the low blood pressure.

PATIENT J277
Right.  Okay.

DOCTOR J277
You know so just.

PATIENT J277
To tell you the truth about it.

DOCTOR J277
Yeah.

PATIENT J277
It's not so much I been drinking a lot of water.

DOCTOR J277
Oh okay.

PATIENT J277
I been drinking a lot of apple cider.

DOCTOR J277
Okay.

PATIENT J277
And when I drink the apple cider I don't drink as much water.

DOCTOR J277
Oh okay.  So you know cause your kidney function went up a little bit, nothing abnormal outside of where you've been before.  It's been that way before uh your blood pressure is down a little bit so maybe you're just a little bit dehydrated or something and that's why your kidneys are going up, that's why the blood pressure is a little bit low and on top you're taking a water pill so maybe we can try you know staying better hydrated.

PATIENT J277
And I'll just stay off the apple cider and drink more water.

DOCTOR J277
Do you drink a lot of caffeine and stuff that'd be the other thing to just cut that out.  That dehydrates you.

PATIENT J277
I don't drink no coffee.

DOCTOR J277
You're not a coffee drinker.

PATIENT J277
Well you now once in a while, I ain't gonna say I don't drink no coffee.

DOCTOR J277
Okay, alright.

PATIENT J277
A couple cups a month or something.

DOCTOR J277
Okay alright but not a lot of Coke or anything like that either?

PATIENT J277
Uh uh.

DOCTOR J277
Okay, alright um so maybe that's what we'll try to do is just kind of try staying a little bit hydrated.

PATIENT J277
Okay.

DOCTOR J277
And see if that kind of improves things.

PATIENT J277
Very good.

DOCTOR J277
Um the other thing is well actually you know because your kidneys did go up a little bit.

PATIENT J277
Yeah.

DOCTOR J277
Metformin is one of those things that is broken down by the kidneys.

PATIENT J277
Yeah.

DOCTOR J277
The question is how much do you need the metformin still or not um so what we'd like to do actually is maybe stop your metformin completely.

PATIENT J277
Okay.

DOCTOR J277
Give you a trial off of it because your numbers have looked so good before and have you come back in three months, kind of similar to what you did now with labs.

PATIENT J277
Very good, very good.

DOCTOR J277
Get the labs drawn; we'll see what the hemoglobin A1c is.

PATIENT J277
No problem.

DOCTOR J277
And if it looks good then you might not need anything for your diabetes.  If it looks a little bit worse but not terrible we can put you on a different pill that's just usually like once a day and it doesn't affect the kidneys as much.

PATIENT J277
Very good.

DOCTOR J277
So this may be a good time to give you a trial to see if you need the medicine at all.  If you don't.

PATIENT J277
Very good.

DOCTOR J277
You know then no reason to.

PATIENT J277
I'm glad to do that.

DOCTOR J277
Um obviously one other thing is to continue checking your sugars and if they start getting real sky high or higher than they normally run call us back and then maybe we'll start you on this pill then sooner than that.

PATIENT J277
But what you're saying is when I leave here today.

DOCTOR J277
Yeah.

PATIENT J277
I don't worry about the half a pill that I supposed to be taking.

DOCTOR J277
Right, yeah don't take it but still check your sugars.

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
Okay and if your sugar is now 120 and if it starts getting into 190, 200.

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
That's really high.

PATIENT J277
Yeah then go back on my metformin.

DOCTOR J277
No, no, then call us and we'll probably send you a different pill.

PATIENT J277
You got that, do I have your number?

DOCTOR J277
Yeah I mean you just have to call the Red Clinic here, uh do you want to write it down on that paper yeah, NUMBER okay.

PATIENT J277
Okay.

DOCTOR J277
And that way, I think we could try to get you off the metformin period uh it's just a weaker medicine if you need it.  

PATIENT J277
Very good.

DOCTOR J277
But if your sugars start getting high call us back and maybe we'll mail you a different medicine, not the metformin.

PATIENT J277
Okay doc, thanks a lot.

DOCTOR J277
Uh so I'll stop that on your list and then let me see uh and then you're gonna get the labs drawn before your next appointment.

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
Like you did this time.

PATIENT J277
Just like I did this morning.

DOCTOR J277
So they'll send you a letter, you know with the exact date and time just come in you know an hour or two before that and get your lab done.

PATIENT J277
Right.

DOCTOR J277
So it'll be in the computer.

PATIENT J277
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR J277
Let me see if that lady is down there um before you walk all the way down there let me see if she's there.  Alright, we'll see if we can just get the number from up there she wasn't at her door.

PATIENT J277
Okay.

DOCTOR J277
So maybe give you her number and then maybe you can give her a call.

PATIENT J277
Okay.

DOCTOR J277
