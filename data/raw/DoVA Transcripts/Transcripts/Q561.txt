DOCTOR Q561
Okay.

PATIENT Q561
Otherwise it don't really be high I me.  When I took it at home it was like 130 something you know or something like that.  You know it don't be high like 150.

DOCTOR Q561
Sure, alright okay.  Let's see, I'm just gonna look at your lab work to see if there's anything done here recently.

PATIENT Q561
I don't think so; I didn't have no blood taken in a while.

DOCTOR Q561
Yeah we need to update that.  The last time you had anything was um electrolytes and checking your kidney function in July and back then it was okay.  So will you be able to go to the Lab, I mean have you eaten yet today?

PATIENT Q561
Yeah I ate this morning.

DOCTOR Q561
Yes.

PATIENT Q561
Ate this morning, but I ain't had nothing for lunch.

DOCTOR Q561
Okay.  So.

PATIENT Q561
Which is more than like before 6 o'clock so you should be able to draw some blood right?

DOCTOR Q561
Yeah the, unfortunately I want to check your cholesterol too and to check your cholesterol you can't have eaten anything um from midnight until you get the lab work and then.

PATIENT Q561
So I got to come back okay.

DOCTOR Q561
So yeah.  Yeah and you can do that anytime within the next month and I'll take a look at them and in the computer a follow-up.

PATIENT Q561
Come in here, don't eat no breakfast, come in here and get it drawn and then you'll have that here.

DOCTOR Q561
Right, yep, nothing after midnight and then come in here.  You know where you get it checked.

PATIENT Q561
Yeah, yeah I know where I need to go.

DOCTOR Q561
Yeah because I know you were hospitalized at St. Francis a little while ago.

PATIENT Q561
That's cause I was given some metformin.

DOCTOR Q561
Yeah.

PATIENT Q561
It was too strong for me.

DOCTOR Q561
Okay.

PATIENT Q561
It was too strong, it was 850 mg and it bothered my, I think the doctor said my liver or my kidneys one and when I got in the hospital he said no it no good for you which is, it was bothering me because it was sending me to the bathroom every hour, before the hour.

DOCTOR Q561
Hmm.

PATIENT Q561
Forceful urination.

DOCTOR Q561
Okay.

PATIENT Q561
And then it finally of dehydrated me so I had to go to the Emergency Room at St. Francis cause the ambulance took me to the closest hospital to my house.

DOCTOR Q561
Did they check your sugars then?  Did they see how high those were?

PATIENT Q561
I think they checked everything.

DOCTOR Q561
Okay.

PATIENT Q561
Otherwise they would've let me go.

DOCTOR Q561
So now what are you taking for your blood sugars?

PATIENT Q561
Glipizide and then metformin.

DOCTOR Q561
Oh you're still taking the metformin.

PATIENT Q561
But only at that lower dosage cause you she me 850 mg and when I told them it made me sick, they changed me down to 450.

DOCTOR Q561
Okay.

PATIENT Q561
That's what she did and its better but it's still almost like the same thing cause I have to go, it won't let me hold, I can't hold.

DOCTOR Q561
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q561
No water, I have to go.  It don't matter where I'm at.

DOCTOR Q561
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q561
It's like that feeling come on I have to go.

DOCTOR Q561
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q561
And it come out, that's how those pills, some pills do me.  For some reason, I don't know why.

DOCTOR Q561
So yeah, you know everybody reacts differently to medications.  Most of my patients who have diabetes are on 1000 of metformin twice a day.  That's the regular dose.

PATIENT Q561
I don't think it's too strong for anybody.

DOCTOR Q561
No it's actually, I mean it.

PATIENT Q561
I guess it all depends on how your sugars is running.

DOCTOR Q561
Oh it depends on your sugars.

PATIENT Q561
Yeah cause mine are running @@@@ high.

DOCTOR Q561
They're not running that @@@

PATIENT Q561
Yeah so that's what I'm saying.

DOCTOR Q561
Yeah absolutely, it depends on your sugars.  We don't want to drop your sugars too low and then um it really depends on each person and how they react to the medication.  You know in general metformin is one that a lot of people do tend to tolerate but everybody's different so you know you might have had urinary frequency from that.  A lot of times blood sugars being high can cause urinary frequency too.

PATIENT Q561
But like I said I been controlling my sugars.

DOCTOR Q561
Good, good.

PATIENT Q561
And the thing is she took me off of insulin and said I shouldn't be taking insulin which I been taking insulin all along and put me on the metformin.  Uh the metformin, the dose that she gave me was too strong.

DOCTOR Q561
Okay, good.

PATIENT Q561
Because it was like sending me to the bathroom, just automatically just hurried up and ended me sending me to the bathroom and I never went to the bathroom that many times like that there and then finally it dehydrated me cause it just really dehydrates you.

DOCTOR Q561
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q561
And I’m sitting at home and boom I got dehydrated and almost passed out.

DOCTOR Q561
So you're okay on the 500?

PATIENT Q561
Uh 450 yeah, I'm better with it, 450 you know.

DOCTOR Q561
Okay.

PATIENT Q561
Cause if it was bothering me I wouldn't want to take that either.  I mean I don't need to take something that makes me sick or make me go to the bathroom.

DOCTOR Q561
Yeah.  Well um, let me see, so what I want to do is to check your cholesterol and I'm also gonna check your sugars and how they're being controlled.

PATIENT Q561
Okay.

DOCTOR Q561
Um do you test your sugars at home?

PATIENT Q561
Sometimes I do, I stopped doing it for a while because you know that's two fingers every day and them fingers.

DOCTOR Q561
@@@.

PATIENT Q561
And them fingers, see all the marks on my fingertips there.

DOCTOR Q561
Absolutely.

PATIENT Q561
Cause I just learn, the new nurses that uh at Cabrini showed me how to do it from the side so it don't you know cause I usually doing the tips, that's what I was taught to prick the tips, now I know to do the sides.

DOCTOR Q561
Yeah.

PATIENT Q561
But you see all the marks, because I been doing it for awhile. I mean I said I feel great I mean.  I aint’ feeling bad, I don't think I be having to draw, taking that sugar every day.

DOCTOR Q561
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q561
But if you want me to take it every other day or something like then give you the results, I can do that.

DOCTOR Q561
Yeah you know if it's stable every other day, every couple days then that's fine.

PATIENT Q561
Then what, so what, how high should the sugar go?

DOCTOR Q561
After you eat.

PATIENT Q561
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q561
It's okay for it to go to 150-160.

PATIENT Q561
Okay after I eat but before I eat, I usually take it before I eat.

DOCTOR Q561
Yeah before you eat I tend to like to see it 110 and below.

PATIENT Q561
110 and below.

DOCTOR Q561
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q561
Okay, okay.  110 and below.

DOCTOR Q561
But the test that I'm gonna do is going to check your blood sugars and how they've been controlled over the past three months, it's a test that kind of can see how it's been over the past month to three months.

PATIENT Q561
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q561
So we'll get a better idea.

PATIENT Q561
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR Q561
Um let's see.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT Q561
Yes.

DOCTOR Q561
When was that?  Oh actually I see it here, oh it was 2010.

PATIENT Q561
I had a couple of those and the other one go down through my throat too.

DOCTOR Q561
And in 2010 it looks like.

PATIENT Q561
I had triple bypass, I had a gallbladder taken out, what else.  That's about it, the triple bypass and gallbladder taken out.  I don't have no gallbladder or whatever cause she said I had too many kidney stones and they had to take the bladder.  

DOCTOR Q561
So you're good, cause they didn't see any precancerous tumors or anything in the colonoscopy.

PATIENT Q561
Right, it was clear.

DOCTOR Q561
So that's good.

PATIENT Q561
It was all clear, no polyps, no none of that other stuff.

DOCTOR Q561
Good.

PATIENT Q561
It was clear.

DOCTOR Q561
Good, good.

PATIENT Q561
Both times it was clear.

DOCTOR Q561
Good.  And then have you had the influenza shot this year?

PATIENT Q561
She told me to come back and uh, she told me to come back when December?

DOCTOR Q561
No it looks like you had it.

PATIENT Q561
I had it in March but she said it's time to take another one so, she said it was time to take another one so to come back in a month or so and take another one.

DOCTOR Q561
Okay.

PATIENT Q561
She said it due, unless you want me to take it today before I leave up out of here I mean.

DOCTOR Q561
She wants you to take it today?

PATIENT Q561
No, no, no, if you want me to.  She said come back and do it.

DOCTOR Q561
Oh.

PATIENT Q561
That's what she told me to come back and do it.

DOCTOR Q561
March was a bit early to get it so um you can get it done today, that's fine.

PATIENT Q561
So where do I go get that at?

DOCTOR Q561
You can just go to the nurse who checked you in.

PATIENT Q561
And she'll give it to me?

DOCTOR Q561
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q561
Oh okay, that's good.

DOCTOR Q561
And then it looks like all your medications are good through the next year.  All the refills that you need.

PATIENT Q561
Yeah all the refills.  Cause the only thing I really had run out of was uh stool softeners, my wife who uses them too.

DOCTOR Q561
Oh it looks like you have enough now, but do you need some more?

PATIENT Q561

DOCTOR Q561

PATIENT Q561
So the ones you buy at the store are like, you go to the store like Dominic's, they ain't no good?

DOCTOR Q561
Docusate, no they're good too but I'm just saying there are different kinds of stool softeners but at the same time you have to make sure you know the medication is what it is.  Is it prescribed to her or was it over-the-counter?

PATIENT Q561
