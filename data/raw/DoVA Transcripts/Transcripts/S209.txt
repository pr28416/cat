(DOCTOR OUT:  11:54  DOCTOR IN:  22:09)

DOCTOR S209
So you're saying you take the gout pills twice a month and you just take one pill twice a month?

PATIENT S209
No.

DOCTOR S209
Then what?

PATIENT S209
They changed it back to three.

DOCTOR S209
Okay.

PATIENT S209
Three pills.

DOCTOR S209
And that takes care of it when you have a gout attack?

PATIENT S209
It supposed, come sometimes it cools it off.

DOCTOR S209
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S209
But it didn't stop it all the time.

DOCTOR S209
Okay.  And have you ever been on a medicine that you take every day to help prevent gout attacks?

PATIENT S209
No.

DOCTOR S209
Um because there's a medicine called allopurinol that you can take one pill every day and it's supposed to help decrease the amount of uric acid in your body and uric acid is what causes gout attacks.

PATIENT S209
Oh.

DOCTOR S209
Would you like to start that pill to take to help prevent the gout attacks?  It’s one pill once a day and it helps your kidneys get rid of some of that extra uric acid in the body and that uric acid is what gets in your joints and can cause the gout flares.

PATIENT S209
Yeah.

DOCTOR S209
But it is one more pill you'd have to take every day.  It's not just the pill that you take when you have the gout attack.

PATIENT S209
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S209
It something you take every single day.

PATIENT S209
Okay, yeah.

DOCTOR S209
Okay and you want to pick it up today?

PATIENT S209
Yeah.

DOCTOR S209
Alright.

PATIENT S209
I want the magnesium.

DOCTOR S209
And the magnesium also.

PATIENT S209
Yeah.

DOCTOR S209
Okay.  Are those the only ones you're gonna pick up today?

PATIENT S209
Yeah.

DOCTOR S209
Okay.  So let me do that first.  Okay so those medicines will be at the Pharmacy today.

PATIENT S209
Okay.

DOCTOR S209
And let me go through all your other medicines and make sure you have enough refills left so you can call for it.  Okay.  Okay so it'll be at the Pharmacy.

PATIENT S209
Okay.

DOCTOR S209
And you don't need the shot.  You don't need a tetanus shot because you had one in 2003.

PATIENT S209
Okay oh.

DOCTOR S209
Okay so you got the tetanus shot, just eight years ago and you don't need a booster.

PATIENT S209
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR S209
So you're gonna continue all your medicines and start this new one.  It's called allopurinol.

PATIENT S209
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S209
Just one pill once a day.
