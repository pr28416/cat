FIRST DOCTOR A980
Alright PATIENT how is everything going?

PATIENT A980
Uh, just got out of the hospital last month.  I had pneumonia.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay and are you feeling okay since then?  Feeling better recently?

PATIENT A980
Well, when I was going to therapy on my left leg here for eight weeks.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
Strengthen my leg.  I've been having trouble getting up and down the stairs and now the thing is getting worse again.  This leg is swollen compared to this one.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  So is that what's bothering you the most right now?  The pain in the leg?  Swelling.

PATIENT A980
Well, just arthritis and then you know they told me years ago I had this pinched nerve in the middle of my back and I've been getting a lot of pain in my back.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A980
And I've been going to the chiropractor twice a week.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
And uh I mean it helped for a short time and then it always just goes right back to what has so, I don't know if this thing is you know they told me at the time oh it's not serious enough to operate or nothing.  You know just stand the pain and uh you know keep up with it as long as you can.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
So I don't know how that's going.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Well, let me ask you.  Do you feel like the pain is still something you can tolerate or not?

PATIENT A980
Well I can tolerate the pain but I don't know, I have this pain here and just on this left side.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
And it feels a little swollen on my back here and the pain goes all the way through to my abdomen.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Now is that new?

PATIENT A980
That's been going on for about three months.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Three months okay.  Um let's see, you last saw DOCTOR in December of last year.

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
And you know I was reading through his note and you do have significant degenerative changes in the spine and I'm sure you know that.  You had that uh sort of a trauma back in 2007 and since.

PATIENT A980
Well you know I've got degenerative arthritis.  I've got arthritis in every joint in my body so you know, I gotta put up with a lot of pain every day so what's the difference you know.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Um right now are you still taking this diclofenac?

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Are you also taking Tylenol?

PATIENT A980
No Tylenol's off the market so I just been taking aspirin.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Tylenol is off the market?

PATIENT A980
Yeah they pulled it.  They had some mold or something in the tablets or something so they had to pull it.

DOCTOR A980
Oh really.

PATIENT A980
Yeah they haven't been on the stands; they haven't been selling it now for six months or so.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  So what are you taking for the pain right now?

PATIENT A980
Just aspirin every now and then and the diclofenac and that's it.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  How long have you been without the Tylenol?

PATIENT A980
Well like I said for at least six months anyway.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Six months okay.  So yeah that's interesting.  Before we had you on two medications for the pain and now you're only on one so I want to get you back on something to help with that.  Because this is a chronic condition.

PATIENT A980
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Um what I want to ask you though is have you had any new weakness in your legs?

PATIENT A980
Well just, well I don't well my whole left side is messed up.  My left hip, my knee, everything hurts. 

DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
And it's just; everything seems to be on the left side, even this pain in the back and everything else.  Everything's on the left side.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
So NAME since this is my first time meeting you, has that always been the case.  Has the left side always been like that?

PATIENT A980
It seems that way yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay, alright.  But has your leg been giving out underneath you?

PATIENT A980
Uh well, sometimes it hasn't really given out but sometimes it feels like it's gonna bend in the other direction.  You know it just hurts real, sharp pain in the knee or something you know.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Have you had any problems with falls in the last year?

PATIENT A980
No except I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom like I usually do because I got an enlarged prostate you know so.  I fell asleep on the john.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
I was there for an hour and a half and then I tried to stand up and my left leg wouldn't work anymore.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  An hour and a half on the toilet will do that.

PATIENT A980
Yeah I guess so.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Alright so no falls.  Do you use a cane or a walker?

PATIENT A980
No.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Or anything like that?

PATIENT A980
No, no.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Do you have a problem climbing stairs?

PATIENT A980
Well I was, like I said I was having trouble before when I was going for therapy.  I was having trouble going upstairs and that's where our bathroom and bath is and everything, it's upstairs so I have to get up there and.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Has therapy helped you get better over time?

PATIENT A980
Oh yeah I was doing good you know with the therapy uh yeah and after eight weeks no then they cleared me and I've been doing the stretching exercises at home and everything and uh just that little climbing the stair bit they had me but I think I should be getting back on the bicycle again because my knee is really starting to bother me again and like I said it's getting swollen.  It's all swollen on this side here like I don't know.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Do you know, I'm gonna do, in a little bit I will take a look at the legs.

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
But I think in the meantime it's probably gonna be good to have you get back on the Tylenol and um if you would like I can have you pick up the Tylenol today from the Pharmacy.

PATIENT A980
Oh they can just mail it to me.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Mail it at home okay, that's perfect.

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
So we'll go ahead and do that uh and I will take a look at, I will take a look at the leg in just a minute.  Uh what I also want to do while I have you here is just go over some of your other, sort of more chronic problems, just to sort of touch base, let you know how everything's going.  So the diabetes um I know I read DOCTOR's note that he was actually, he felt that it was well controlled with diet and last time, that's exactly what happened is you made the dietary, the lifestyle changes and your A1c went from 7.1 that's been 2009 down to 6.4 which was in December so that's perfect.

PATIENT A980
Well I went and had a test this morning.  I don't know if you got any results of it yet but.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Yeah I actually put those orders in this morning so I'll go over those as well.  Uh so usually when you are diabetic we like to look at the kidneys to make sure that everything is okay so we took a urine sample this morning and those test results are perfect.  So those numbers look good.  Your diabetes was never really out of control so I don't expect a lot of damage to the kidneys so that's great.  Your A1c today, which just sort of tells us how well your sugars have been controlled over the last few months.

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Was 6.6 so you were at 7.1 and you controlled it with the diet, it went down to 6.4, now you're at 6.6 which is a good number but I want you to keep working on the dietary changes and being active.

PATIENT A980
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
So being active, I ain't too good at being active I'll tell you.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
I'm hoping that if we get you on something for pain you know we can get you moving around a little bit more.  Going to Physical Therapy I mean that does have @@@.

PATIENT A980
Well yeah well I'm done with that now and but you know like I said before, well the doctor at Physical Therapy he actually gave me a prescription to go get this test, what a cloda something or other.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
The, is it an ultrasound to see if there was blood clots in the leg?

PATIENT A980
Well I forgot what he called it.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Oh claudication?

PATIENT A980
Yeah claudication.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
And up here's somewhere, leading down into my legs.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
Because I told him I don't have any stamina anymore.  You know when we went through the mall we could hit all four stores you know.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
And now I'm lucky if I can do two.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Did you have that study done here then?

PATIENT A980
I didn't have it done at all yet.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
You didn't have it done at all?

PATIENT A980
No.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
See if there's.  This was your doctor outside the VA.

PATIENT A980
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  That's something @@@.

PATIENT A980
The therapy place yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
I still have the prescription at home.  I mean you could, he didn't care where I had it done.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  Let me ask you, when you walk do you get a burning cramping pain in your legs?

PATIENT A980
Well my feet, my feet burn.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
And uh they hurt you know.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
When you rest how long does it take for that to go away?

PATIENT A980
Oh pretty quickly.  It doesn't take long.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Doesn't take long okay.  When I take a look at your legs I'll sort of see what the pulses feel like and if it looks like that's something you might need done um then we can do it here.  But I'll take a look in just a moment.

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
But just going back to the other lab work that you had done, your electrolytes were fine.  Your lipid panel, you didn't eat this morning right?

PATIENT A980
No when I took it.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
They told me to fast so.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
No everything was great.  Triglycerides were fine, cholesterol was great.  Your bad cholesterol was low.  Your good cholesterol was also a little bit low um.  Your liver function tests were okay.  So mainly more or less things look great.  Alright.

PATIENT A980
Yeah I'm gonna live forever.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
So let's see, we got the lipids done, so we got the A1c and you know I think for you having your sugars being in the 6.5-7 range is appropriate.

PATIENT A980
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
So you're right there.  I'm not gonna change your medications right now.

PATIENT A980
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Um the other thing I wanted to talk to you about is the VA has started this new policy where regardless of your past medical history and regardless of your past personal history, they want all veterans to be screened for HIV and it's a simple blood test that we would do.  Since you've already had your labs done today I'll add it on to your next lab draw.

PATIENT A980
Fine.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Is that okay?

PATIENT A980
I don't care.  I don't have it so I don't care, it doesn't matter to me.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Let's go ahead and go through your.

PATIENT A980
I haven't been sexually active in a long time.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Well it's just a policy, they just want to cover and test everyone.  So I want to go over some of the meds that you have at home.  Are you taking the Combivent, the inhaler?

PATIENT A980
Yeah, no not that, no I just, all I'm taking is the albuterol that's it.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  Just the albuterol by itself?

PATIENT A980
That's it, nothing else.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  So there's, that inhaler that I'm talking about has two medications in it.  It has albuterol and another medication so we call it a Combivent cause it's a combination.

PATIENT A980
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
So is that the same one or is this?

PATIENT A980
No it's just the one you put, uh just the albuterol that's all.  I don't even have that on my list what you're talking about.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Can I take a look?

PATIENT A980
Sure.

DOCTOR A980
Okay it should be the one at a time.

PATIENT A980
And this is just the albuterol.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay, oh see this right here, albuterol and then this is ipratropium.

PATIENT A980
Oh okay, alright.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
And then it's with the ipratropium.

PATIENT A980
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Do you use that uh every day?

PATIENT A980
Yeah uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
How's your breathing been?  Have you had any shortness of breath, cough?

PATIENT A980
Only when I go out and exert myself.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
You know.  I uh of course that's my own fault anyway.  I go out in the yard and might start something.  I won't quit until I'm done.  I won't even go in the house and get a drink.  I get dehydrated out there and everything else and I'm a big you know.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Have you ever had to go to the hospital for breathing problems with that?

PATIENT A980
No, no.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  Ever had to go to the Emergency Department for breathing problems?

PATIENT A980
No, no.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  And then um do you feel like your chest was tight or that you were weaker?

PATIENT A980
No not really uh uh and it doesn't, you know it doesn't wake me up during the night or nothing you know just you know.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
So they told me that I'm a borderline COPD or something whatever.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay, then it looks like it's fairly well controlled.  You've never had any problems.

PATIENT A980
No.  It doesn't give me any problems at all.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Yeah.  So the other thing is you're on a statin which is a medication you take for your cholesterol.

PATIENT A980
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  And then terazosin which is for the prostate.

PATIENT A980
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  You're also on a medication called clonazepam.

PATIENT A980
That's for my restless leg.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Yeah restless leg.  And I know DOCTOR talked to you about this in the past, uh sleep apnea and getting a sleep study done.

PATIENT A980
I had one done a long time ago uh.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
How long is a long time ago?

PATIENT A980
Oh God, I was still working then so that had to be maybe 15 years ago may, maybe even later than 20 and that.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  So um I know he talked to you about it in the past but I think that it's an important study to get.

PATIENT A980
Well uh I don't know what, it'll probably just show the same thing that I have sleep apnea and I uh.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Do you have the machine for it?

PATIENT A980
No I don't use any machines.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay you don't.  So I think the machine is actually, it's another one of those things where it's just gonna take you a little bit of time to get used to it but once you start using it regularly, not only will your sleeping get better your restless leg will improve.

PATIENT A980
I don't have any trouble sleeping.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
You don't?

PATIENT A980
No I sleep like a log.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Do you wake up refreshed in the morning?

PATIENT A980
I don't know about refreshed but I know I'll get up maybe three times a night to go to the washroom, that's the only thing that wakes me up and as soon as I lay back down boom I'm out like a light.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  Is it only at night that you have to get up to go to the bathroom a lot?  Are you going to the bathroom a lot during the day?

PATIENT A980
I do.  I go to the bathroom a lot, all day long.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
All day long okay.

PATIENT A980
Yeah all day long.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
Uh but like I said I don't have any trouble breathing at night.  It doesn't bother me, doesn't wake me up, it doesn't do anything.  I mean it's never bothered me.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
You know so I don't know why I would need a machine at all.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Um I was just, I wouldn't give you the machine, I would just recommend you go back and have the study done to make sure that the sleep apnea is not too severe cause if it is.

PATIENT A980
The only thing that bothers me uh is if my nose gets stuffed up.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Your nose gets stuffed up.

PATIENT A980
Because I'm a mouth, my nose was busted.  I got, this side is completely closed off as it is.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
So everything drains on this side and it just clogs up.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Alright.

PATIENT A980
And then I have trouble breathing.  I gotta get up and then I'll shoot some of that stuff they gave me to put in my nose and clear it out you know.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  Let's get you to sitting up here; I'll take a look at your legs okay.

PATIENT A980
But I sleep like I’m dead.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
@@@,

PATIENT A980
No I'm serious.  I can't hear anything when I'm sleeping.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
I'm out.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
I'll just start with the simple stuff.  I just want to listen to your heart, relax now.  Make sure you're not wheezing today.  Any uh chest pain or pressing pain?

PATIENT A980
No.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Any shortness of breath?

PATIENT A980
No.  Oh boy that sounded good.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Alright just breathe normally for right now.  Okay.  I'll just take a listen when you're laying flat.  I'll have you take a deep breath.  Okay.  Again and again.  And again, one more okay.  Sit up for me.  I'll just have you put your shirt over here.  Alright, let me just pull your legs around and I'll lay you flat.

PATIENT A980
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
It's okay, don't be alarmed.

PATIENT A980
Yeah I know that it's just.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
While you're standing, try this way.  Good.  

PATIENT A980
And I also got a hiatal hernia so.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Hiatal hernia or a ventral hernia?

PATIENT A980
Well whatever it is, it's.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
This right here?

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay, alright.  Have you ever been a smoker PATIENT?

PATIENT A980
Oh yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT A980
No.  I quit just over 13 years ago.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Good.  You’re telling me the left leg is more swollen?

PATIENT A980
Oh yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Hmm.

PATIENT A980
Right around the knee.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Right around the knee okay.  We may have to ask you to get to drop your pants.

PATIENT A980
Oh @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Go ahead.  Stay as you are right now for just one second.  Alright push my hands away, pull them forward, alright.  Step down on my hands like you're stepping on the gas pedal, good, up the other way.  Go ahead and @@@.

PATIENT A980
That's more swollen than this one is.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
You're not having to sit with your legs crossed right?  You alright?

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Can you lift this knee up off the table?  Lift it up @@@.  Where do you have most of the pain?

PATIENT A980
Well it seems to be on this side right in here.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
And uh down this calf, the muscle down in this calf.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  Right here?

PATIENT A980
Yeah about lower, like in front, it just runs down the length of the calf.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  Alright.  Let's go ahead and @@@.  So what I saw in that leg is that usually what happens is if there's problems with the blood vessels um first of all the leg becomes really cold, you start losing hair and the skin starts to thin out over the shins and I don't see any of that.  Uh one is since your diabetes again was never really out of control and you do have a nice pulses behind the knee as well so I'm not too concerned about this being a vascular problem.  I think this is just, based on where you're telling me you have some pain I think it's just arthritis and degenerative changes.

PATIENT A980
Well yeah he told me that you know, he says you got the growling in your knee it's all you know.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Huh, growling in your knee I like that.

PATIENT A980
Yeah whatever, something like that he said.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  So let's.

PATIENT A980
Popcorn or something.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Let's do this, let's get you back on the Tylenol and see if that helps okay.

PATIENT A980
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
And then we'll keep up with the physical therapy and the exercises okay.

PATIENT A980
Okay.  But like I said I got that bike at home I can ride and then I do the stretching exercises every day and I do the going down the stairs.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
You know another thing that will help and it will help the diabetes and it will also help the knee is just continued weight loss.

PATIENT A980
Oh I'd love to lose weight believe me.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
So you've been kind of stable for the last two years.

PATIENT A980
Yeah I know.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
I don't, I don't change weight much at all.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Did they ever give you a brochure on the MOVE Program that we have here for veterans?

PATIENT A980
Yeah they told me something about it.  You know it's just getting here.  I live a long way from here.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  Alright, well I'll give you one more chance to sort of try it on your own and if the weight doesn't get lost then I think we'll try to be a little more aggressive alright.  But then if we get you on the Tylenol I'm hoping that you'll be a little more active.

PATIENT A980
There's, I'm allergic to fish.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
So I can't eat fish.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Allergic to fish.

PATIENT A980
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
Everything with me is a Catch 22, I'm telling you cause you know like Naprosyn they said oh that's wonderful for your arthritis, I'm allergic to that.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Oh alright.

PATIENT A980
I can't take it.  I took one Aleve tablet and I was watching TV, said it's great for arthritis.  I said oh I'll go get some.  I took one tablet they took me to the hospital.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay.  @@@  Um again the last thing for you is just the flu shot that's coming out next week, probably next week so just to make sure you get it when it becomes available.

PATIENT A980
Oh I got a pneumonia shot while I was in the hospital so you don't have to worry about that.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Oh so you already did that okay that's what I was going check on.

PATIENT A980
Yeah it's all done now but the flu shot that's fine.  I get one every year when I come here so.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Alright.  I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR real quick.

PATIENT A980
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
My supervising physician and make sure that there's not anything else that she wants to discuss with you.  Do you have any questions for me right now?

PATIENT A980
No not really.  I just uh wish they would take a closer look at these lists every now and then because I called up for my medicine the other day and they said that's expired, that's expired, that's.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Which one's expired?

PATIENT A980
Oh none of them now, they.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Oh they're okay now okay.

PATIENT A980
Yeah.  None of them now they but I'm saying how can they be expired already geez.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Okay so I'll be right back okay.  If you think of anything keep it in mind.  You'll have another opportunity to ask all the questions you want.

PATIENT A980
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Alright.  @@@ take care okay.

PATIENT A980
You too.  You see I figure he's got to come @@@.

And uh I'm not crazy about fowl.  I'll eat it every now and then but I couldn't make a steady diet out of it no how.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah.

PATIENT A980

I'm a meat and potatoes guy and that's it.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Meat and potatoes okay.  Um yeah so just cut back.  It's about portion control.

PATIENT A980
Right.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
You know cutting back, watching your calories at the end of the day.  You know you need to put in less burn up more and you know create a negative balance right.

PATIENT A980
Uh-huh.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Um and so you can lose some weight, especially you know around the waste area.

PATIENT A980
Yeah I know.  I would love to lose this believe me.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Easier said than done right.  Um but you know, continue to work at it you know.

PATIENT A980
Well like I was telling him, my arthritis is so bad.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah.

PATIENT A980
You know uh and I just don't have the stamina to go very far anymore.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah.

PATIENT A980
If we go to the mall like I told him, I could go to all four main stores and walk the whole mall, now I can't even do two.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah.

PATIENT A980
You know and it's just, I'm so happy to get back to the car and sit down my legs are hurting so bad you know I just can't, can't do it anymore.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah, right, right.  So we want to you know put you back on Tylenol.  The Tylenol is also a very mild pain reliever.

PATIENT A980
Right.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
I'm gonna be honest with you, I don't know if it's gonna really doing a lot and help your pain a whole lot.

PATIENT A980
Oh I don't expect to.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
But, try it you know, see if it does.  If not we can you know put stronger pain pills like tramadol which is like a narcotic.

PATIENT A980
Yeah I've had those before but that you know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Tylenol #3, you know Vicodin.

PATIENT A980
Uh-huh.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Um you know those type of pain medicines.

PATIENT A980
Like I was telling him, anything with Naprosyn in it.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
He @@@.

PATIENT A980
I'm allergic to; I can't take anything to do with that.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay.  So but again try Tylenol.  If it doesn't help because I want you to be active.  You know everything has its balance right.  You don't want to be in too much pain.  At the same time you take so much medication you're getting the side effects and you know, you may be walking like a zombie all the time.  So you have to have a balance.  You take enough pain medicine so you can function.

PATIENT A980
Okay, I understand.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
So you are walking better.  You're able to enjoy your life.  You're outdoors you know.

PATIENT A980
Well you know I do, I do all the grocery shopping.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
You know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah.

PATIENT A980
And when I'm out it takes me five hours to do the grocery shopping so I'm on my feet for five hours.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Hmm.

PATIENT A980
Straight.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Alright.

PATIENT A980
You know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT A980
So.  I go and even though it was five, I must go to six different stores just cause I'm walking around in there in all the aisles and waiting in line and so I'm on my feet quite a bit.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Like a.

PATIENT A980
You know but that's only one day a week I do that.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah.

PATIENT A980
But then I'm out in the yard doing yard work, picking up you know branches.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah.

PATIENT A980
And everything.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah, yeah.  So just do you know a little at a time and just several times a day so at least you're getting some activity, continue doing that so do the same. It looks like you’re doing that.  The problem of sleep apnea, I'm getting the story that you were diagnosed with sleep apnea at some point in your life?

PATIENT A980
Yeah a long time ago, that was.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Was it here?

PATIENT A980
No that was at uh Presbyterian Hospital I think.  That's when I was smoking way back then you know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay.  Did you lose a significant amount of weight since then?

PATIENT A980
I, like I said I don't have any trouble sleeping at all.  I sleep like a log.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
I don't have any; you know not breathing doesn't wake me up.  Just having to go to the bathroom wakes me up that's it.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
But I slept you know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Do you sleep well?

PATIENT A980
I slept you know, I sleep.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Good sleep.

PATIENT A980
If I get up to go to the bathroom I can lay down and I'll be back asleep in an instant, poof I'm out.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
You know, I don't have any trouble.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
How do you feel in the morning?  Do you feel rested?

PATIENT A980
No not really because I, that's my own fault.  I don't go to bed early.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Hmm.

PATIENT A980
I don't go to bed till almost 1 o'clock in the morning.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A980
And then I get up at 6, 7.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
I see.

PATIENT A980
I got maybe five hours of sleep, that's all I get.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Do you fall asleep easily during the day?

PATIENT A980
Oh yeah.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
@@@.

PATIENT A980
I sit in the chair.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Do you ever feel like, if you @@@ then you would fall asleep right?

PATIENT A980
Well not no, not if I'm waiting for something I'll stay awake you know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
You do.

PATIENT A980
But if I'm, if I'm sitting there trying to read.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A980
Or do a crossword puzzle I'll just nod off you know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
You doze off okay.  The reason we are testing that is it's not, it's because sleep apnea it's just not, it's not just about not able to sleep.

PATIENT A980
Uh-huh I know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
So people may feel they're getting good sleep and still can have profound severe sleep apnea.  They may not realize it.  The only symptom they know is why am I not getting you know why don't I feel rested you know.

PATIENT A980
No I don't feel rested because I don't get enough sleep.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah it could very well be just that but because of your history of diagnosed sleep apnea it's very much possible that you still have it okay unless you lose like 50-60 pounds.

PATIENT A980
Yeah well I would love to lose 50-60 pounds believe me.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
No, no, no, what I'm saying is did you lose that much weight since it was diagnosed several years ago?

PATIENT A980
Oh no I put on weight since then.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Since then okay then it's unlikely to go away okay.

PATIENT A980
Uh-huh.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
So I strongly suggest that we repeat the sleep study only because untreated severe sleep apnea can increase mortality.

PATIENT A980
Oh I understand that yeah.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
You have death from sudden heart attack or dyspnea.

PATIENT A980
Right.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
And stroke.

PATIENT A980
I know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
It's a serious disease and if untreated can lead to heart disease and high blood pressure.

PATIENT A980
Right.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Very very serious.

PATIENT A980
Uh-huh.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Disease.  Not just about sleep and things like that.

PATIENT A980
Right.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
So we take that very seriously and in the end because you know, so @@@.

PATIENT A980
You want another test I don't care.  See the test they gave me is they just attached all of this stuff to me in my home.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Oh you were at home okay.

PATIENT A980
Yeah, yeah I just slept overnight at home and then I brought the monitoring thing back to them.  They had me all wired up to this machine you know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay, yeah.  Uh we actually do it here.

PATIENT A980
Right.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
You come here for the night.  We are testing you and they monitor you all night see how you sleep and record all those things.  I think that would be a good thing for you alright.  So we'll go ahead and do it, get one.

PATIENT A980
Alright.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
They have a long waiting list so it's not going to be scheduled for a few weeks so we'll take it from there then.

PATIENT A980
Okay.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay, alright, very good.  Anything else?

PATIENT A980
Well, like I told him before I had this pain in my back here that goes all the way through to my abdomen and I been going to the chiropractor twice a week.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Hmm.

PATIENT A980
But it's not going away and this side right here feels a little swollen to me.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Hmm.

PATIENT A980
And uh I don't know what it is.  Now when I was in the hospital for my pneumonia last month they took a CT scan and there's no cancer in my lungs or nothing you know and uh afterwards, after I got out I had another chest x-ray and they said all the pneumonia was gone and everything but and then too if I pressed into my stomach here I feel pain.  When anybody else presses in I don't feel nothing, only when I press it.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Why do you think that is?

PATIENT A980
And I don't know why but maybe I could press the right spot I don't know what it is but it.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
How long have you had that for?

PATIENT A980
Oh about three months.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Hmm.

PATIENT A980
And I don't know what it is but, anyway it's not going away whatever it is.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Hmm.  Do you still have it?

PATIENT A980
Yeah right now.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Right now?  Okay did you?

FIRST DOCTOR A980
I didn't get anything on exam.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
I didn't @@@.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah.  What was his @@@ last time.  @@@.

PATIENT A980
I was you know.  I was always just worried about my kidneys failing because my dad died of that you know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Your kidneys are completely fine, don't worry about that.

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
Yeah that's what he's told me anyway.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah, yeah.  Could be a muscle strain maybe you know um.

PATIENT A980
Well it hurts when I walk.  You know I can feel it you know.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
@@@ uh-huh okay.

PATIENT A980
That muscle right here hurts when I walk.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
That muscle hurts?

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Is it painful when I'm pressing, is it tender a little bit?

PATIENT A980
A little bit yeah.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
A little bit okay.  And it goes all the way in here?

PATIENT A980
Well I can feel it in my abdomen too yeah.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay, okay.  Um any change in your bowel habits, constipation, or diarrhea?

PATIENT A980
Oh I was constipated for, oh by the way I was just looking at my list and stool softener I have no refills left on that at all.

FIRST DOCTOR A980 
I already refilled those.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah.

PATIENT A980
Because all the medication I take makes me constipated.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Yeah.

PATIENT A980
And so I was taking the stool softener you know and.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Does it help?

PATIENT A980
Well now they prescribed that uh you know whatever's in the yogurt I don't know what.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Hmm.

FIRST DOCTOR A980
Probiotic.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Probiotic?

PATIENT A980
Yeah.

THIRD DOCTOR A980
Okay.

PATIENT A980
Take a probiotic plus the stool softener and.

THIRD DOCTOR A980

PATIENT A980

THIRD DOCTOR A980

PATIENT A980
