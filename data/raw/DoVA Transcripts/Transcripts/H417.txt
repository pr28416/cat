DOCTOR H417
I have the nurse; I don't see the note from DOCTOR.  I see the PFT Report and that was in July, the function tests.

PATIENT H417
Okay.  Maybe he didn't add anything.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
Cause uh there wasn't really nothing for them to do.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  Okay I see.

PATIENT H417
You see it?

DOCTOR H417
Yep.

PATIENT H417
Okay.

DOCTOR H417
Okay I see it.  Okay so you have a couple issues.  It looks like the diabetes is also a major issue correct?  Okay.  Let me just @@@.

PATIENT H417
So far it's been pretty good.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
I been testing myself.

DOCTOR H417
Now what are you on for your diabetes?

PATIENT H417
Um I @@@, glypid, glyper, G I don't know how to pronounce it.

DOCTOR H417
Glipizide?

PATIENT H417
Glipizide and um, oh the metformin yeah.

DOCTOR H417
You're on metformin.  Good and I was reading from DOCTOR said you were having some trouble with the metformin?

PATIENT H417
Yeah I was.

DOCTOR H417
But.

PATIENT H417
But it went away.  I was experiencing headaches with it.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
But as it got into my system I wasn't experiencing any more headaches and I been testing myself and uh been pretty good.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
Like when I get up in the morning I test myself and sometimes it's like 95, 115.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
Yeah.

DOCTOR H417
Good.

PATIENT H417
And I you know I been testing myself like two hours after I eat.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
It's like 140.

DOCTOR H417
Really?

PATIENT H417
Yeah.

DOCTOR H417
That's not bad.

PATIENT H417
Yeah I know so.  It's been @@@ .  He had told me to take uh, he told me to take a half a pill, half of it, so I took half.

DOCTOR H417
So you're taking half of.

PATIENT H417
No I take a whole one now.

DOCTOR H417
So you take okay.

PATIENT H417
I take a whole one.  Well that glipizide I was wondering is that necessary to take along with that metformin?

DOCTOR H417
It should be and I think the reason they did that was because your sugar wasn't very well controlled.

PATIENT H417
Yeah.

DOCTOR H417
Uh and that's why so last time.

PATIENT H417
But he no this I was taking the glipizide and he said because my sugar was uncontrolled he added the metformin.

DOCTOR H417
Yeah.  So you're taking metformin, you're taking glipizide, you're taking 20 twice a day right?  20 mg?

PATIENT H417
Well actually I'm taking only 10.

DOCTOR H417
Okay 10 okay.

PATIENT H417
I'm taking 10.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
Along with the metformin.

DOCTOR H417
Okay and uh metformin what 500 twice a day okay.

PATIENT H417
Right, right.

DOCTOR H417
And then and you're taking that every day?

PATIENT H417
Yes.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
Yeah.

DOCTOR H417
Every, every day without fail and your blood sugars when you wake up in the morning are around?

PATIENT H417
They tend to.

DOCTOR H417
What number?

PATIENT H417
Fluctuate maybe 95, 115 or so I guess.

DOCTOR H417
So that's very good.  Is that better than it has been in the past?  A lot better cause it.

PATIENT H417
Cause when I was waking it was like 150.

DOCTOR H417
Okay, okay.  Now you said two hours after you eat it's how much?

PATIENT H417
It's um, it's about 140.

DOCTOR H417
140 okay.

PATIENT H417
Yeah.

DOCTOR H417
Um that's fine uh any problems with low, low blood sugar?

PATIENT H417
The lowest I ever went was, I tested myself one time and it was like uh 85.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
That's not, that's not that low is it?

DOCTOR H417
85 is not that low.

PATIENT H417
But when I get below 70.

DOCTOR H417
Then you start feeling it?

PATIENT H417
Well I haven't got below 70 yet.

DOCTOR H417
Okay, alright well that's good.  So then you're not going too low.  Um when was your last eye appointment?

PATIENT H417
I have one coming up.

DOCTOR H417
You do okay.

PATIENT H417
Yeah it's September 23rd.

DOCTOR H417
How about your foot, any foot appointments?

PATIENT H417
I have to make one but I been taking care of my feet.

DOCTOR H417
You haven't?

PATIENT H417
I have.

DOCTOR H417
Okay good, that's good.  And you do any exercise?

PATIENT H417
Yes.

DOCTOR H417
And your dieting?

PATIENT H417
Yeah I uh eat no white food at all.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
No white you know only whole wheat or whole grain and I exercise too.

DOCTOR H417
Alright.  Now your last cholesterol was in May as well.  Your good cholesterol was 124 or sorry your bad cholesterol was 124; your good cholesterol was 40.  Now DOCTOR I think changed your cholesterol medication at that time too right?

PATIENT H417
Uh yeah he did.  He changed it.  Yes.

DOCTOR H417
Now there are a couple, there are a couple of notes here okay.  First of all the @@@ problems, okay.  Now DOCTOR had increased your glipizide from 10 to 20.  Did that ever happen?  The glipizide to twice a day to 10 mg?

PATIENT H417
Yeah that's before the uh metformin.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  But then you start the metformin and then you just kept on the 10 is that correct?

PATIENT H417
Uh I started doing 20.  I mean I was going 20 and then I got on the metformin okay and then I found out that I went back down to 10 of the glipizide and did the metformin and my sugar got better.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  Alright, alright so what we need to do at this point so and you've been taking your cholesterol medication regularly correct?

PATIENT H417
Right.

DOCTOR H417
Okay um and it looks like your cholesterol medication was actually changed at one point.

PATIENT H417
Well they started what simvastatin, yes simvastatin.

DOCTOR H417
Yeah so when was that changed?

PATIENT H417
Oh that was changed when I first, let's see when was it changed; let me think back, it was changed about three or four months ago.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  Well if it was changed three or four months ago.

PATIENT H417
It should be in my chart somewhere.

DOCTOR H417
Well we need to repeat it okay.  Now this says on 06/10 so it says, this note said you're on simvastatin 20 mg okay.  It says they wanted to increase but they were going to re-discuss it on your visit to the uh pharmacist.

PATIENT H417
Yeah we were supposed to do some more tests on it.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
I believe before we increased it to see how my, see how my cholesterol is.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
Since I been on the uh the simvastatin.

DOCTOR H417
You haven't been taking that regularly, were you having trouble not taking that regularly?

PATIENT H417
I took I uh actually take half of it.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  Okay but you're doing that every day?

PATIENT H417
Yeah I have it every day.

DOCTOR H417
And but before your cholesterol was last checked in May.  Were you taking it kind of sporadically then like every once in a while or were you taking it consistently?

PATIENT H417
I take my medicine consistently.

DOCTOR H417
Okay it's all good.  Well I mean maybe something we do need to increase is.

PATIENT H417
What?

DOCTOR H417
The simvastatin.

PATIENT H417
Why?

DOCTOR H417
Well because your cholesterol wasn't at goal, so a lot of people with diabetes.  Diabetes have certain goals okay and they're with regard to sugar control okay because we know that blood sugar can affect vessel disease, especially small vessel disease and then we also aim to control a lot of other stuff like blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking okay.

PATIENT H417
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H417
Cause you know that can affect heart disease and it turns out diabetics die most from heart disease, vascular disease so anything we can do to limit that is good.  Now all these studies of people that live over the years tend to show that we're
being good doctors if we meet these goals and we decrease the risks of these events happening if we meet these goals.  So that's kind of why we have you on it is because we know that if we get your cholesterol to a certain goal, being a diabetic, that will help you live longer.

PATIENT H417
Okay.

DOCTOR H417
So that's why we, that's why we kind of encourage that, we kind of push you to do that stuff.  Um and that's why DOCTOR wanted to increase your simvastatin alright from 20 to 40 cause he wanted to see your bad cholesterol, the LDL, should be around 100.

PATIENT H417
But should we uh do a test to make sure?

DOCTOR H417
Well it depends, the last time it was checked was in May right?

PATIENT H417
I believe so, I can't remember.

DOCTOR H417
Yeah.

PATIENT H417
To be honest with you.  Can you see it there?

DOCTOR H417
Yeah.  So the last time we checked your cholesterol was in May.

PATIENT H417
Right well that's when I did the blood tests right.

DOCTOR H417
Yeah.

PATIENT H417
Okay yeah.

DOCTOR H417
And it was okay but it wasn't quite, it was 124, it should be around 100.

PATIENT H417
Okay.

DOCTOR H417
Okay and that's kind of the same for your A1c wasn't at goal either and that's why we added your metformin so okay.  So.

PATIENT H417
So that A1c is a actual test, a test over a period of time right?

DOCTOR H417
Yes.

PATIENT H417
Okay.

DOCTOR H417
Yes.  Um yeah and it checks to make sure how well your sugar's controlled.  It should be checked every three months.

PATIENT H417
Okay so it’s time.

DOCTOR H417
Yeah.  So how about this?

PATIENT H417
Okay.

DOCTOR H417
Cause why don't we check your cholesterol.

PATIENT H417
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H417
Okay, alright.  If your cholesterol is still elevated let's go increase your medication.

PATIENT H417
Well okay.

DOCTOR H417
Alright.

PATIENT H417
Because I think it's what it is, 25 mg.

DOCTOR H417
You're at 20 mg.

PATIENT H417
And I'm doing 10.

DOCTOR H417
You are doing, at least by this; you're doing 20 mg so you get a 40 mg tablet.

PATIENT H417
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR H417
And you're cutting them in half.

PATIENT H417
Okay.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  So by this you're taking 20 mg so we would increase to the 40 mg alright.

PATIENT H417
That's a whole pill.

DOCTOR H417
Yeah.

PATIENT H417
But you're gonna do the test right correct?

DOCTOR H417
Yeah.  If that's what it takes to get you to increase yeah I'll do that.

PATIENT H417
Yeah because I want to make sure.

DOCTOR H417
Alright.  Have you been eating today, you been fasting?

PATIENT H417
Uh, I had one of those bars, one of those Nature Valley Bars.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
@@@.

DOCTOR H417
That’s okay.  Deep breaths, again, deep breath.  Your pulse is a little bit fast today.  Is it always a little quick?

PATIENT H417
Well I'd had been in the gym for about an hour.

DOCTOR H417
Oh you were in the gym?

PATIENT H417
Yeah.

DOCTOR H417
You were working out okay.

PATIENT H417
Yeah.

DOCTOR H417
I was gonna say.

PATIENT H417
@@@ yeah.

DOCTOR H417
Maybe that’s why.

PATIENT H417
My blood pressure was kind of high I said I had just got done at the gym.

DOCTOR H417
Okay, alright.

PATIENT H417
I'd been at the gym about maybe.

DOCTOR H417
Before you came up here?  Yeah.  And you're gonna set up an eye appointment and a foot appointment?

PATIENT H417
Oh yes.

DOCTOR H417
Okay so I think that's what we're gonna do alright.  We'll repeat your cholesterol but you need to be fasting so you have to come back and do it okay.

PATIENT H417
Okay.  Have to come back?

DOCTOR H417
Yeah you can do it, I don't know do you come to the gym here or?

PATIENT H417
No I go to Bally’s.

DOCTOR H417
Okay close by?

PATIENT H417
Huh?

DOCTOR H417
Is it close by?

PATIENT H417
Close by my home.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  How often to get up here?

PATIENT H417
Not often at all.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  We'll repeat your cholesterol.  The next time you can come back and I'll put it in for like in the next week.

PATIENT H417
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H417
For you to come back in okay.

PATIENT H417
Okay.

DOCTOR H417
Any time between now and next week should be good.  Uh I'll put it in for tomorrow morning and you can just get it in the morning.

PATIENT H417
Well what's you gonna do about this wheeze?

DOCTOR H417
Well right now your lungs sound pretty clear okay.

PATIENT H417
Cause I think it's in here cause I have to uh sometimes I have to use that albuterol.

DOCTOR H417
You use the albuterol inhaler?  You really have to avoid certain foods that gives you um.

PATIENT H417
Well like uh, like if I eat something like pasta with tomato sauce.

DOCTOR H417
Yeah.

PATIENT H417
Late at night.

DOCTOR H417
Yes.

PATIENT H417
Then I get it, I can't help it.

DOCTOR H417
Right.

PATIENT H417
Or really spicy.

DOCTOR H417
Do you have coffee?

PATIENT H417
Yeah sometimes in the morning.

DOCTOR H417
Okay does that set you off?

PATIENT H417
Yeah.

DOCTOR H417
Um sometimes people that have, it’s usually due to reflux or an inflammation in the esophagus from like the stomach acid.

PATIENT H417
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H417
What we can do is you take the albuterol; you get wheezing mostly at night right?

PATIENT H417
Yeah when I lay down.

DOCTOR H417
Yeah.

PATIENT H417
Uh I have shortness of breath.  Now when I get on the treadmill @@@ fine @@@ uh you know I have like shortness of breath.

DOCTOR H417
You do have shortness of breath?

PATIENT H417
Yeah.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  Any swelling now?

PATIENT H417
Any swelling?

DOCTOR H417
Yeah in your legs or anything like that?

PATIENT H417
No. Uh uh.

DOCTOR H417
Um how about when you walk regularly?  No?

PATIENT H417
No.

DOCTOR H417
Chest pain?

PATIENT H417
No.

DOCTOR H417
Alright um.

PATIENT H417
You think  you can give me something for this wheezing though?

DOCTOR H417
What's that?

PATIENT H417
Can you give me something for this wheezing?

DOCTOR H417
Depending on what's causing the wheezing.  You know if you're telling me when you're on the treadmill and you’re short of breath do you mean you're not able to exercise as much as you can or?  How many flights of stairs can you go up before you get short of breath?  Or is that a problem for you or not a problem at all?

PATIENT H417
It depends.

DOCTOR H417
Do you wheeze when you get on the treadmill?  No.  Do you get short of breath still?

PATIENT H417
The only time I wheeze is when I'm laying down.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  And what's this with the treadmill thing?

PATIENT H417
Well when I get off the treadmill sometimes I got to like kind of catch my breath but I don't be wheezing.  Like my wife says sometimes when I be talking to her she'd say I hear you wheezing.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  It may be that sometimes if it's worse at night, you know this wheezing it could be just the reflux that's maybe causing this uh your.

PATIENT H417
The wheezing?

DOCTOR H417
Yeah I mean it could be.  So maybe suppress some of the stomach acid a little bit, that might help it too and we could try it.

PATIENT H417
Put this on hold again.

DOCTOR H417
Well I can give you something for it.  I can give you something for it, what do you think?

PATIENT H417
You say you didn't see any problems with my lungs or anything?

DOCTOR H417
Your PFT showed you maybe have a mild obstructive defect okay.  Now the albuterol should help that.  Does your albuterol help the wheezing that you have at night?  Have you tried it at night the albuterol?

PATIENT H417
Yeah sometimes I can try it.

DOCTOR H417
Sometimes, does it help?

PATIENT H417
Uh yeah it helps.  But you know I spoke to DOCTOR and he said that the albuterol is not doing any good and that's what he told me.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
Um you’re trying to tell me there's no problems with the lungs.  

DOCTOR H417
Yeah well right now it doesn't look like there is okay.  What I'm saying is that sometimes if your stomach acid at night, you lay back and that irritates your lungs cause it can.  It can cause a little constriction and can cause that wheezing.  Your lungs sound clear on exam right now, so there's no problem.

PATIENT H417
Okay.

DOCTOR H417
So what if we try and just suppress the stomach acid alright.  You just take the pills, take twice a day, we'll check it, we'll try it for a month, four to eight weeks, see if that helps at all alright.

PATIENT H417
Okay.

DOCTOR H417
Especially at night and then if it does we have our answer.

PATIENT H417
Okay.

DOCTOR H417
Alright.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT H417
Can you uh, give me something to enhance my sexual performance?

DOCTOR H417
(Laughter) You just add it on right at the end don't you?

PATIENT H417
(Laughter).

DOCTOR H417
@@@ I'm just kidding.  Um yeah we can talk about that too I mean.  I think getting your blood sugars under control that @@@ is fine.  Can we talk about that when you come in in a month?

PATIENT H417
I was hoping that you'd give me some today.

DOCTOR H417
Alright well I'll see what I can do.

PATIENT H417
(Laughter).

DOCTOR H417
Next time, don’t wait until the end of the appointment.

PATIENT H417
Well I want to get the important stuff out first.

DOCTOR H417
Alright, alright, alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:00  DOCTOR IN:  41:10)

DOCTOR H417
Alright.  So you're able to actually get an erection?

PATIENT H417
Uh yes, a little.

DOCTOR H417
What's the problem?  Is it I mean.

PATIENT H417
I want it better.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  So what do you mean better?  You mean you want harder?

PATIENT H417
Yes.

DOCTOR H417
You want it to last longer?

PATIENT H417
Yeah I want it to last longer and I want it better.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  Now are you able to ejaculate?

PATIENT H417
Yes.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.  Is it, do you ejaculate too quick?

PATIENT H417
Sometimes.

DOCTOR H417
That's a different story okay.  But you are able to achieve an erection?

PATIENT H417
Yeah but it's not hard enough.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
My wife want it harder.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
Or she’s gonna leave me.

DOCTOR H417
How's the, how's stuff with your wife, is it alright?

PATIENT H417
What?

DOCTOR H417
Here's what I'm saying okay is it, yes Viagra could help you.

PATIENT H417
But that's kind of dangerous isn't it?  What about Cialis?

DOCTOR H417
Oh Cialis, Viagra kind of work in the same way okay.  Now both are dangerous if you're on medications that can lower your blood that like a nitrite is what it’s called that lowers your blood pressure if you have heart disease right.

PATIENT H417
Yeah.

DOCTOR H417
And I don't think that you have, you don't have any indication of heart disease right now.  You're not getting chest pains when you run; you're not on any medications like the nitrates okay.  Those are contraindications.  There are a couple of things that are worrisome right that they can cause you know this you know your erections not being so great okay.  So one is vascular disease, so someone who has uncontrolled diabetes.  We always worry about the vessels down there being a affected, alright.  So that's one thing that's the reason you need to control your diabetes right.  The other thing we worry about is just psychological stuff.  Like sex is psychological as everything else is.

PATIENT H417
Yeah it is.

DOCTOR H417
Yeah and if you're not as attracted or you've been married a long time, things maybe aren't going as well.

PATIENT H417
(Laughter) That could be a reason huh?

DOCTOR H417
Well it could be, I mean you tell me.  I mean do you think is this kind of a tough time right now in the relationship or?

PATIENT H417
Uh uh.

DOCTOR H417
Okay.

PATIENT H417
No.

DOCTOR H417
You think there's a psychological component to it?

PATIENT H417
It's part of the psychological I mean that's part of the physical as well.

DOCTOR H417
Okay, alright.

PATIENT H417
So what you're saying that I shouldn't take this stuff?
