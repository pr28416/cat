PATIENT N200
Okay.

DOCTOR N200
And yeah she can come in and sort of give her input too and seat here, up to you @@@.  Yeah it looks like the last time you were here was November.  At that time did you get a flu shot in November?  Okay.  And how have you been since then?  

PATIENT N200
Uh the only problem I had was I was taking the anti-@@@, cholesterol @@@ and I ran out of it and they wouldn't refill it because I had some problems with VA finance.

DOCTOR N200
Yeah.

PATIENT N200
Coordinated.

DOCTOR N200
Did they refill it eventually?

PATIENT N200
No.

DOCTOR N200
You still don’t have it?  Okay.

PATIENT N200
Uh I don't need this, as far as I know, because when I was here the last time she said all of the.

DOCTOR N200
The labs looked good.

PATIENT N200
Everything seems to be within normal range so uh.

DOCTOR N200
Yeah.

PATIENT N200
I have no side effects and no problems from not taking it and uh it was a hyper cholesterol situation. 

DOCTOR N200
Yeah when you got the labs this morning um did you eat beforehand at all or no?

PATIENT N200
No.

DOCTOR N200
Okay.  Sorry one second.  So it's a little elevated, your LDL is 161 and we want to see it under 120 um so and it's been a couple weeks or months would you say since you've been off of that cholesterol medication?

PATIENT N200
Oh I'd say two months.

DOCTOR N200
Two months okay.

PATIENT N200
But at 161, as opposed to be 120 I don’t think it’s substantive @@@.

DOCTOR N200
Right, right, yeah.

PATIENT N200
@@@.

DOCTOR N200
You know we'll talk to her, just looking at your you know history of high blood pressure, things like that, you know you're at a little more risk for things to happen so um.

PATIENT N200
Well I'm using kind of a diet and exercise program uh.

DOCTOR N200
Hmm.

PATIENT N200
Maybe more of a vegetarian diet.

DOCTOR N200
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N200
And uh.

DOCTOR N200
When you were on the statin, did you have any muscle pains, aches, anything like that?  Not really okay.  The other labs look good.  

PATIENT N200
I may have had muscles pains or aches but I don't think they were induced by the statin.

DOCTOR N200
Okay, it's a real short things @@@.

PATIENT N200
I exercise, I lift weights.

DOCTOR N200

DOCTOR N200

DOCTOR N200
Yeah cause they know how to.

PATIENT N200
And uh, no I had it, he took it but it was still elevated and he said I can't do anything.

DOCTOR N200

The instructor from the Dental Clinic said no you can't do anything as long as there's such an elevated blood pressure.

DOCTOR N200

DOCTOR N200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT N200
@@@.

DOCTOR N200
Or how much it costs. 

PATIENT N200
So uh that was how I wound up with.

DOCTOR N200
The diagnosis yeah.  But I mean honestly you look pretty good,  @@@.

PATIENT N200
Well, that’s nice of you to say.

DOCTOR N200
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT N200

PATIENT N200
Okay and I don't need anything then I'm all set.

DOCTOR N200
Yeah I'm just gonna take a listen to you and then I might have DOCTOR you know pop her head in to say hi.  Deep breaths and out, again, again, again.  Um this right here, have you had this a while?

PATIENT N200
Yeah this is from @@@.

DOCTOR N200
Yeah how long ago was that?

PATIENT N200
Week.

DOCTOR N200
Weeks okay.  Anything new of concern?

PATIENT N200
No the only reason, I know how it happens, so all I got to do is take one aspirin.

DOCTOR N200
And you get those yeah.

PATIENT N200
I hit the back of my hand and I have this huge hematoma.

DOCTOR N200
And then with the psoriasis, where does it usually affect you?

PATIENT N200
Psoriasis is pretty much gone.  Uh I switched over to a pretty you know, I don't know what, oh I know what I need is the sunscreen.

DOCTOR N200
Sunscreen.

PATIENT N200
Yeah, it's uh the Derm Clinic gave it to me but the sunscreen should be in there.

DOCTOR N200
Yeah I'll check, it might have just fallen off.

PATIENT N200
And uh I could use some of that since @@@.

DOCTOR N200
Let me check your @@@ here.  Any pain when I do that?

PATIENT N200
No.

DOCTOR N200
Good.  I'll go talk to DOCTOR @@@.

PATIENT N200
Yeah, fine, @@@.

DOCTOR N200
I'll be just one second.  

(DOCTOR OUT:  80:44  DOCTOR IN:  88:21)

DOCTOR N200
So, I talked to her about everything that’s going on. Um we both think that you know because that level of fasting and because it looked like your cholesterol was under better control with that medication, I would highly recommend restarting it.

PATIENT N200
Fine, restart it, @@@.

DOCTOR N200
Um but now if you start noticing muscle aches or anything like that then tell us.

PATIENT N200
I've been taking that @@@.

DOCTOR N200
Okay so you know we'll restart that um and then um do you want to pick it up here or I can have them mail it to you?

PATIENT N200
Yeah they can mail it to me.

DOCTOR N200
Yeah I'll do it.

PATIENT N200
But the um, if you can get the uh.

DOCTOR N200
The sunscreen?

PATIENT N200
Yeah.

DOCTOR N200
Yeah okay, so I'll do that right now.  Okay.

PATIENT N200
If you could just add that, it should be on the Derm.  I as at the Derm Clinic.

DOCTOR N200
I think it fell off yeah so I can just renew it.  I can have that mailed to you or you can pick it up.

PATIENT N200
Yeah just mail it to me.

DOCTOR N200
Okay, okay.

PATIENT N200
You can do that.

DOCTOR N200
Okay um so basically we think that you know since you're doing really well you know you can come back to see me and DOCTOR in five to six months um but for just like with the cholesterol we're gonna send a letter out to get labs in the next two months basically, six to eight weeks.

PATIENT N200
