PATIENT C737 
Yes ma'am.  How are you today?

DOCTOR C737

PATIENT C737
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR C737
@@@.

PATIENT C737
@@@.

DOCTOR C737
Really.  @@@.

PATIENT C737
You know what @@@ a couple weeks ago I came in, I came into the hospital and I have like a stomach pain or something.

DOCTOR C737
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C737
And um this is from someone in Primary Care and DOCTOR, she suggested I get a course of action which I follow and it seems to resolve itself.  She said not to eat anything for 24 hours or a subsequent 24 hour period to be on a liquid diet.

DOCTOR C737
Okay.

PATIENT C737
She said to allow my colon and things to kind of relax.

DOCTOR C737
Okay.

PATIENT C737
At any rate that seems to have occurred and then this morning I woke up and I had an explosive case of diarrhea.

DOCTOR C737
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C737
And then you know what, sitting there waiting for you it occurred to me what happened to me and I know what I did.

DOCTOR C737
What'd you do?

PATIENT C737
I bought a brand new stove.

DOCTOR C737
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C737
And I had the stove put in on Thursday.

DOCTOR C737
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C737
And yesterday was the first time that I actually fried something in it.

DOCTOR C737
Okay.

PATIENT C737
And I fried some chicken.

DOCTOR C737
Okay.

PATIENT C737
And chicken fried too quickly and what I did was, I bit into that chicken and when I bit into a few parts, I realized after I saw I looked at the bone and everything, I realized that chicken wasn't done.

DOCTOR C737
@@@.

PATIENT C737
It wasn't cooked right.  So what I did with the subsequent pieces that I made and I smothered them.

DOCTOR C737
Okay.

PATIENT C737
To make sure they were done but I think what gave me the stomach trauma was that piece of chicken that I ate.

DOCTOR C737
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C737
It wasn't done.

DOCTOR C737
Okay.

PATIENT C737
That can do it can't it?

DOCTOR C737
Oh sure.

PATIENT C737
Uh-huh and I think that's what it is.

DOCTOR C737
Okay.  So @@@ made this appointment is for this abdominal pain?

PATIENT C737
That's right uh-huh.

DOCTOR C737
And nothing else okay.  How long would that have been?

PATIENT C737
Oh it started at 7:15 this morning.

DOCTOR C737
Okay.  When did you eat the chicken though?

PATIENT C737
Last night.

DOCTOR C737
Okay.

PATIENT C737
And I put some, took sedatives and went to sleep and slept through the night.

DOCTOR C737
Okay.

PATIENT C737
Okay and then when I woke up, I think that the @@@ made me wake up.

DOCTOR C737
Hmm.

PATIENT C737
Okay.  I’m not trying to be the doctor.

DOCTOR C737

PATIENT C737

DOCTOR C737
And has it been constant in nature, is it constant?

PATIENT C737

DOCTOR C737

PATIENT C737
On the scale, moderate discomfort.

DOCTOR C737
Uh-huh.  So when was the diarrhea?

PATIENT C737
Diarrhea’s all gone as we speak.

DOCTOR C737
How many times have you gone today?

PATIENT C737
Six times today.  Now it's just kind of.

DOCTOR C737
Did you @@@ anything?

PATIENT C737
Yes it is.  So there's nothing left in my stomach but when I went to the washroom it’s as if my bowels in terms of seizing.

DOCTOR C737
