DOCTOR H942
And uh what are they gonna give you for your anxiety?

PATIENT H942
Oh they didn't give me nothing you know.  It helps a little with the high blood pressure medicine though, I mean it seems to help with it but it's like you know we got a MRI done.

DOCTOR H942
Uh-huh.  Let me pull it up and see what it shows us here.  @@@.  Okay so you had a CAT scan done because you had maybe fallen. No bleeds, that looks good.  Then they thought maybe you had um a vessel that looked a little abnormal so that's why they got the MRA and that was normal.

PATIENT H942
You know cause that didn't include, that didn't include my neck, though?

DOCTOR H942
MRA.

PATIENT H942
When I, when I took the slip and fall, the top portion, I mean my head hit the cement.

Uh I take 300 mg a day.

DOCTOR H942
Okay.

PATIENT H942

DOCTOR H942
Okay.  Cause it looks like when they checked your phenytoin level as you can see in July it was lower than the therapeutic.

PATIENT H942
Oh you know what I haven't even taken it for, for a long time.  You know what I mean, I mean I can take it for a while and then I didn't take it for a while.

DOCTOR H942

DOCTOR H942
Like having the seizures and.

PATIENT H942

PATIENT H942
Uh yeah you know what after I'd been off it, yeah because I was having so many aches and pains I mean I just things are popping and just hurting you know for now reason, I didn't understand it you know but that seemed to help but.

DOCTOR H942
And you were taking @@@

PATIENT H942
Yeah I've been off that for quite a while too.

DOCTOR H942
That uh, at the VA, because of our formulary, they might have been @@@ to see it.  Let's @@@ we will obviously put in a referral for you to go see them and then let's see here.  Well we can put you back on the lisinopril instead of this combination pill for sure.

PATIENT H942
Is that the @@@

DOCTOR H942
No the blood pressure, the guy you saw the other day put you on a different blood pressure medicine but we can switch you back on your same home blood pressure medicine and then yeah the Actos caused, the Actos 2 um, it looks like we put in a special request for but that's totally fine so we'll put that in uh Pharmacy non-formulary request.  Actos 15 mg daily by mouth 30 pills with refills by mail.  Diabetes previous regime @@@.  Okay, good.  So we're gonna try to get the ball rolling here on the Actos and do you have a glucometer at home?

DOCTOR H942
Do you know precision monitor do you think cause I'm only allowed to refer precision @@@.

PATIENT H942

DOCTOR H942
Alright I'll.

PATIENT H942
They get @@@.

DOCTOR H942
Let me see if they have @@@ on our formulary here too and I'll just in a special request for that also.  Okay everything @@@.

PATIENT H942
And I think it was not a generic @@@.

DOCTOR H942
Yeah.  Just get a @@@.  Let's see if they have that or I'll just put in a non-formulary. @@@ Yeah, well let me see if I can put in.  @@@ another medication in the same...

PATIENT H942
Category.

DOCTOR H942
...family, yeah so let's see @@@ family @@@ class by itself, @@@.  So how, is your like, so have you been taking the penicillin since you were last seen?

PATIENT H942
Oh yeah, yeah.  Yeah I'm taking it every day.  Yeah with what they gave me I mean I've been doing it every day, taking everything.  I mean I've been feeling better but I'm still in pain, you know when I took that fall.

DOCTOR H942
Okay.

PATIENT H942
And my head feels, but it feels like @@@ fluid cause every time I try to move it I get, it takes time to get to the same place you know.

DOCTOR H942
Now have you ever been on any um like the more, so basically you're on a fancy version of sulfa urea which are medicines that help bring down blood sugar.  Have you ever been on like glyburide or glipizide before?  So I think I might just have you try one of those instead cause it's cheaper though okay.

PATIENT H942
Okay yeah.

DOCTOR H942
So the main side effect of any medicine is it's gonna lower your blood sugars.  It could make the blood sugars go too low so if you find yourself getting woozy.

PATIENT H942
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

DOCTOR H942
Dizzy, stop taking it and we'll just have you come in.  And it looks like you have hepatitis C.

PATIENT H942
Yeah.

DOCTOR H942
How long has that been the case for?

PATIENT H942
Ever since I was in the military.

DOCTOR H942
Have you ever had any complications as far as you can tell?  

PATIENT H942
@@@ no.

DOCTOR H942
Have you ever seen a liver specialist?

PATIENT H942
No, no.  But that was one of the reasons I didn't want to take that Tylenol.

DOCTOR H942
Oh that makes sense yeah.

PATIENT H942
Yeah I mean @@@ yeah.  I read up on that stuff and everything and you know I, even I a have friend that had cancer, he died you know so he gave me like six tablets of morphine because I was having so much pain.

DOCTOR H942
Oh.

PATIENT H942
So that's how I hurt my back and then I hurt my back again you know so I fall @@@ and I got a disk that doesn't want to @@@. I tried that.  You know I tried everything you know.

DOCTOR H942
Yeah.

PATIENT H942
So I went through the drinking route and that made me sicker.  I said you know screw everything.

DOCTOR H942
Yeah.

PATIENT H942
But what she's putting in I've been doing pretty good.

DOCTOR H942
Okay and so I'll put in for that and then the request for Actos.  I will put in the request for the Cymbalta but the worse that'll happen is that they'll say no.

PATIENT H942
Yeah.

DOCTOR H942
You're going to get in to see the @@@ so I'll put everything in just so they know, that's fine uh so Cymbalta 60 mg and now.

PATIENT H942
Oh um.

DOCTOR H942
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H942
I've been having, for the past year, I think two years I've been having like a tickle in my throat and I've been coughing a lot within the past year and it's getting worse and worse.  I worked with asbestos for about 18 years.

DOCTOR H942
Hmm.

PATIENT H942
And I’m like coughing day and night. I don't smoke cigarettes you know and I don't know where this cough is coming from.

DOCTOR H942
How long has it been there for?

PATIENT H942
It's been getting real bad within the past couple months I mean like uh, hard time breathing, I have a gravely voice.

DOCTOR H942
Oh.

PATIENT H942
Coughing you know what I mean.

DOCTOR H942
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT H942
@@@ in my throat.

DOCTOR H942
Okay we'll do some checking on that today so dry cough and how many months would you say this has been going on for?

PATIENT H942
Uh a good four months I would say.  It's been getting worse and worse to the point now I'm coughing day and night you know what I mean.

DOCTOR H942
Is there anything specific that's triggering this cough?

PATIENT H942
No.

DOCTOR H942
…bringing it about?

PATIENT H942
No, I mean it just seems like it's this dry cough, sometimes it's in the middle of the night, during the day.

DOCTOR H942
@@@ from sleep?

PATIENT H942
Oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR H942
Okay.

PATIENT H942
That's causing me to get up four or five times a night just to cough you know what I mean.  I @@@ cough drops by the bed.

DOCTOR H942
Any problems with um acid reflux or heartburn?

PATIENT H942
Not, you know what that was the first thing I took, Zantac.

DOCTOR H942
Oh Zantac yeah.

PATIENT H942
I took that, that seemed to help a little bit but no it still stayed there.

DOCTOR H942
Uh no history of reflux.

PATIENT H942
Oh no I had that.

DOCTOR H942
Okay.

PATIENT H942
It didn't really have that for 20-30 years.

DOCTOR H942
Okay tried taking Zantac but cough is not improve.  And any issues with seasonal allergies?

PATIENT H942
No, none of that.

DOCTOR H942
Okay.  Or feeling like a kind of a postnasal drip down the back of your throat?

PATIENT H942
No.

DOCTOR H942
Okay.

PATIENT H942
That's the only reason I'm @@@.

DOCTOR H942
Okay well one thing you are on lisinopril and all medications in that class can predispose people to cough so we could try switching the lisinopril to another medication that works similarly that is less likely to cause a cough.

PATIENT H942
But you see the thing is I was taking the lisinopril before and then the cough.

DOCTOR H942
Yeah but people can get it even then.  Oh no we're still gonna get a chest x-ray just to check out @@@ certainly uh.

PATIENT H942
@@@ okay.

DOCTOR H942
So we can and that's for cough.

PATIENT H942
@@@.

DOCTOR H942
Okay.  The gravely voice also uh is a little bit.

PATIENT H942
@@@  It builds up, it's kind of up here then it's down here.

DOCTOR H942
Yeah.  We'll get a chest x-ray to see what's going on uh.  @@@ Chest, two views @@@ We'll get that done today so we'll see if anything is super obvious that we can do anything about right away and then okay.  So we talked about your cough and them um diabetes how's that going?

PATIENT H942
That seems like it's going okay.  You know I mean, I'm not really high, I've been in maybe @@@ 180s, 210s, something like that you know @@@.

DOCTOR H942
What about first thing in the morning when you test it?

PATIENT H942
Yeah, yeah in the morning you know it'll be 160, 180 you know.  Then you know after I eat and take the pills, you know it'll go up to 200 or something, then it'll come down some more.  Like I kept a log.

DOCTOR H942
Yeah.

PATIENT H942
You know @@@ it seems like between 180 and like 220 yeah.

DOCTOR H942
Okay cause it looks like looking at your labs we got an A1c which was are all of your blood sugars you know the previous three months and your number in July was good.  So whatever you've been doing.

PATIENT H942
Okay.

DOCTOR H942
Between July and April it was right, @@@.

PATIENT H942
Okay.

DOCTOR H942
Uh and then your cholesterol looks good.  You’re on the meds for cholesterol so we'll keep that going and then let's see for the Hep C we've gotta get you some labs uh, just basically, for people with Hep C every year we like to check the marker for liver cancer, it's just a blood test and we'll get an ultrasound of your liver to make sure that everything looks okay.

PATIENT H942
Okay.

DOCTOR H942
So these obviously don’t need to be done today um and your liver function tests were pretty good so.  Yeah we usually check that once a year just to make sure everything looks good so we'll get that stuff cooking.  So @@@ get this done today and then we can forward the  ultrasound that they will contact you about. No emergency on that either.  @@@ lab we can get that sent to @@@.  Okay but in terms of let's see what's on the reminder's list and then we'll go over any other specific concerns. So uh Pneumovax, are you interested in getting a pneumonia shot?

PATIENT H942
The knees are bad yeah.  I'm not sure if it's my knees or my back.  Oh you know what.  

DOCTOR H942
Have you ever had a colonoscopy before?

PATIENT H942

PATIENT H942
Uh.

DOCTOR H942

Okay, uh what about my lower back and my arm, yeah that was taken yeah they said it was a pre-existing condition but you know I mean it was pre-existing you know I was able to work but now you know after the accident I'm not able to work.

DOCTOR H942

Let's see the last time we did your prostate blood test done @@@ oh perfect, that was done in July and that was normal.  @@@ thing we're going to schedule you for today really is this issue of, get you scheduled for, so it sounds like the main thing that's bothering you now are these headaches.

PATIENT H942
Yeah I mean that and the cough I mean.

DOCTOR H942
Yeah.

PATIENT H942
You know and I just can't get around like I used to you know what I mean.  It's a combination of things.  I let everything, you know everything starts @@@ so one thing happens you know I could say that my whole body's like somebody shot me.

DOCTOR H942
Well it sounds like, too, when you get really anxious it kind of precludes you from being able to like do what you're supposed to be do.

PATIENT H942
Yeah.

DOCTOR H942
And take care of yourself like you’re supposed to, hopefully you know by getting you on a better anxiety regimen and getting you someone to talk to regularly, you know that can help kind of contain that so you can do everything else you need to do.

PATIENT H942
Yeah, even myself, you know my sister's getting, she sends my nieces down there to see me just a little bit.  Cause I won't come out for days, you know weeks sometimes then she'll send her kids down to see if I'm still alive and stuff.

PATIENT H942
No, no.  Early in the morning, I don’t even watch TV and I got one already. @@@

DOCTOR H942
Have you tried taking anything for them that helps?

PATIENT H942
No.  The reason I didn't take it sooner cause I didn't want to take anything else.

PATIENT H942
Well like yeah I just found those @@@.

DOCTOR H942
Yeah.

PATIENT H942
But yeah maybe, maybe it doesn't @@@ so.

DOCTOR H942
So why don't we try cause maybe it's just stress.  You know maybe it's like some sort of a @@@ muscle spasm going on in your shoulder here.  It could be something, your kidney function is fine so you should be able to tolerate some anti-inflammatories and we'll see if that does the trick.  So let me put in for that.  Let me do a quick look and a listen I feel like here there's some kind of a, you and I are only, kind of like the tip of the iceberg, all this stuff that we have to go over for you, so even if I talk to my boss about you, we'll have you come back in not too long uh to make sure everything is kind of on the right step.  So let me take a look and a listen.
