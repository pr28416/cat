DOCTOR T505
You haven't seen anything okay.  And it's weird that it'll be just in one spot too.  But that's where you scratch it.  Did that start after you were scratching, there was nothing there that started to itch and then you were scratching?

PATIENT T505
Yeah there wasn't nothing here, it was like this.

DOCTOR T505
Okay and then it started to itch.

PATIENT T505
Yeah.

DOCTOR T505
And then you started scratching and then that came on.

PATIENT T505
Yeah that came but I was bleeding.

DOCTOR T505
So there might have been from scratching then from that?

PATIENT T505
Yeah, it was bleeding you know.  It don't itch right now.  But see @@@ there one time I didn't get any relief and the doctor gave me some allergy pills and then I I went and it was okay.  And then it came back again a real @@@.

DOCTOR T505
When were you were seen for this?

PATIENT T505
Huh?

DOCTOR T505
When were you seen for this?

PATIENT T505
About a couple of months ago.  Two or three months, I can't remember.  Cause then it don't itch now.

DOCTOR T505
Okay here we go.  Did the medication help then?

PATIENT T505
Yes it did.

DOCTOR T505
Cause we're gonna give you probably something to help with your allergies anyway for the nose and it sounds like what they call allergic rhinitis where you just get a runny nose and it drips back and then one of the most common causes of cough, especially at night when you're on your back and it just kind of drips back and irritates the throat.

PATIENT T505
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR T505
So I think that's why you're having a cough.

PATIENT T505
Oh okay.

DOCTOR T505
So I think we'll probably give you some of this now it'll be, I'll give you enough for a month and then a couple refills, we'll see how you're doing.

PATIENT T505
Okay.

DOCTOR T505
With that uh okay.  But doing good otherwise though?

PATIENT T505
Yeah.

DOCTOR T505
Okay.

PATIENT T505

PATIENT T505
No.

DOCTOR T505
Okay good, ‘cuz that’s why I was going to call @@@ cause they saw you for that last time right.

PATIENT T505

DOCTOR T505
Okay good, good.

PATIENT T505
