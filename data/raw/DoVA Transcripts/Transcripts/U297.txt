If you want to consider surgery okay.

DOCTOR U297
Not your back, your shoulder okay.

PATIENT U297
Well we got to talk about that @@@.

DOCTOR U297
That's a lot, that's fine and that's pushing it.  So I'm saying.  If you it's getting so bad that you can't do your regular daily things.

PATIENT U297
Yeah, like shaving, yeah.

DOCTOR U297
Yeah so then I want you to start thinking about it, in terms of, it's an option.  It's a crappy option but it’s the only other remedy, okay.  But that’s not something you have to answer now.

PATIENT U297
Okay.

DOCTOR U297
@@@.  So to let you know what they would do is they would, you know take a look at your shoulder to see how bad it is.  They might have to replace a joint, with something mechanical and then after that you would have to go to physical therapy anyway to have them get your strength back up.  @@@it’s a pretty tough couple of months, but after that your problem is gone.

PATIENT U297
It would hurt, but it’d be gone you know, @@@.

DOCTOR U297
Yeah.

PATIENT U297
Yeah, ‘cuz you know, the ankles aching, feet swelling. 


DOCTOR U297
Okay the only other thing.  I'm going to be honest so you know we're giving you pain medications, but physical therapy when you can do it and then the only other thing is your weight loss you know.

DOCTOR U297
You know, instead of fried foods, no fried foods @@@.  Instead of going and reaching for a snack like a cookie or something, get an apple, just the right thing.  All that stuff makes a difference.

PATIENT U297
Right, right.

DOCTOR U297

DOCTOR U297
So you live with your daughter right now?

DOCTOR U297
So that memory stuff, the most common cause alright is depressions, stuff like that.
