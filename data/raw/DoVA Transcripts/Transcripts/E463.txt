Time of Encounter:  @@@ 

DOCTOR E463
Hi.

PATIENT E463
I haven't seen you in so long I almost didn't recognize you.

DOCTOR E463
Okay in here.  Anything bothering you now?

PATIENT E463
The word's no, nothing.

DOCTOR E463
Oh.

PATIENT E463
I did my blood work.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah I saw that.

PATIENT E463
She had a hard time getting my blood today too.

DOCTOR E463
Really actually it looks pretty good.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
Uh except your hemoglobin A1c went up a touch, it's 6.1, it was in the 5's previously.  Um but that could also be maybe cause um you've been eating more sweets lately or anything like that.

PATIENT E463
What?

DOCTOR E463
Have you been eating more sweets lately?

PATIENT E463
Not really.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.  It went up a touch.

PATIENT E463
Oh.

DOCTOR E463
It's not, the other time.

PATIENT E463
The only thing I eat that's sweet is yogurt.

DOCTOR E463
Okay I'm not really all that concerned.

PATIENT E463
Really that's all; no I don't eat sweets too much.

DOCTOR E463
Well I saw that you called yesterday.  I didn't call you back knowing that you were going to be in clinic today okay.  Um so I know that the urology people called you about what they found right from the biopsy

PATIENT E463
I don't understand it.  I got a copy of this report. 

DOCTOR E463
Yeah so.

PATIENT E463
Did you get that?  You get that?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
Oh you know okay.

DOCTOR E463
So basically they did the biopsy.  They don't think its cancer yet but they did find, so keep in mind prostate cancer is one of those things that is very slow growing.

PATIENT E463
Hmm.

DOCTOR E463
And the likelihood of somebody passing away from prostate cancer, even if they have it, is low.  They will probably pass away of whatever else is affecting them.  So even though you, so it's kind of like someone let's say if you have high blood pressure but then you have diabetes, the chances are you're gonna die of a complication from diabetes than from high blood pressure.

PATIENT E463
What do they call cancer, what's the term for?

DOCTOR E463
Adenocarcinoma.

PATIENT E463
Oh that's what that means oh.

DOCTOR E463
Yes.

PATIENT E463
I seen it in the report twice, that's all.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah it just means adenocarcinoma it's just describing the type of cancer.  That's a glandular cancer that the @@@.

PATIENT E463
So basically I'm kind of stable?

DOCTOR E463
Well.

PATIENT E463
Or a little bit higher.

DOCTOR E463
It's found, I think what they're trying to describe.  It's a little weird cause they usually say yes it is cancer or no it is not cancer but then they wrote suspicious for so I think they found like a collection of cells that might be heading the cancer route.  Like the way they organize themselves is different from normal tissue so if you have normal tissue or something in between the grey zone and then cancer tissue.  I think they found something that was in the grey zone.  Okay so that's why they wanted to repeat a biopsy in a year and to see.

PATIENT E463
She told me, now usually I come every July.

DOCTOR E463
Hmm?

PATIENT E463
They told me when I left that I'm gonna come back in December.

DOCTOR E463
In December, let me see what they said.

PATIENT E463
I didn't, I didn't say nothing but I just figured well.

DOCTOR E463
No that's fine.  Will need repeat biopsy in one year with another PSA.

PATIENT E463
That's what I usually get every year, same month, July always.

DOCTOR E463
So you always get biopsies done?  Of the prostate, you have done because of the high PSA right?  Okay.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
So remind me around December 10 next time you see me so @@@ because if you are doing every six months.  Remind me that Urology hasn't called me back um but they told you six months over the phone?

PATIENT E463
No they told me when I was leaving the clinic.

DOCTOR E463
Right.

PATIENT E463
I don't really know.

DOCTOR E463
They told you six months though.

PATIENT E463
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR E463
That's what they told you.  Okay that's fine so in December, the winter time, go we'll ask them that question.  Hey you told us we could come back in six months, your note says to me what is it and then at that time we’ll address it. 

PATIENT E463
Okay.

DOCTOR E463
So remind me about that.

PATIENT E463
You ordered me to have um liver biopsy.

DOCTOR E463
I didn't order it but somebody did.

PATIENT E463
Somebody did right.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.  Did they do it yet?

PATIENT E463
They cancelled it.

DOCTOR E463
Why?

PATIENT E463
Because when I went in there I couldn't remember when's the last time I took any aspirin so because I wasn't sure exactly they didn't want to take the chance.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
But I called them and asked them to reschedule.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
But they have yet.

DOCTOR E463
Call them again cause I can't do anything more than have you reschedule it.

PATIENT E463
Is that important?

DOCTOR E463
Hmm?

PATIENT E463
Is it really important or what?

DOCTOR E463
No but they're just trying to see.  The reason why we sent you is the hematology, the blood doctors, because your platelets were low.

PATIENT E463
Right I remember now.

DOCTOR E463
Let's see today, they're still low so, they're still low so we're trying to find the cause of that and so they found that your spleen was big.  Lots of times when people's spleens are big then they also have low platelets cause the spleen sequesters all the, eats up all the platelets okay.  But then we'll wonder why the spleen's big and why is that, why is it doing that so then they found that the liver was big also.  And usually then the liver's big then the spleen gets bigger too.

PATIENT E463
The spleen's over here right?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.  Spleen's on that side, liver's on this side.

PATIENT E463
Right.

DOCTOR E463
And they're all connected.

PATIENT E463
But this used to hurt bad sometimes.

DOCTOR E463
When?

PATIENT E463
Over the last few years.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
And you know what they told me.

DOCTOR E463
What.

PATIENT E463
Oh that's just scar tissue.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.  I mean that could be scar tissue.  But your spleen is actually like way up here, it's like way up here.

PATIENT E463
Yeah right.

DOCTOR E463
It's not down here, its way up here near your ribcage and so then they're well you've got, you have fatty liver.  Why do you have fatty liver and you have a history of drinking so it could be related to that.

PATIENT E463
I really don't.  The drinking's so far back I mean.

DOCTOR E463
I know, I know but that can still do it.  It doesn't matter when you drink it can still do it.  So then that's why they're just trying to find the cause of it.  It's nothing that needs to happen urgently but that should happen at some point within the next year.  I think before 2012 was over I'd try to get the biopsy done okay.

PATIENT E463
I had to call you for the appointment right?

DOCTOR E463
No you call the GI Lab, the GI doctor.

PATIENT E463
Not originally.

DOCTOR E463
Huh?

PATIENT E463
They sent me a letter that I had to call and set up the appointment with you and I called back and said well yeah you're supposed.

DOCTOR E463
To have an appointment with me?

PATIENT E463
Yeah your.

DOCTOR E463
Or you need me to make that appointment.

PATIENT E463
No me?  They said make it.

DOCTOR E463
That's fine that you're seeing me.  You're here.

PATIENT E463
That's what I did.

DOCTOR E463
You're just here for your follow-up.

PATIENT E463
Oh.

DOCTOR E463
But that's something separate.  The liver thing is completely different.

PATIENT E463
No I know that, I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about this.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT E463
How I ended up here today.

DOCTOR E463
No that's fine.  That's how they're doing it these days.

PATIENT E463
Yeah right that's what's she told me.

DOCTOR E463
They just sent you a letter and then you call in to make the appointment.  So I suggest you, whoever you called to schedule it in the first place, the liver biopsy, call them and be like okay I'm not taking my aspirin or tell me when I should be scheduled.

PATIENT E463
Well I thought, that's why I thought you scheduled.  I didn't schedule that.

DOCTOR E463
I didn't schedule the liver biopsy but.

PATIENT E463
After you met me that time.

DOCTOR E463
The liver doctors.

PATIENT E463
I had all that stuff come up, those appointments.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
You know and uh.

DOCTOR E463
The liver doctor scheduled it for you.

PATIENT E463
Hmm.

DOCTOR E463
So what you can do, you can go up to the GI people, the GI Lab right now, to the 13th floor after your done and go like I was supposed to be scheduled for a liver biopsy, it was cancelled because I was still on aspirin but my doctor would like me to reschedule it.

PATIENT E463
Okay.

DOCTOR E463
If not, if they say no you need to see the doctor then tell them to make an appointment with the liver doctor that you saw okay in clinic and then they'll.

PATIENT E463
But I never saw a doctor.

DOCTOR E463
Sure you did.

PATIENT E463
I did?

DOCTOR E463
Yes you did.

PATIENT E463
I saw one of your.

DOCTOR E463
There's a note right here.

PATIENT E463
I saw an Indian doctor.  I don't know, no he wasn't a doctor.  He was more of a nurse type guy.

DOCTOR E463
No you saw a doctor.

PATIENT E463
He was a doctor?

DOCTOR E463
He was an Asian guy yeah.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
He was a middle Asian guy, he's a doc, he's a GI fellow.

PATIENT E463
Oh really.

DOCTOR E463
So he saw you and so he.

PATIENT E463
He didn’t have a white coat on.

DOCTOR E463
That doesn't mean anything.  So yeah he saw you and he's the one who scheduled it.

PATIENT E463
Okay.

DOCTOR E463
So you have to go back up to the 13th floor and be like hey I need to see the person's name.  It's a common last name but I never know how to pronounce it.

PATIENT E463
What, say it?

DOCTOR E463
I think its DOCTOR is actually how you really say it but if you were to say it phonetically it's DOCTOR or something like that.  DOCTOR.

PATIENT E463
Alright.

DOCTOR E463
DOCTOR um.

PATIENT E463
You donna ask me about how my uh acupuncture went?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah, I just read that note.

PATIENT E463
It was amazing.

DOCTOR E463
How'd it go, really?

PATIENT E463
Now the first time DOCTOR oh she's fascinating.

DOCTOR E463
Really.

PATIENT E463
I thought she was hooked up with the guy on TV.

DOCTOR E463
Oh yeah.

PATIENT E463
But no anyway, she got worried because of my pacemaker.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
So I got cleared.  Well she went and did it but once she got me clear.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
The next time I come back she hit me with all the juice they had in that baby.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
Whoa that was a wake-up call.  But she said now she's gonna do it every other month instead of every month.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
But I feel better, really a lot better.

DOCTOR E463
Good.

PATIENT E463
And what wasn't supposed to be affected by it was my knee and that got really better.

DOCTOR E463
Good, I'm really happy for you.

PATIENT E463
Unbelievable.  I don't know how it, you know.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
My shoulder got better which was what, you know the arthritis part but the knee and she hooked up the needles with the electricity transmitters and I said how much power are you putting in that sucker, my knee feels like it's coming apart?  She said that now that I know you're cleared from the pacemaker I'm gonna hook you up with the juice.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
Oh it's only 20 minutes yeah.

DOCTOR E463
That's good.

PATIENT E463

DOCTOR E463
Let me @@@ I think I need acupuncture.  My @@@ has been hurting me the last two days.  I didn't even sleep last night.  @@@.  Okay um.  So I wrote in my note about the six months versus one year so that @@@ remember I have it @@@.  Um okay so no more knee pain huh?

PATIENT E463
No.

DOCTOR E463
Good.  All because of the acupuncture?

PATIENT E463
It’s gotta be.  Cause I really had, you know I mean I had some of the you know Vicodin.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
And stuff but you know I mean they was helping it but, that really helped it like right away the next day.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
I felt it you know.  But she said the good thing about your situation she said I could exercise six days a week.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah that was true.

PATIENT E463
For two hours a day you know, all the leg did and all this.  She said that's what makes yours work better for you.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
Because of the constant daily exercise so acupuncture with exercise works good right now so.  That's a cool science that they did.  Watching her doing it is just amazing.  

DOCTOR E463
No chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT E463

PATIENT E463
It was a month ago, within the last month.

DOCTOR E463

PATIENT E463
I don't know if they replaced it or not.  I think they replaced it.

DOCTOR E463
Let's see.  They changed the @@@.  Okay.  And then your cholesterol is good, that's good and you're still taking the same meds or have they changed those around for you?

PATIENT E463
For what?

DOCTOR E463

DOCTOR E463
The cholesterol medications.

PATIENT E463
Oh no that's all the same, that's all the same yeah.

DOCTOR E463
And you're still following in the Lipid Clinic?

PATIENT E463
Yeah.  Well I haven't been there in a while but they don't usually see me too often.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
You know I want to make something a point to you, just nothin’ personal but.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
I have to tell somebody cause it's bugging me.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
You know I get a lot of medications.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
I get them through the mail.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
You know and I've had a run in over the phone with the Pharmacy about and I tell them, how come I'm running out already?

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
You know and they're like I'm not scheduled to get some or you must be using too many of them.  I said no I'm not.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
So after that argument, which was a couple months ago, I started emptying the bottles when I get them and counting them.  They're short count.

DOCTOR E463
Oh really.

PATIENT E463
Now what?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
With all the patients here, sometimes it's three, sometimes it's five, that's the maximum but you know how many pills you can you know.

DOCTOR E463
I know.

PATIENT E463
How big that is, that you know prescription drugs?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
I mean I only go by what I hear on TV but that's a big market nowadays.

DOCTOR E463
Okay so there's a lot of medicines that you were out of, like you said.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
I'm gonna renew all of them and @@@.

PATIENT E463
Right.

DOCTOR E463
So 90 days supplies.

PATIENT E463
Oh thank you.

DOCTOR E463
So those are renewed.  Some of them you're on 30 days.

PATIENT E463
Well I hope nobody's stealing this stuff.  I mean I almost think somebody is.  Those drugs that get on the street are coming from pharmacies, no matter what kind of pharmacist.  If it's Walgreens or CVS or the hospitals you know but they're coming from pharmacies cause they're all prescription drugs.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
And the worst one I heard about, I heard it today on a special on TV OxyContin.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
Am I saying that right?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.  Oxycodone.

PATIENT E463
That's synthetic heroin.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
I didn't know that until I saw that show on TV.  They have some good shows on TV sometimes, the informative ones you know.

DOCTOR E463
I'm gonna renew a bunch of your meds, okay.  I'm pretty good this year.  I've been pretty good every time you called I renewed it.  Do you want to keep it that way or should I renew the ones that you're running low on right now?  How do you want to do this?  It's up to you.

PATIENT E463
I can still renew them.

DOCTOR E463
Huh?

PATIENT E463
I can still renew them.  I keep up with it pretty good.

DOCTOR E463
Are you, do you have a good supply of all your meds right now?

PATIENT E463
Yeah.  I don't let it get too low though.  I just.

DOCTOR E463
Do you call before they run out?

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
Okay good.

PATIENT E463
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR E463
So why don't we just do that.  Is there anything that you might be running of soon?

PATIENT E463
No.

DOCTOR E463
No okay, why don't we just do that.  Cause there's so many meds here.

PATIENT E463
Yeah I do it all.

DOCTOR E463
And it's just better to do it as you run out I think okay.

PATIENT E463
Okay.

DOCTOR E463
And then that way I can put in the order that way.  Um otherwise looks like you're doing really well.  You're due for a repeat colonoscopy next year so I won't be putting in the order or maybe I will before I leave cause I only have another 10 months up here and you know.

PATIENT E463
Don't start that.

DOCTOR E463
I graduate in June.

PATIENT E463
And then what are you gonna do?

DOCTOR E463
Um I'm applying for Rheumatology right now so.

PATIENT E463
Here?

DOCTOR E463
All over the Midwest.

PATIENT E463
Oh.

DOCTOR E463
So I don't know if I'll get it here but somewhere I will.

PATIENT E463
Cause the doctor I had here for it she left.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah well we're only here for three years.

PATIENT E463
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E463
That's the maximum that we can stay here for internal medicine.  Question, have you actually had a heart attack before?

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
You have okay.

PATIENT E463
Well they said two.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
Cause that was my thought I don't know.

DOCTOR E463
Right.

PATIENT E463
But they said that's the reason they wouldn't operate on my knee.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
I had one during my first operation.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
And then when I wanted the second operation for them to reconstruct you know, take the colostomy bag out?

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
They said there's a possibility you'll have another heart attack, I said I don't care cause I don't want to live with this and I had another heart attack they said.  I mean I can only go with what they told me otherwise.  Cause I was already here but I don't know you know.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.  So nothing else right today?

PATIENT E463
Not really you know.

DOCTOR E463
You look good.

PATIENT E463
Something that concerns me every once in a while and I don't know.  In the morning when I get up I check my blood pressure and do all my stuff to know on the machine, my blood pressure's usually high in the morning.

DOCTOR E463
Like how high?

PATIENT E463
140-150.

DOCTOR E463
Were you doing anything before then, were you?

PATIENT E463
Sleeping.

DOCTOR E463
Sleeping.  We could start you on something else if you'd like.

PATIENT E463
Then it goes down you know as the day goes on.

DOCTOR E463
So how high does it go?

PATIENT E463
It goes down to 115, 120 and stays there basically.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
It never goes back up again, it's just the first.

DOCTOR E463
How high, what's the highest that you ever see?

PATIENT E463
170.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.  Then you probably need to be started on medicine then.  Let's see what you're on now.

PATIENT E463
But when it gets high the first time I check it two more times.

DOCTOR E463
You are on hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and metoprolol and that's it.  Basically there’s room to go up on them.  Do you follow a cardiologist?  A heart doctor?

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
Hydrochlorothiazide 25, lisinopril 10, we can increase the lisinopril to 20, 20 mg.

PATIENT E463
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR E463
We can do that.

PATIENT E463
Once a day or twice a day?

DOCTOR E463
Once a day.

PATIENT E463
Once a day.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
Oh I get 10 now.

DOCTOR E463
Right.

PATIENT E463
So all I got to do is take two.

DOCTOR E463
Right.

PATIENT E463
Until I get the new one yeah.

DOCTOR E463
So I'll go ahead and when the new one comes just taking two of them.  So when you go home you can take the other 10.  The metoprolol is already at 25.  Your heart rate was in the 60s so we'll keep that one also.  So yeah we'll do the lisinopril okay.

PATIENT E463
So I got 10 months with you huh?

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
Geez.

DOCTOR E463
So maybe just one more time.

PATIENT E463
Huh?

DOCTOR E463
Maybe cause I see you every six months.

PATIENT E463
You have to give me an autographed picture.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
I've lost a lot of good doctors this way.

DOCTOR E463
I know.

PATIENT E463
It gets sad afterwards, you know you get so attached to some people and then.

DOCTOR E463
I know.  So but that's just the way it is.

PATIENT E463
You don't get attached to patients do you?

DOCTOR E463
No I do, I mean.

PATIENT E463
Do you really yeah.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.  But the thing is like we're so overworked you know and then it's just sometimes.  Like today it's really easy for me and they only put three patients in my clinic so I'm like chilling and relaxing.  Now with the 30 residents we're supposed to have seven patients, they all cancelled today for some odd reason.

PATIENT E463
Friday.

DOCTOR E463
Fridays.

PATIENT E463
And it's nice out.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah right.

PATIENT E463
Did you call and tell me to come early or did somebody else?

DOCTOR E463
I didn’t.

PATIENT E463
No.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
They told me to come an hour earlier but see when I asked.  When I have an appointment to see you.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
I always call back and ask do you want me to do blood work.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
Because I usually assume that you want that.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
Oh no, no, no, then the next time I call I say you sure, oh yeah we changed our mind yeah get the blood work.

DOCTOR E463
Actually don't call them at that time cause I usually, I see so many people that I don't order the labs until the day before until I review.

PATIENT E463
Oh that's what they did yeah.

DOCTOR E463
So call like in the evening the day before.

PATIENT E463
Oh.

DOCTOR E463
And then be like hey do I need to come in for labs?  Do that from now on.

PATIENT E463
Cause it's not really a problem.

DOCTOR E463
Cause I always order like the day before Med Clinic cause I look at, cause I pre-write all my notes the day before you're coming in and then I look through the chart see what happened since the last time you've been here, do you need your labs, do you not need new labs, all of that stuff I do it the day before so otherwise I'll forget.  There are so many people I see and we get so many alerts for everybody like you need to do this and that or please do this, these are the results of this consult, it's not just one patient it's like 100 of them so.

PATIENT E463
Hmm.

DOCTOR E463
I try to do everything right before the appointment cause I want to know what's going on with you and I remember what to talk to you about and I know that okay this person needs labs, we need to get labs.  So call like on 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock the day before your appointment.

PATIENT E463
Okay.

DOCTOR E463
At least for the next nine months, ten months.  I don't know how some of the doctors can have their own system and things are a lot.

PATIENT E463
Do you know who's replacing you yet?

DOCTOR E463
Oh no they haven't even started yet.

PATIENT E463
No, they haven't even picked one.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah cause it's the academic year, so we're still training.

PATIENT E463
Alright.

DOCTOR E463
So every July is when new people come in.

PATIENT E463
So after when you graduate you're promoted?

DOCTOR E463
So I could technically be a full-fledged doctor and practice out in the world, the real world.

PATIENT E463
The real world.

DOCTOR E463
But I want to go specialize.

PATIENT E463
Oh.

DOCTOR E463
Real world meaning no one else is supervising me.  Like right now I have to go talk to an attending be like hey this is my.

PATIENT E463
DOCTOR?

DOCTOR E463
DOCTOR.

PATIENT E463
Right.

DOCTOR E463
This is what I'm gonna do for this patient, do you agree with me and so if they agree or disagree.

PATIENT E463
Is there any particular hospital that you like?

DOCTOR E463
Well I don't know like I don't have any.

PATIENT E463
You don't have anything checked.

DOCTOR E463
Long term I don't plan on staying in the Chicago area.

PATIENT E463
Oh really.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.  It's not just the doctors and the traffic is @@@.

PATIENT E463
It isn't?  Why not?

DOCTOR E463
You pay; you pay a lot in malpractice.

PATIENT E463
Oh really.

DOCTOR E463
@@@.

PATIENT E463
But we're so crazy, they teach us how to sue @@@.

DOCTOR E463
@@@ no like when you spend, I don't know, @@@ million dollars on medical school, your medical education and you're having the loans like, getting like a regular job isn't gonna cut it and so you're paying back loans and then you have like a certain lifestyle that you want to maintain you know it's just not gonna cut it.  Like when you have and let's say you're married to another doctor with same amount of loans that's like half a million dollars simply in loans.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
And that just fills up over the years you know so and then the once who do start practicing if half of that money goes to wherever and by the time you're done training you're 30 so by the time you even finish everything and pay everything off you're like what in your 50s.

PATIENT E463
How old are you?

DOCTOR E463
I'm young.  I'm younger than most people.

PATIENT E463
How old is young?

DOCTOR E463
26.

PATIENT E463
Really, the same age as my granddaughter.

DOCTOR E463
So I'm 26 but usually people graduate medical school at 26 but I'm like, well I'll be 27 soon but I'm like two years.

PATIENT E463
What does your husband do?

DOCTOR E463
Fiancée.

PATIENT E463
Oh fiancée.

DOCTOR E463
He went here but he um he's doing a fellowship in Cardiology in Detroit.

PATIENT E463
Another doc.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
Well then you can open a clinic on your own.

DOCTOR E463
Maybe but he's in Detroit and I don't really want to go to Detroit.

PATIENT E463
Oh no me neither.

DOCTOR E463
No.

PATIENT E463
I've been there, didn't like it.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah so I don't know.

PATIENT E463
Dirty city and dangerous city.

DOCTOR E463
I know.  He's right outside @@@ out there.  Like even if we lived @@@ side I don't care.  @@@.  So let me, I'll be right back.

PATIENT E463
Okay.  But you tell me to go to the 13th floor to check on that.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah go to the 13th floor.  Check on and see if you can reschedule the biopsy date.

PATIENT E463
I will.

DOCTOR E463
And if they say no you should see a doctor again um and I could write down the name of the doctor who saw you.

PATIENT E463
Yeah write on there.

DOCTOR E463
That way one of the clerks can look up the.

PATIENT E463
He's on the 13th then right?

DOCTOR E463
He might not be there today but the clerk will be there today.

PATIENT E463
Okay.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
That's called the GI Lab?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
GI Clinic.

DOCTOR E463
Wherever you want for, okay I'll see, yeah you can just go up to the GI Lab and the name of the doctor you saw DOCTOR, that's the name of the doctor.

PATIENT E463
Oh right.

DOCTOR E463
You don't have to say it just show them.

PATIENT E463
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR E463
@@@.

PATIENT E463
DOCTOR, no?

DOCTOR E463
Give me a second (doctor makes a phone call).  Um okay.

PATIENT E463
Does this hot weather bother you?

DOCTOR E463
Uh uh.

PATIENT E463
Not at all.

DOCTOR E463
I like it.

PATIENT E463
I figured you did.

DOCTOR E463
It's cause I'm @@@.

PATIENT E463
I know that.  You know I’m kidding.

DOCTOR OUT:  71:40  DOCTOR IN:  77:26

DOCTOR E463
Alright.  So my attending wants me to renew all the meds that have a 0 or a 1 next to it.

PATIENT E463
Okay.

DOCTOR E463
So that's what I'll do so you might get a huge influx of pills in the mail.

PATIENT E463
No problem.  I'll use them eventually.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah, you will.

PATIENT E463
I was gonna tell you something.  Where I go to work out at.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
My so-called trainer.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
She's from India.  Her name is uh NAME.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
I asked her how come she never used a towel or nothing, she says cause I don't sweat.  How can you not sweat?

DOCTOR E463
Well you know, I used to not sweat and then now every time I work out I do sweat so.

PATIENT E463
Right.  It's it because you're hair or what?

DOCTOR E463
No that's just um, that's just genetic.  I wouldn't even say it's.

PATIENT E463
Oh really.

DOCTOR E463
I think it's just some people sweat, some people.  Cause I know a lot of Indian men they sweat like.

PATIENT E463
Crazy right yeah.  She told me she was going to India one time, I said I ought to take a trip over there to visit you know see what it's like.

DOCTOR E463
Do you still take the ciprofloxacin, the antibiotic?  No, that's for the biopsy probably so.

PATIENT E463
Ciprofloxacin.

DOCTOR E463
That was for the prostate probably.

PATIENT E463
No, I guess I don't.  No yeah that's right yeah.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
She said I wouldn't last two days in India.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.  Probably not.

PATIENT E463
She says the way you are and the way I know you she says you wouldn't make it.  You'd be crying to get back here.

DOCTOR E463
We're gonna make everything a 90-day supply for three refills.

PATIENT E463
Hmm good.

DOCTOR E463
You still use the bowel regimen, the Senna tablets?

PATIENT E463
Who?

DOCTOR E463
The Senna?  

PATIENT E463
Yeah, yeah right.  I had to think about it yeah.

DOCTOR E463
Do you need more of the lancets to check your blood sugar?

PATIENT E463
Huh?

DOCTOR E463
Do you need more lancets?

PATIENT E463
No.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
I keep most of that stuff up pretty good.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.  Do you need more strips?

PATIENT E463
No.

DOCTOR E463
And what about the chlorhexidine for your mouth?

PATIENT E463
The uh mouthwash?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
No I keep that ordered so I keep ahead of it also.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.

PATIENT E463
That's good stuff.

DOCTOR E463
Oh yeah.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.  It's like drinking prostrate I mean what do you call that um peroxide and alcohol together.  That's what it tastes like to me.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
It really refreshes you yeah.

DOCTOR E463
Um I think that's it.  So we'll do six months and we'll be seeing you then, sound good?  You’re not due for anything today.

PATIENT E463
What does that mean?

DOCTOR E463
Like a health maintenance like vaccines and things like that okay.  You already got them last time so um things look good.

PATIENT E463
So I'm good to go huh till the next time.

DOCTOR E463
You are good to go till the next time.  So just keep calling in your medication orders so that you're not running out and I'll also be on top of it.

PATIENT E463
The only time I got to make an appointment is to see you?

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh so oh one more thing.  You don't have to go upstairs.

PATIENT E463
Why?

DOCTOR E463
Um I'm just gonna send a little note to the.

PATIENT E463
To the doctor.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
Oh okay.

DOCTOR E463
And then they can just do it.

PATIENT E463
Yep.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.  

PATIENT E463
Alright.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah. (Someone came to the door)  And what's the best way that they can reach you at?  What's the best number?

PATIENT E463
My main phone number.

DOCTOR E463
Your main phone number.

PATIENT E463
Yeah because I got voice mail on it so.

DOCTOR E463
Okay.  And what's your main phone number again?

PATIENT E463
NUMBER.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
NUMBER.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
NUMBER.

DOCTOR E463
Okay um.

PATIENT E463
Do you have any younger kids in your family?

DOCTOR E463
I'm the youngest.

PATIENT E463
You're young, you're a baby huh.

DOCTOR E463
I'm the only child yes.

PATIENT E463
Okay.  You know one thing that tickles me.  I have a lot of Indian people who live in my building.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
More than it used to be but now more so.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
And with all, always the same with most of them, especially the women and the kids, they must train them when they're growing up.  The women, they just go out of their way to do stuff for me I mean my God.  I say thank you, thank you, you're really a guest, you're always @@@ and they're so pleasant.  You know they even teach the kids.  The kids you know come up to me like I'm a God or something, it's serious.  You know they're so cute I feel like I got a big family you know and I got them all on my floor.  They always come out and speak to me you know.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
Yeah they're real nice.

DOCTOR E463
Well that's good.

PATIENT E463
They're a friendly people, really nice.  The kids are very polite.

DOCTOR E463
We're so friendly that we let every other country rule us historically.

PATIENT E463
Historically.

DOCTOR E463
Historically.

PATIENT E463
Yeah I seen all the movies about the British one day.

DOCTOR E463
The British.

PATIENT E463
They were taking all the.

DOCTOR E463
The @@@, the Muslims.

PATIENT E463
There was a lot of Muslims in India still though right?

DOCTOR E463
I mean it's, people are pretty peaceful in India.  There's no problem within the Muslims.  I mean like I have so many Muslim friends in India that's fine, there's no @@@.

PATIENT E463
I had a situation with a white lady.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
Old grumpy one.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
We're on the elevator getting off at the same time to go check our mail.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
There's a Muslim lady.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
Right and there's another Indian lady.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
They got off this elevator but I was talking to them on the elevator.  She gets off, she says, what do you think about them people?  What are you talking about?  Well them two.  What about them?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
Did they say something to you?  No.  Then what are you talking about?  That Muslim lady had the greatest outfit on you know it was trimmed and sewn well I was complimenting her on it at any rate.

DOCTOR E463
You know lots of time.

PATIENT E463
People are stupid.

DOCTOR E463
Unfortunately right now in America because of 9/11 and everything else that's going on around the world it's unfortunate cause if you think about it I mean like lots of Christians will wear necklaces with a cross on it but no one thinks anything of it you know.  So a lot of Muslim women will wear the scarf so that's just part of their cultural get up.

PATIENT E463
Right, right.

DOCTOR E463
So for us it's more that oh they're being oppressed but some of them would actually want to wear it you know.  I mean I wouldn't want to cause I wasn't raised that way but there's like your.

PATIENT E463
Who was the doctor you replaced?

DOCTOR E463
She was Muslim.

PATIENT E463
Okay.

DOCTOR E463
And she doesn't.

PATIENT E463
I couldn't remember her name.

DOCTOR E463
DOCTOR.

PATIENT E463
When she first came here and she was my doctor right.

DOCTOR E463
@@@.

PATIENT E463
She was @@@.  But I was talking to her about it a couple of times, she started laughing.

DOCTOR E463
Well no so I think lots of times it, just one of their goals so I think they dedicate one year to wearing it, it's kind of like they're being very good.  Sort of doing this through the @@@.  I mean I don't know, I'm not Muslim so I don't know any of those reasons or what was behind it but then they do it, so they'll dedicate themselves to one year basically and they'll wear it and then after that they'll carry on with a normal life without wearing it.

PATIENT E463
Are you a Christian?

DOCTOR E463
No I'm Hindu.

PATIENT E463
Who?

DOCTOR E463
Hindu, Hindu.

PATIENT E463
Are you?

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
Really.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.  Most Indians are Hindu.  If they're not Hindu.

PATIENT E463
Most?

DOCTOR E463
Most Indians are Hindu.

PATIENT E463
Cause like one lady she was trying to teach me about.

DOCTOR E463
If they are nurses and teachers, for some reason they tend to be Christian.

PATIENT E463
Yeah I noticed that yeah.

DOCTOR E463
And that's all the nurses here.

PATIENT E463
Christian.

DOCTOR E463
Like they are Christian and its funny cause in India most of the Christians are from this one state called Corolla and they have the highest literacy rate.  They're the most educated in terms of English that kind of thing so.  They tend to be, now it's a lot better but back in the day it had the highest literacy rate.

PATIENT E463
One of those ladies tried to show, she gave me a Hindu calendar.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
With some gods on it.

DOCTOR E463
@@@.

PATIENT E463
And I'm like where is the rest of this calendar I wanted to buy a drink.

DOCTOR E463
I don't understand it.  My mom doesn't understand it.  We just listen to like.

PATIENT E463
What's that die you do?

DOCTOR E463
With the henna?

PATIENT E463
Yeah henna that's it.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
I see on her eyes what is that?

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
Is that a tattoo?  She said no.

DOCTOR E463
My grandmother actually has a tattoo.  It's common back in the day for even the women to get tattoos.  It's like a symbol for God or something.  At the end of the day I think every religion is actually very similar, some people just have to learn to accept you know.  See what I don't like is somebody knocking on my door trying to convert me to something else.  That I don't appreciate.  I don't mind what religion anyone else is and I respect that religion but don't expect me to convert.

PATIENT E463
Okay but your Hindu but you believe in God.

DOCTOR E463
Right.

PATIENT E463
How many Gods are there, I mean really?

DOCTOR E463
There's a lot.

PATIENT E463
Huh there's a lot be we all have one God.

DOCTOR E463
Right.

PATIENT E463
Basically you know.  We can call Him anything we want you know.

DOCTOR E463
The thing with Hinduism we've still got one supreme person.

PATIENT E463
Right.

DOCTOR E463
Who has all these other little Gods.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.  There's some weird looking Gods.

DOCTOR E463
Right, yeah.  They're all serving @@@.

PATIENT E463
Oh my goodness.

DOCTOR E463
There's a story.  It's the story behind it.  

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
You can't just literally.  It's the story behind it.  But there's a, what's it called, not a mesh but there's a morale behind each story and why the God is that way but that's the story @@@.

PATIENT E463
One of my most favorite movies on cable about Indian people is Monsoon Wedding.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
You saw that?

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
I loved that.  Every time it comes on I watch it again cause it really gets into that family thing.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
You know it brings it right in and they show it quite a bit too.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah they do.

PATIENT E463
That's a good movie, good movie.

DOCTOR E463
So yeah.

PATIENT E463
What I don't understand about India is how they look at slavery of the women the way they do the young ones.

DOCTOR E463
There's an area, an area @@@ that are very progressive.  So rich in India is you will never find that kind of lifestyle anywhere in the world.  That's how unusual their lives are.  In terms of that everything is marble.  It's like the rich are very rich in India and the poor are @@@.

PATIENT E463
Really poor yeah.

DOCTOR E463
Really poor and just recently the middle class has been getting large and happy.  They're actually happy about their lifestyle and everything like that.  Now everyone's getting a car.  Before no one had, my parents never grew up around cars you know.  My dad walked to school, you know that kind of thing um but yeah.  So I mean and everything is changing for the better except for the poor in India.  The only thing that, with the population that big you're gonna have poor people.  That's just I think.

PATIENT E463
How many allow really young girls to get husbands?  I thought about like 12, 13, 14?  

DOCTOR E463
My grandmother was 8 when she was married.

PATIENT E463
Eight, you're kidding.

DOCTOR E463
They didn't move in with my grandfather until she was 16 though.

PATIENT E463
Well how she was married then?

DOCTOR E463
The ceremony, religiously, the ceremony.

PATIENT E463
Oh they were married but.

DOCTOR E463
They were married but she still lived at home.

PATIENT E463
Oh.

DOCTOR E463
Until 16 so.  At least and each state is different but in our state we had a lot of Muslim people and so I think it was custom.  I don't know back in the day in Christian societies when you are born they decided who you were gonna marry.  It's kind of like well you two are gonna get married together.

PATIENT E463
They still do that.

DOCTOR E463
They still do that.

PATIENT E463
Yeah I know they do cause that's this girl I know.  That's how she got and met her husband.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah so that's how they do it but in Indian they actually go ahead and do the ceremony all together and lots of time with the Muslim people they respected married women or girls but they didn't respect unmarried ones so then things that shouldn't happen happened so in our area there were a lot of strikes, back in the day, between Muslims and Hindus and all the other stuff.  But because they respected Hindu women and their sacredness, they left those girls alone.

PATIENT E463
Did they.  Why when women get in a car with like a man's going and some of them are going why do the women sit in the back seat?

DOCTOR E463
Um you mean if there's a taxi driver?

PATIENT E463
No I'm not talking about a taxi I'm talking about a residential car.  The man gets in the front and drives and the women sit in the back like if there's two women they sit in the back.

DOCTOR E463
I don't know.

PATIENT E463
In my building they do a lot.  I see it a lot.

DOCTOR E463
My building doesn't do that at all.

PATIENT E463
No.

DOCTOR E463
Uh uh, so I don't know.  In India if there's a driver, if you have a driver.

PATIENT E463
Probably different.

DOCTOR E463
If you have a driver that's hired that's when you only sit in the back.  You never sit in the front.

PATIENT E463
Yeah well that makes more sense.

DOCTOR E463
And if you're in the front it's the man that's in the front.

PATIENT E463
Right.

DOCTOR E463
Cause you don't want the taxi driver getting into your whatever it is.  But it's just custom.  Cause they're a different class, you would sit in the back, it's a different class so.  Working class versus not working class basically so.

PATIENT E463
Is it true that Indian people don't bury their dead?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah we cremate.

PATIENT E463
They cremate right?

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
If we had to bury a billion people there would be no place for them.

PATIENT E463
There was no place to bury them right?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah so.

PATIENT E463
That's what I heard.

DOCTOR E463
So it's better that way.

PATIENT E463
I seen it in a movie.  They don't bring that up too much.  You don't hear too much about that.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah that's cause other cultures cremate too.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
Some Christians cremate.

PATIENT E463
That's what I've got decided for me, cremation.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
I says yeah sure.  What do I care about the funeral?

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
You know cremate me and get it over with, it doesn't make any difference.  Throw me somewhere, I don't know.  Spread my ashes over Lake Michigan or something whatever you want to do.  Yeah.  I love to study other cultures but you know.

DOCTOR E463
Oh yeah, it’s really cool.

PATIENT E463
India is a very interesting place you know.  I seen old movies from the.

DOCTOR E463
Well the thing is in India there's so many different, it's very tribal and each state.

PATIENT E463
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR E463
Also has its own religion so it's almost like separate countries and each type of Indian follows one God and it's very confusing.

PATIENT E463
Yeah oh I got a case for you.  In my building I met this, this family.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
This lady and her husband and her son right.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
And all of a sudden she had, she had to go back to India.  Her husband died, that's what it was.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
Her husband died and her and her son had to go back to India.  

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
I said why, cause they were never married.  He was an American citizen but she never married him so she got nothing.

DOCTOR E463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E463
So she got deported basically.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT E463
That was kind of a bummer.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah.

PATIENT E463
You know the kid too.  He was crying cause he didn't want to go back.  He seen it and didn't like it.

DOCTOR E463
Yeah it's unfortunate.  Like now, there's a lot of medical couples that @@@ actually study in Nassau.  Like half of them are in America, the other half is in India.  I know a couple of my cousins who are my age they came to America.  Because in America you have to work.  If you work you'll get the benefits in most cases right.  In India if you already have money you don't have to work.  You can live a long amazing life without working if your family has money and my cousin's family they have money so they didn't want to work here.  Especially the girl she could be a nice housewife and like her husband's rich, like he owns like a construction company which is huge now because it's like a booming economy there.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
So she's just gonna go ahead and primarily do the whole housewife thing you know and the thing is in India you have servants for everything.  You have a cook.  Every middle class family has a servant.  In America we're cleaning our own bathrooms and we're doing everything even though we're doctors and lawyers or whatever you make.  We're still getting down on all fours and scrubbing our floors.  You know unless you hire somebody but even then it's more expensive here and there it's dirt cheap.

PATIENT E463
Yeah.

DOCTOR E463
You know so I mean for those reasons a couple of my cousins went back because I don't want to do this.  I had a much better life in India you know so.

PATIENT E463
But that's what they do, they come and you know get married, you gotta go back.  Like the woman when her husband died.  She's not an American citizen.

DOCTOR E463
Well it depends on the visa that she came on.

PATIENT E463
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR E463
If she's on a school visa then once she finishes school then that's it she has to go back you know.  But her kid if the kid was born in America they can technically stay but obviously he could go with his mom so.  So that's that.  There's lot of stories like that so.

PATIENT E463
Yeah I remember the old movies with what was it Darren Grant the Bengal dancers.

DOCTOR E463
