Uh I have to get my primary care doctor to go take an @@@.

DOCTOR E413
Okay for the, for the neurosurgeons?

PATIENT E413
Right.

DOCTOR E413
Okay, okay.

PATIENT E413
So whatever's the tests but they wanted me to have this before the surgery, presurgery stuff that they.  I mean they got to do that part but they wanted me to have, it's usually on here whatever they wanted me to do but I.

DOCTOR E413
Are they at Hines where you saw them?

PATIENT E413
Right exactly.

DOCTOR E413
Okay so that's not gonna be in here necessarily.  Let me see if I could uh.

PATIENT E413
There's something you had to do I forgot what.

DOCTOR E413
Did they want a Cardiology?

PATIENT E413
Right, there you go.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.  Unfortunately I have to send you to another doctor for that.

PATIENT E413
You have to send me to another doctor for that?

DOCTOR E413
Yeah.  It's just that well this is the Primary Care Clinic right.

PATIENT E413
Right.

DOCTOR E413
So your Cardiology Clinic does things with the cardiologists unfortunately.  Is there a particular reason they wanted it?

SECOND PERSON E413
He had a heart attack.

DOCTOR E413
He had a heart attack.

PATIENT E413
Right around Christmas.

SECOND PERSON E413
December 23rd.

PATIENT E413
I didn't come to this hospital I had you know I went to uh.

SECOND PERSON E413
To Christ's.

DOCTOR E413
Oh you were at the Christ okay.  Did they put any stent in?

PATIENT E413
No stents they gave me a thing where they go into your groin @@@.

DOCTOR E413
Oh a cardiac cath.

PATIENT E413
They did that, found no blockage, none of that.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.

PATIENT E413
No.

DOCTOR E413
Why did they think you had a heart attack then?

PATIENT E413
They didn't say.  I probably was stressed out @@@.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah.

PATIENT E413
I'd seen the doctors the day before that and they gave me all this stuff about this leg, that's what started all this in motion.

DOCTOR E413
Gotcha, gotcha, okay.  So you had a car, so that cath was in December right?

PATIENT E413
That was yeah, December probably 22nd.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.

PATIENT E413
I got out of the hospital on Christmas.

DOCTOR E413
Okay and so the reason they did the cath was because you were having chest pain?

PATIENT E413
Right, real bad chest pain.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.

PATIENT E413
And they said I had an abnormal test.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.

PATIENT E413
And there was no blood tests they couldn't do it, it hurt.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.  And your cath was normal.

PATIENT E413
Right.  All that was normal, they said no damage to the heart, nothing was abnormal.

DOCTOR E413
So what it sounds like to me, it sounds like you didn't actually have a heart attack.

PATIENT E413
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E413
Um sounds like you could have, that's the reason they did it is because they were concerned that you did.

PATIENT E413
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E413
But they didn't find any evidence that you had a heart attack.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
You didn't have any heart blockages.  It could have just been chest pain from something else.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
Um also that's hard to say because @@@.

PATIENT E413
They didn’t say that.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah exactly.  Um none the less I understand why the surgeons would kind of hesitant.

PATIENT E413
Okay.  I didn't tell him that.  

DOCTOR E413
Why you didn't tell then, I don't know where.

PATIENT E413
I didn't tell him about the heart thing, DOCTOR.  I didn't even tell him that.  I don't know where he knew anything about it.

DOCTOR E413
Let me see.

PATIENT E413
Oh it might be in the @@@.

SECOND PERSON E413
In their notes.  Yeah it's in there.

PATIENT E413
Yeah I told them.  I told the EMG they were in there.

DOCTOR E413
Okay so you just, I see it.  Yeah they didn't say they wanted a Cardiology clearance.  They just said preop medical clearance.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
Oh yeah so since you had, actually you don't need to see your cardiologist necessarily because since you had that test that's the ultimate definite test for you know your heart disease.

PATIENT E413
Right.

DOCTOR E413
And you had it and it was normal so.

PATIENT E413
Sent me home and I don't have to.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah so I think that's fine.  Um we're okay with that let's just make sure all your other medicines are well optimized here.  

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
Your blood pressure looks good.  Your heart rate looks good.  Are you taking all of your medicines?

PATIENT E413
Except the gem something.

DOCTOR E413
Gemfibrozil?

PATIENT E413
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E413
Why is that?

PATIENT E413
Uh yeah I think this is for cholesterol right?

DOCTOR E413
Yeah.

PATIENT E413
I got real scared of cholesterol medicines since I had that.

DOCTOR E413
Right.

PATIENT E413
@@@ before.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah.

PATIENT E413
And if somebody said cholesterol medicine I, that was the worst feeling, I was having those cramps.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah.

PATIENT E413
@@@ that day.

DOCTOR E413
I understand. This medicine, this is why, cause I knew about it that's why I started you on a different type of medicine.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
Totally different class.  It doesn't have the side effect.  Sometimes the only side effects you really have is kind of a weird taste.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
Um some people get a little bit of a stomach upset.

PATIENT E413
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E413
But you don't, you don't get those side effects like you got from the statin drugs like the Lipitor, things like that.

PATIENT E413
Right the cramps.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah you don't get those kinds of side effects.

PATIENT E413
Okay well I'll take it.

DOCTOR E413
But you haven't taken it at all huh?

PATIENT E413
I wasn't no.

DOCTOR E413
You don't okay.

PATIENT E413
Okay.  I tell you that, that's the worst feeling I've ever had in my life.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah I get that, I understand okay.  

PATIENT E413
But I will start that so, if you say that.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah that's why I hope I mean I probably didn't explain it to you as well last time.  But that's why yeah; you know you should never get that other statin because you've had.

PATIENT E413
Right.

DOCTOR E413
A bad side effect before.  Are you having any, do you have any chest pain at all or anything like that since you had it that one time?

PATIENT E413
No.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.  Any shortness of breath?

PATIENT E413
No.

DOCTOR E413
Okay um coughing anything like that?

PATIENT E413
No.

DOCTOR E413
Okay and your dizziness I understand is about the weakness.  The weakness is about the same?

PATIENT E413
Oh the weakness oh yeah that's about the same.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.

PATIENT E413
Yeah that's in my legs and stuff there.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.

PATIENT E413
And that's why I'm having surgery so it possibly don't get any worse.

DOCTOR E413
Right.

PATIENT E413
They talking two different things that could be the cause of it but if I don't @@@ possibly to stop it, it's just gonna get worse regardless so they say the decompression will stop it from getting any worse.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.

PATIENT E413
If that, indeed is the cause and not the neuropathy.

DOCTOR E413
Right exactly, exactly.  They feel, the way I understand it, they feel that it would be better if you had the surgery.

PATIENT E413
Right.

DOCTOR E413
And it might stop the progress of it.

PATIENT E413
Right.

DOCTOR E413
That's what they're saying.

PATIENT E413
Yeah.

DOCTOR E413
Which is very reasonable.

PATIENT E413
It is.

DOCTOR E413
It could possibly do but you have to know the fact that it might not.

PATIENT E413
Not be I know yeah but I got to.

DOCTOR E413
It is a risky of surgery.

PATIENT E413
Yeah.

DOCTOR E413
Um okay.  So I was just looking through your medicines.  You do have an albuterol inhaler ordered.

PATIENT E413
Right.

DOCTOR E413
How often do you use that?

PATIENT E413
Hmm maybe once a week.

DOCTOR E413
Once a week okay.  Who gave that to you?

PATIENT E413
Uh I think you might have.

DOCTOR E413
Uh no, I think it was the doctor before me.

PATIENT E413
Okay right.

DOCTOR E413
Okay and uh.

PATIENT E413
I know I take it when I need it.

DOCTOR E413
Were you wheezing?

PATIENT E413
No just something like that.

DOCTOR E413
That's okay.  Did you ever have, have you ever had lung tests done or anything like that?

PATIENT E413
I think I had something for it, @@@.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.  How far can you walk before you get, I know you have this pain and everything.

PATIENT E413
@@@ I don't get out of breath.  It's not getting out of breath walking.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.

PATIENT E413
It's just @@@.

DOCTOR E413
Were you a smoker in the past?

PATIENT E413
Twenty years ago.

DOCTOR E413
How long did you smoke for?  How many years?

PATIENT E413
Okay 20 years ago, I was how old?

SECOND PERSON E413
41.

PATIENT E413
So I started smoking at 18.

DOCTOR E413
So you smoked for 25 years.

PATIENT E413
Yes.

DOCTOR E413
Okay so I think, I looked back and I couldn't find any lung function tests at all.

PATIENT E413
No.

DOCTOR E413
I think it's reasonable to maybe repeat those.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
But you only use that inhaler once or twice a week you said.

PATIENT E413
Right.  I just want to make sure I've got it.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.

PATIENT E413
Just to be safe, make sure I have it.

DOCTOR E413
That's fine.  So we can do those lung function tests later.  You don't have to have them before your surgery or anything like that.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
I don't think it's a pressing issue.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
Um and then you're doing okay with your depression medicine?

PATIENT E413
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E413
The @@@.

PATIENT E413
Yes.

DOCTOR E413
@@@ and limiting your salt okay.

PATIENT E413
Uh-huh.  Just the quarterback the Bears had at the end of the year, he had a pinch.  You better hurry up.

DOCTOR E413
Understandable.  Understandable.  Alright.  And now the one that @@@ this day, you said your test was at Christ?

PATIENT E413
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E413
Okay well you might have to, can, do you think you can get those records from Christ?

PATIENT E413
I think so.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.

PATIENT E413
But you probably could get them before I could.

DOCTOR E413
From Christ.  Okay we could try to.

PATIENT E413
But they got them, when I went them they got all my records from here like in the middle of the night almost.

DOCTOR E413
Right, right, maybe because they faxed them over.  Okay.

PATIENT E413
If you want to do it that way I don't know.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah I think, well we don't necessarily need them cause I can document it and that's fine for now because the surgeons.

PATIENT E413
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E413
Will want to see them.  Do you have like a pre-appointment with them or anything?

PATIENT E413
Not yet when I see you.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah.

PATIENT E413
Then I call her today and then she'll make all the preop things.

DOCTOR E413
Okay so yeah I think what I would do is try to get it from them, just so you have them.  We don't need them here, we're fine.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
But as far as they need them but they should be able to give it to you without a problem.

PATIENT E413
Okay I'll get it.

DOCTOR E413
Just say you had a negative test and things like that.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
And that'll make it, that'll make it easier for everybody.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
Okay so they're not asking you like why.

PATIENT E413
Yeah right.

DOCTOR E413
What the results were and things like that.  Any other problems at all today?

PATIENT E413
Uh that itching.  I have dry skin but man I just break out itching all over.  I get hot and itchy all over.

DOCTOR E413
Hmm.

PATIENT E413
Um once a week at least and I got dry skin cream but it's not doing it, I mean it itches and it's driving me crazy.

DOCTOR E413
Hmm.  Have you ever had that before?

PATIENT E413
Not like that.  It's been, it's been doing it for a while now but I've never asked about it or said anything about it, I just thought it was dry skin or the detergent that I was using.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah.

PATIENT E413
You know those kind of things.

DOCTOR E413
Any rashes at all anywhere?

PATIENT E413
I don't know if you call this a rash, it be almost like that.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah I think that's probably from scratching.

PATIENT E413
Yeah that's what I think.

DOCTOR E413
Do you think you have some dry skin maybe?

PATIENT E413
Yeah I do have dry skin and I have medicine for it but that itches sometime.  I do put a cream on it and it stops it.

DOCTOR E413
Do you put it on every day?

PATIENT E413
No.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.  I think what I would try first before we do anything else is try to use it every day.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
Even if you're not itchy it'll kind of help you with the itchiness.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.  Just know just trying to use it every day.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
And then.

PATIENT E413
I'll be very ashy if I don't use it every day, you can write, I could take my finger and I could write on my whole leg.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah I mean the dry skin probably that's what happens it kind of feeds itself.

PATIENT E413
Okay.

DOCTOR E413
Okay.  Let's have you sit up here, I'll take a listen at you. I got you.

PATIENT E413
There we go.  

DOCTOR E413
Any bowel or bladder or incontinence or anything like that?

PATIENT E413
No.

DOCTOR E413
Okay I know that probably everybody asks you that.

PATIENT E413
Everybody asks because that's the first doctor told me what I'm having now could cause that.

DOCTOR E413
Right I understand @@@.

PATIENT E413
@@@ after the surgery like big time.

DOCTOR E413
Yeah.

PATIENT E413
@@@.  I don't want that.  I take everything else but I don't want that.

DOCTOR E413
Deep breath.  Any leg swelling at all or anything like that?

PATIENT E413
