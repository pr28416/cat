DOCTOR T416
Oh yeah.

PATIENT T416
Constipation.

DOCTOR T416

PATIENT T416
And it's more the drug than anything else.  I just want to sleep that's all, yeah.

DOCTOR T416
So tell me about your sleeping, why can't you sleep?

PATIENT T416
I don't think they found me yet.

DOCTOR T416
Yeah.

PATIENT T416
It's @@@ but uh, I'm up three or four times a night.

DOCTOR T416

PATIENT T416
Uh yeah maybe once.

DOCTOR T416

PATIENT T416
I just can't sleep.

DOCTOR T416

PATIENT T416
A sleeping oh, you mean come in here and do a.

DOCTOR T416
Yes and do you know if you snore or that kind of thing?

PATIENT T416
No I don't snore.

DOCTOR T416
Yeah and the reason is, you when know they can see if you have sleep apnea if you have something causing to do that.  Is pain waking you up at all?  Pain in your legs?

PATIENT T416
Uh uh.

DOCTOR T416
Okay.  And I think last time we talked about good sleep hygiene is any of that helping you?  Like not watching TV and you know you're having dinner past 6, that should be fine, you're not drinking too water or caffeine before bed?

PATIENT T416
No definitely not.

DOCTOR T416
Okay.

PATIENT T416
In fact I only drink half a cup of coffee in the morning.

DOCTOR T416
Okay and then your bedroom is like quiet, dark.

PATIENT T416
Yeah.

DOCTOR T416
Okay.

PATIENT T416
I just can't sleep, that's all.

DOCTOR T416
Do you have bad dreams?

PATIENT T416
Everybody  had a bad dream every now and then but that doesn't, I just ignore that @@@.

DOCTOR T416
I'm just going to add that you have bad dreams.

PATIENT T416
This probably would have been okay but it's more of a you know it's just like I'm not depressed.

DOCTOR T416
Right, right.

PATIENT T416
So that's not that.

DOCTOR T416
Right, right. You take anti-depressants.

PATIENT T416
Yeah so that uh.

DOCTOR T416
Yeah and I still think a sleeping study would tell us why you can't sleep or at least rule some things out.  Okay you're taking, how much methadone are you taking?

PATIENT T416
About 7.

DOCTOR T416
So you'll be off of it soon.

PATIENT T416
Uh I don't believe so, I'm struggling with it, I'm ready to but uh.

DOCTOR T416
Yeah.  Let's see your blood pressure is high here, we'll recheck it again.  You're on amlodipine 10.

PATIENT T416
Uh yeah amlodipine.

DOCTOR T416
Okay did you take your medications today?

PATIENT T416
No.

DOCTOR T416
Oh, so that may be why it's high.

PATIENT T416
I usually don't take it until like about 9 o'clock.

DOCTOR T416
Okay.

PATIENT T416
You know.

DOCTOR T416
Well did we do labs on your today?

PATIENT T416
Uh yeah labs, I did the labs a week, Saturday I think.

DOCTOR T416
I think that was for the Liver Clinic though.

PATIENT T416
No you told me to do labs before I came.

DOCTOR T416
Yeah, well we didn't get them, oh, okay.  Okay.

PATIENT T416
And I think those are your labs so.

DOCTOR T416
Yeah cause these look like your HCV labs.  Yeah so you were, okay.  You last saw liver January 30th and they want, oh you're supposed to get another CT.

PATIENT T416
Yeah the 29th I believe.

DOCTOR T416
Oh the 29th, that's right okay.  Okay.  So you saw them just in January.

PATIENT T416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T416
So you'll get that CT for that liver testing.

PATIENT T416
Right.

DOCTOR T416
And they'll to you more about that.

PATIENT T416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T416
Okay.  Well your AFP is normal and are they saying that, are they saying that they are going to treat your hepatitis C though?

PATIENT T416
Yes.

DOCTOR T416
When are they going to do that?

PATIENT T416
Uh well actually this @@@.

DOCTOR T416
Okay.

PATIENT T416
So.  

DOCTOR T416
I was trying to see if there are any medications you're taking that, -- cause the problems with medications for sleep, a lot of them are bad for your liver.

PATIENT T416
Alright.

DOCTOR T416
And you have hepatitis C; I really don't want to give you anything you know some of the normal drugs we give for a liver, for sleep are very, very bad for liver patients.

PATIENT T416
Oh then I can go without sleeping.

DOCTOR T416
Oh, but that's why but I want to help you um but at the same time you know we can't really.

PATIENT T416
And I can go without the sleep if it’s bad for the liver; it's just not that, I can deal with it.

DOCTOR T416
Yeah.  So, yeah there's not as many medications that we can do for that um.  Let's see you’re 61 and you're on something for diabetes.  Your last A1c was good and you're taking the metformin and that's fine.

PATIENT T416
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR T416
Okay good.  We're doing just fine.

PATIENT T416
@@@ drop backwards, @@@ you know.

DOCTOR T416
Yeah.  And thrombocytosis, so for the hypertension you're just on amlodipine.

PATIENT T416
Hypertension?

DOCTOR T416
Yeah high blood pressure.

PATIENT T416
Oh okay.

DOCTOR T416
Yeah.  And you're on let's see.

PATIENT T416
When something runs out, usually as soon as I get one I'll call in uh and have it you know, they'll deliver it when the other one is out you know.  One of them I ran out of, I can't remember which one it was.

DOCTOR T416
Hmm.  Let's take a look.  

PATIENT T416
You might have redone it already.

DOCTOR T416
Yeah.

PATIENT T416
Cause this was, I believe, probably maybe a week ago, two weeks ago.

DOCTOR T416
Maybe the finasteride?  I recently, the nicotine patches were all gone, methadone, well, I don’t do the methadone.

PATIENT T416
Right.

DOCTOR T416
Tamsulosin, metformin?  You have refills.

PATIENT T416
That's probably what it was.

DOCTOR T416
Or aspirin maybe.

PATIENT T416
No I got it, it wasn't aspirin.  Like I say when I get it I order the next one so I have a.

DOCTOR T416
It might be the mirtazapine, you only one, you have 0 refills.

PATIENT T416

PATIENT T416

DOCTOR T416
Um and I'm going to talk to my attending about the sleep.  I mean honestly, I think the best thing to do is get a sleep study but if you're not really interested in doing that, you know.  I'll just see what my attending says and see if he's got any other ideas.  Um and then we'll go from there.  Now do me a favor, next time out, check your blood pressure at home and tell me what it is.

PATIENT T416
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  58:45  DOCTOR IN:  67:48)

DOCTOR T416
Alright.  We're going to do all those same things.  Um I'll see you in six months, but I think I am going to start the lisinopril actually.

PATIENT T416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T416
The other blood pressure medicine.  The other blood pressure medication.

PATIENT T416
Uh.

DOCTOR T416
I'd like to start it, there's a couple of reasons.  Um it's mainly a protective for your kidneys for people who have diabetes.

PATIENT T416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T416
Uh, so I'm going to start you on a small dose and have you come back, I'll have you come back in two weeks for a blood pressure check.

PATIENT T416
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T416
Um and I'll have you come back in two weeks, so you can get all your labs in two weeks actually.

PATIENT T416
Okay.

DOCTOR T416
@@@.  Yeah let's do that.  So in two weeks you'll come up here and we'll just check your blood pressure.

PATIENT T416
Okay.

DOCTOR T416
And in two weeks we'll check a BNP.

PATIENT T416
What's the BNP now?

DOCTOR T416
Your chemistry, electrolytes.

PATIENT T416
Okay.

DOCTOR T416
Your creatinine, that way cause sometimes the medication can have a little effect, usually for most people its fine um.  Can you pick up your medication today?

PATIENT T416
Sure.

DOCTOR T416
Okay.  And the one thing that’s good for sleep and liver disease is trazodone.

PATIENT T416
Okay.

DOCTOR T416
Um we can try that, a small dose of that.

PATIENT T416
Okay.

DOCTOR T416
And we'll see how you're doing and you know and we'll just take the mirtazapine off.

PATIENT T416
Okay.

DOCTOR T416
We know that it wasn't.  I think that's about it, let me see if there's anything else that I need to do uh and as far as, we'll try the trazodone and as far as sleep hygiene, things like exercising before bed can help.

PATIENT T416
But that's what I do.

DOCTOR T416
Okay.

PATIENT T416
I exercise, yeah.

DOCTOR T416
You do all that.

PATIENT T416

DOCTOR T416
What about eating before bed?

PATIENT T416
Yeah.

DOCTOR T416
Okay.

PATIENT T416
I start to try to exercise at 8 o'clock and I usually try to go to sleep about 9:30.

DOCTOR T416
Okay.

PATIENT T416
And I have no trouble going to sleep, just trouble staying asleep.

DOCTOR T416
So I want to take off your mirtazapine.  Oh it's expired anyway okay.  Okay, then that's pretty much it.  Okay.  And you start on the trazodone and then we should be good.

PATIENT T416
So you want me to do labs before the two weeks though right?

DOCTOR T416
