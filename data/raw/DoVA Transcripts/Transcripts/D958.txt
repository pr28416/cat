PATIENT D958

DOCTOR D958
I don't need @@@.

PATIENT D958
Old people are hard of hearing, you've got to @@@.

DOCTOR D958
So what's going on with the blood pressure?

PATIENT D958
What's the matter with it?

DOCTOR D958
Your blood pressure is high.

PATIENT D958
What?

DOCTOR D958
Your blood pressure was high.

PATIENT D958
Was what?

DOCTOR D958
High.

PATIENT D958
No it's not.  Not yet.  

DOCTOR D958
You can have a seat @@@.

PATIENT D958
Okay.

DOCTOR D958
@@@.

PATIENT D958
Alright.

DOCTOR D958
So you don't think it's high?

PATIENT D958
No.

DOCTOR D958
What's high for you?

PATIENT D958
Uh maybe if it gets up about 300 might be high.

DOCTOR D958
You @@@.

PATIENT D958
I only get, I know when my blood pressure's high, when I get a pain behind my eyes and my head hurts really bad then I know I got high blood pressure.  Other than that it works fine.

DOCTOR D958
So if it gets to that point it's @@@.

PATIENT D958
Uh it gets too low I can't do nothing, all I do is sit around and do nothing and pass out.

DOCTOR D958
And what's too low?

PATIENT D958
Uh what you people want 130 over whatever.  I can't get down that low.  If I go that low I can't move.

DOCTOR D958
Hmm.

PATIENT D958
I got to be able to have a little blood pressure.  It's just like in a car, when the oil pressure is high the car runs good.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
When my blood pressure's high I run good.

DOCTOR D958
Hmm.  See, the thing about your blood pressure going high is something getting to 300 that's um an impending stroke.

PATIENT D958
Huh?

DOCTOR D958
You should never feel your blood pressure, even if it's high you shouldn't feel it, that's you know, that's concerning cause it's a risk for stroke.

PATIENT D958
No I can feel it when it's high.

DOCTOR D958
That's what I'm saying cause that means it's getting way too high and its way too late.  It shouldn't be like that.

PATIENT D958
Oh well, where it's at now, it's not bad.  I would say fair to midland right there.  It goes down though.

DOCTOR D958
How low does it go?

PATIENT D958
It goes down pretty low after I'm up out of my car for a couple days.

DOCTOR D958
Out of your car?

PATIENT D958
Yeah.

DOCTOR D958
What do you mean?

PATIENT D958
Expressway driving.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
Gives me high blood pressure.

DOCTOR D958
Hmm.  Last time @@@.

PATIENT D958
Because I think there's close to 90 million of them out there that don't know how to drive.

DOCTOR D958
I agree with you.  That I cannot disagree with you.

PATIENT D958
My car is a testimony to that.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
My car is 15 years old and never been in an accident.  Young kid who lives out in the western suburbs drove all the way over by where my house is just to run into me.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
On my side of the street, he ran head on into me.

DOCTOR D958
Hmm.  When was that?

PATIENT D958
Uh just about a month and a half or two.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.  Did you get hit?

PATIENT D958
Huh?

DOCTOR D958
Did you get hit?

PATIENT D958
Did I get hurt?  Just my hand I uh sprained my wrist but it's alright now.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
Uh but the thing is.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
The insurance company wouldn't pay to fix my car.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
Because they said it was too old.  They gave me lot value for the car which is not what the car was worth.  That car was offered 20 grand for the damn thing and all they gave me for the car was $1800 to fix it and it was $3000 worth of damage.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
They only gave me $1800.  I was offered 20 grand for that car, that's $20,000 and I refused it you see.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
Because I liked that car.  It's a 96 Oldsmobile.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
It's the last one of its kind made.

DOCTOR D958
Oh really hmm.

PATIENT D958
So it was worth a lot of money.

DOCTOR D958
Yeah.

PATIENT D958
It was worth more than 20 grand seeing that it was the last one made.  The kid wanted to buy it, he offered me 20 for it, I told him to go home and get some more money.  He asked me how much I wanted for it and I said well seeing that it's the last one made you got a million dollars I'd sell it to you.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
But some other jerk had to hit it, now it was in an accident; I got to get a bumper, a new dash, steering wheel.

DOCTOR D958
Okay.

PATIENT D958
Uh the grill in front.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
A fender and a hood.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
And all that, plus its gotta be painted and the guy I took it to talking about $3000 I said yeah could you do it for what the insurance company paid me and then he laughed at me, no.  I, oh,  well.

DOCTOR D958
Alright how low does your blood pressure get at home?

PATIENT D958
Uh I'd say it gets around 180, around 180, 185, something like that.  That's kind of low.

DOCTOR D958
Okay.

PATIENT D958
But when it gets really low, I don't know what it is, I just don't feel like moving at all.  I just sit there and fall asleep you know.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
But that doesn't bother me falling asleep because I only get like three or four hours of sleep at night.  I got.

DOCTOR D958
Alright so let's talk about your blood pressure again.

PATIENT D958
Bad sleep problem.

DOCTOR D958
What do you take for your blood pressure?  Do you take anything?

PATIENT D958
Yeah, I listen to music.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
It soothes me really good and uh.

DOCTOR D958
This is a really high blood pressure, I'm definitely not comfortable with it I'll tell you that.

PATIENT D958
I'll keep it.

DOCTOR D958
You're not interested in treating it?

PATIENT D958
No I don't want it.  I don't want anything to lower it anymore.

DOCTOR D958
Okay.

PATIENT D958
It's kind of low.

DOCTOR D958
So just so you know the normal numbers are 120, 130s okay, these are normal.  

PATIENT D958
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D958

DOCTOR D958

PATIENT D958

DOCTOR D958

PATIENT D958

PATIENT D958
When I get a headache.

DOCTOR D958

PATIENT D958
I just, rub my temporal lobes here on both sides.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
And I hum and it goes away, blood pressure goes down, the head don't hurt.

DOCTOR D958
What causes your blood pressure to be that high, what's going on?

PATIENT D958
It's something that, whenever something strikes me and pisses me off real bad.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
Then my blood pressure goes high.

DOCTOR D958
What pisses you off that bad?

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
So I went to extremes and I soaked them in CLR.

DOCTOR D958

PATIENT D958

PATIENT D958
It's a muriatic acid.

Okay, absolutely and I don't want you to fracture your hip also okay but this is where I am you know.  I don't mind seeing you in the clinic um whenever you want to come in that's fine but the kind of blood pressure you have that makes me nervous.

PATIENT D958
My insides are not like most people.  They don't act the same as most people.  I don't act, I don't react to drugs the way most people do.

DOCTOR D958
I understand that.

PATIENT D958
A lot of pain killers that they give me in the hospital do not work uh when they find one that does work they tell me oh no we can't give you that one no more.  Now the only one that worked when I was in the hospital before was Demerol.  Nothing else they give me uh the codeine uh Tylenol with codeine and everything.  That was like eating an M & M.

DOCTOR D958
Hmm.

PATIENT D958
It done the same thing to me as an M & M.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.  I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about your blood pressure.

DOCTOR D958
Blood pressure.

PATIENT D958
Blood pressure.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
Uh swellness.

DOCTOR D958
Swellness?

PATIENT D958
Yeah.

DOCTOR D958
What's that?

PATIENT D958
You know swelling.  My legs are swelled.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
You see that.  Usually I can see the bone here real sharp and on my feet I could see the veins and stuff when I'm not swelling up and the leg is a lot skinnier here but I know that I'm swelling.  I can feel it in my feet.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
You know the feet feel swollen.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
Uh so I know I got swellness in my legs.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
Probably all the way up to the hip I don't know.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
But um when I get that like this.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
I sent to this company, it's called Travita.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
They have a thing that they get from cactus plants called Nopala.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
I get four quarts of that and I drink 3 ounces a day every day until it's all gone.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
And the swellness goes away.

DOCTOR D958
Hmm.  What about, do you see a naturopath?  There are natural doctors that.

PATIENT D958
A what?

DOCTOR D958
A naturopath.  They're called naturopaths; they're doctors who do natural medications.

PATIENT D958
That's what I like natural medications.

DOCTOR D958
We don't have them in this hospital.

PATIENT D958
You don't have them in this hospital.

DOCTOR D958
Yeah but you know they exist and you could look them up and see them so they can kind of help you with your medications and everything.

PATIENT D958
Uh yeah I could.  Do you have uh?

DOCTOR D958
I don't have any.

PATIENT D958
You don't have any huh.

DOCTOR D958
No.

PATIENT D958
Cause I mean if you had one uh I'd call them and find out or get an appointment with him or something.

DOCTOR D958
I don't have one.

PATIENT D958
Because uh I wish they had them here in the hospital you know.  There's one old doctor in here that I can't remember his name but uh.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
He is the one that I uh checked on a lot of the drugs that they were giving me already.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
And I told him what I was feeling from them and he said well they all have side effects and that and he told me about the uh the one for the cholesterol and I said well I definitely don't want a fractured hip so that one's out and I tell him I says when I get uh higher blood pressure from taking this one pill and he said that pill yeah okay and he told me about that one, then I asked him about the Plavix.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
And he said well actually all Plavix is like baby aspirin.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
He says same thing as baby aspirin but it doesn't have aspirin in it.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
No aspirin in it I said well that sounds good.  Aspirin that's not aspirin well and he says yeah and I couldn't find, everything I read didn't say nothing about Plavix being bad so I kept taking that.  Now I hear a report on it saying that it doesn't do nothing.

DOCTOR D958
The Plavix?

PATIENT D958
Yeah.

DOCTOR D958
Hmm.

PATIENT D958
That's what somebody wrote a report on so it got into the news and everything, it was on the news and I asked that same doctor about it and he says well somebody's blowing smoke he said because.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
He says well some people, he says for some people it doesn't, I don't know.  Does Plavix work the same for everybody or not?

DOCTOR D958
It should.

PATIENT D958
Uh but he said for some people it don't.  I said for me I think it works actually I think it keeps the platelets from sticking together because I don't have any more pain in my chest.  I used to get pain in my chest uh before when I didn't take the Plavix so I keep it, I been taking it ever since I had this done you know and until I can find something to take its place natural then I'll keep taking Plavix.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
But right now I haven't found anything so.  I'll keep looking in my books and different health food stores.

DOCTOR D958
Alright.

PATIENT D958
I'll find something that'll take the place of it.

DOCTOR D958
Of Plavix?

PATIENT D958
Yeah.  Alright.

DOCTOR D958
Alright.

PATIENT D958
Well you take it easy.

DOCTOR D958
You too.

PATIENT D958
And I thank you very much.

DOCTOR D958
Thank you take care.

PATIENT D958
Alright.

DOCTOR D958
See you next time; you can leave the door open.

PATIENT D958
You're a very nice doctor you listen, most of them don't.  The dudes they don't want to listen.  They think they know everything.  The guys you know, come fresh out of school, they know everything.  They don't.  Even the old doctors don't know everything.

DOCTOR D958
Nobody knows everything.

PATIENT D958
When I went in because uh my daughters called and I didn't want to go, they forced me to go in there, I went in there, this old doctor.  I don't know, had to be in his 50s, started telling me well you got to stop drinking and smoking.  I haven't smoked a cigarette since I was 25 years old.  I haven't gotten drunk since I was probably about 30.

DOCTOR D958
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D958
So I'm 70 now so because he was so serious about it in the hospital talking this shit I said to him I said okay doc I'll quit all of it.  I'll quit cold turkey right now cause I wasn't doing it in the first place.

DOCTOR D958
Yep.

PATIENT D958
That's all, so I told him the truth I quit cold turkey.  I don't smoke, I don't drink.

DOCTOR D958
Good.

PATIENT D958
Good.

DOCTOR D958
That doctor needs to talk to you again.

PATIENT D958

DOCTOR D958

PATIENT D958
