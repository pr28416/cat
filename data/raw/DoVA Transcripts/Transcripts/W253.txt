Yeah I was just free-basing.  But I was trying to get away from it so in order to get away from it I had to uh @@@.

DOCTOR W253
@@@ feet?

PATIENT W253
Doctor I told you.

DOCTOR W253
Your ankle, your shins.  Your ankle not your feet.

PATIENT W253
@@@.

DOCTOR W253
You don't have any fluid there right?

PATIENT W253
No.  

DOCTOR W253
You don't feel anything okay.

PATIENT W253
Oh @@@ total disability.  It was @@@.  But I say to myself I'll try to get away from the drugs.  Cause I'm having some problems with my back and I want to claim disability again.  @@@.

DOCTOR W253
Okay.  That has nothing to do with me.

PATIENT W253
Well, I mean can I get an examination of my back?  Can we get a look at that?  It's the lower lumbar.

DOCTOR W253
Have you had x-rays before?

PATIENT W253
On the back?

DOCTOR W253
Yes.

PATIENT W253
It might have been some time ago but I was hope.

DOCTOR W253
Yeah.  That's the problem you had.  You told me once.

PATIENT W253
I was hoping to get some type of x-rays to look at down there and compound the lower.

DOCTOR W253
I don't know if they're gonna be.  I'll take a look at it alright.  Keep your arm straight.

PATIENT W253
Alright.  Hook me up with a back doctor.  

DOCTOR W253
Better but it still sucks.

PATIENT W253
But it came down.

DOCTOR W253
160/90.

PATIENT W253
Well see that's what I told you.

DOCTOR W253
But it's gotta be 125/75.

PATIENT W253
@@@. It's because, but I told you why it's up.  I tell you why it was up.  @@@ Plus, the wife ain’t giving me sex.  @@@  Hey you my doctor.

DOCTOR W253
I know, you need to tell me @@@.

PATIENT W253
I came here and stuff.

DOCTOR W253
Oh yeah @@@.

PATIENT W253
@@@ piss me off.  I just can't take it you know.  @@@.

DOCTOR W253
You are for sure taking all those medications?

PATIENT W253
Yeah.  I take out a chess board and they sit - all my medicines are sitting right there, @@@.  I got a morning ritual that I go through, I got an evening ritual that I go through then I got one that I take at night before I go to bed.  That's the cholesterol right?

DOCTOR W253
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W253
Right.  That's the one I take, before going on to bed.  But my back doc, ooh I have to take a deep breath before I go to bend.

DOCTOR W253
It hurts?

PATIENT W253
Yeah, that's how much it hurts.  I want to try for my Social Security, see if I can retire, Social Security at 60.

DOCTOR W253
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W253
Well I got a lot of things going on with you doc okay.

DOCTOR W253
I know.

PATIENT W253
If I @@@, if I put that in, I wondered you know can we, can I get Social Security.

DOCTOR W253
@@@.  I'm not sure.

PATIENT W253
@@@.

DOCTOR W253
I don't know.  That's not something that I can help you with.  That's something that's between you and the government.

PATIENT W253
Well @@@.

DOCTOR W253
I don't think you've ever had back films here.  I don't know how that'll help you at all.

PATIENT W253
Well it'd show them that I do have problems with, because it was a permanent injury.

DOCTOR W253
@@@ because it got reversed they're likely not to give it to you anymore.

PATIENT W253
Well it's not reversed.  I took myself off of it.

DOCTOR W253
Right.  

PATIENT W253
They found @@@ something else was worse.

DOCTOR W253
Right.

PATIENT W253
So if that injury didn't go away all I got to do is see that that injury is still there.  If the injury is still there and I can show that it's still there, then that's the case.  @@@.

DOCTOR W253
Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?

PATIENT W253
I do.

DOCTOR W253
What is @@@.

PATIENT W253
I'm having problems using it.  I can't get a reading.

DOCTOR W253
So bring it in.

PATIENT W253
I've got it in the car; I keep forgetting to bring it in.

DOCTOR W253
When you come into the nurse bring it in.

PATIENT W253
I sure will.

DOCTOR W253
So you don't know what you're running at home.

PATIENT W253
No.  I'd like to cause that's why it's in the car cause I meant to bring it in for the lady to show me how to use it.  This is a new year and I need to get hold of these things.

DOCTOR W253
And the last thing I want to do is add more medication, but your blood pressure is no good and we're gonna have to add more medication.

PATIENT W253
That's only because of the situation.

DOCTOR W253
It doesn't matter why.  The thing is we need to either you need to calm down or we need to give you more medication.

PATIENT W253
Let me calm down.

DOCTOR W253
You better try cause I mean you've got to calm down a lot you know.

PATIENT W253
I can calm down a lot.  Really I can.  Things is getting better.  You know God told me to pray about it and leave it in His hands and I prayed about it and I've left it in His hands but it's just that it takes some of us a little longer than others cause you know to have that type of faith.

DOCTOR W253
How’s your weight @@@ pretty good.

PATIENT W253
Yeah cause I make sure.  Remember I tell you before she wasn't buying food around there for me to eat.  She didn't want to buy food because she didn't want me eating you know.  I told you she told me I needed to move out.  I wouldn't move out and the only way she's gonna get me out was to force me to do something where the law make me move out and she's been probing me and I won't take the bait.  We don't even sleep in the same bedroom.  I sleep in the bedroom downstairs.

DOCTOR W253
Alright.  I'll be back in a second.  You have everything squared away.  This is the one thing I'm concerned about.  I'm gonna do one of two things.  Either I'm gonna have you come back in four weeks and have it checked and if it's still high start you on another medication for this okay or it'll be better and I won't.  But I'm seriously doubting that it's gonna get better.

PATIENT W253
It's gonna be, now I don't doubt that it's gonna be better.  I'm gonna go see the old girlfriend.

DOCTOR W253
@@@ medications okay.  We've renewed what needs to be renewed.  Give us a call, you're gonna come back and see me in three months after you see the nurse in a week.

PATIENT W253
Okay.

DOCTOR W253
Okay.

PATIENT W253
Whoa, yeah I need tramadol to take.

DOCTOR W253
I ordered it, so tramadol you should get some in the mail in about a week.

PATIENT W253
Okay.

DOCTOR W253
You should have enough today.

PATIENT W253
Okay see but.

DOCTOR W253
I put in two separate orders.

PATIENT W253
Alright.  Don't, if I go down there and she tells me no we put it in the mail and that's all you getting what we put in the mail.

DOCTOR W253
You could have her page me.

PATIENT W253
Okay.  Alright uh-huh.

DOCTOR W253

PATIENT W253
Yes, yes sir.  Yes sir that sounds good.

DOCTOR W253
Just have her page me.

PATIENT W253
I will have her page you.  Matter of fact, I’ll twist her arm.

DOCTOR W253
Be nice to people.  You know when you're nice to people.

PATIENT W253
I'm always nice doc I just be saying that, you know that.

DOCTOR W253
@@@ window.

PATIENT W253
No.

DOCTOR W253
That's not what I want; someone must have changed this, crap.

PATIENT W253
I can sound intimidating doc but I'm a kitten.  I am.  I'd rather back down than to have to do anything you know physical.  I turn my cheek seven times before I bite somebody and that’s the Bible.

DOCTOR W253
Alright.  Hang tight; we'll have you out of here in five minutes.  You need to go to the Lab today and get labs okay.

PATIENT W253
Alright, I can go get labs.

DOCTOR W253
Your health maintenance type stuff okay.

PATIENT W253
Okay.

DOCTOR W253
And I might get an ultrasound of your kidney but you don't have to do that today.  They'll schedule it.

PATIENT W253
Okay.

DOCTOR W253
Perhaps we can do it at four weeks when you come for that blood pressure visit.

PATIENT W253
Yeah.

DOCTOR W253
I'll have them do it on the same day.

PATIENT W253
You gonna hook me up with a back doctor?

DOCTOR W253
Um.

PATIENT W253
You my primary doctor.

DOCTOR W253
Yes but I need to get films of your back before that.  You want me to get films of your back?

PATIENT W253
Yeah I do.  Yes I do.  Yes I do doc.

DOCTOR W253
Okay.  Sounds good.  

PATIENT W253
I'm getting ready to move out the house and I need to.

DOCTOR W253
But that, I mean, they can shoot those today if you want, it might be better if you come back on another day.

PATIENT W253
Yeah, try to let me come back.

DOCTOR W253
Okay, so anytime time next week?

PATIENT W253
Any time next week.


DOCTOR W253
Okay you can come back next week and then you could come in four weeks and do all that stuff.

PATIENT W253
@@@.  I'm with you doc.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:15  DOCTOR IN:  43:18)

DOCTOR W253
Okay.  You say you're taking all those medications, the hydrochlorothiazide, the amlodipine, how come you haven't refilled any of these?  Cause a lot of these things you haven't filled in a really long time.  But the amlodipine you filled in September.  

PATIENT W253
Which one is the amlodipine?

DOCTOR W253
Okay, @@@ if you were taking that every day, September, October, you should have been out in November and then the hydrochlorothiazide, again, that's 120 pills for 60 days.  You should have run out of all this stuff in November.

PATIENT W253
Okay.  There's at least four pills.

DOCTOR W253
I'm not gonna add another blood pressure pill.

PATIENT W253
Thank you.

DOCTOR W253
But I want you to pick up all of this crap up today.  I want you to pick up all these pills today.

PATIENT W253
What you mean all these, what pills?

DOCTOR W253
The blood pressure pills.  So that we know that you have them and that you're taking them.

PATIENT W253
This is the am, what is it the am.

DOCTOR W253
Amlodipine.

PATIENT W253
Amlodipine okay.

DOCTOR W253
I'm gonna give you the amlodipine.

PATIENT W253
Okay.

DOCTOR W253
The hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril okay.

PATIENT W253
Okay.

DOCTOR W253
Those two I'm gonna ask you to pick up today.

PATIENT W253
Today.

DOCTOR W253
And you're gonna take them religiously like you're supposed to for two weeks and you're gonna see the nurse to see what your blood pressure is then.

PATIENT W253
@@@ doc.

DOCTOR W253
Okay.

PATIENT W253
Okay.

DOCTOR W253
And then you're gonna see me in six weeks.

PATIENT W253
Six weeks, boy I'll miss you.

DOCTOR W253
Alright and then.

PATIENT W253
Yeah I'll miss you.

DOCTOR W253
In the meantime you're gonna get films of your back and I'm gonna get an ultrasound of your kidneys.

PATIENT W253
Okay.  Okay, you okay?

DOCTOR W253
Okay.  So let me make a few changes.  This you get x-rays and the ultrasound and we'll try to get it done sometimes next week.

PATIENT W253
@@@.

DOCTOR W253
Okay.

PATIENT W253
All this is gonna get better.  I got a, I got a task master in this new girlfriend and if I'm gonna leave the house, that's where I'm going, she gonna want to know all of this.  She said I'm not gonna die on her.  My wife now, she don't care.  Uh I got to go where I'm loved doc.  I do.  But the thing is doc.

DOCTOR W253
Yeah.

PATIENT W253
I be leaving, I'm not working, I'm going to go leave there where I've been 19 years and go someplace else and I'm still not working but I'm going to take up with a new lady.  I was trying to climb my way out of it through the Bible but the Bible say I can't do it.  It's a sin for me to lust after this girl because she's not my wife and the only way I can do away with my wife is to give her a divorce and I can only give her a divorce if she's unfaithful.  

DOCTOR W253
Okay.

PATIENT W253
I don't know if she's unfaithful or not.  I can, I can give false witness and just say she is but then that wouldn't be good for me.  I could be just lying.  I'd have to actually know if she's you know unfaithful in order to give her a certificate of divorce, that what the Bible said.  That's the only way I can get away from her is through adultery.  But that should be on both sides shouldn't it?

DOCTOR W253
It should.  I don't begin to understand Christianity but.

PATIENT W253
And you are?

DOCTOR W253
I’m Hindu.

PATIENT W253
Hindu?

DOCTOR W253
Yeah.

PATIENT W253
Hmm.  

DOCTOR W253
But religion is religion right?

PATIENT W253
Yeah, right.  We all believe that there's a supreme being.

DOCTOR W253
Exactly.

PATIENT W253
Hindu, isn't that an @@@?

DOCTOR W253
No.  That's @@@.

PATIENT W253
Oh voodoo.

DOCTOR W253
Yes.

PATIENT W253
Hindu @@@  I have to investigate, you know go more into it, @@@.  But we all believe in a supreme being and that this world will end.

DOCTOR W253
Okay.

PATIENT W253
And we are all be judged in the end.

DOCTOR W253
Yes.

PATIENT W253
So we're together on that.  Oh.  @@@  I can give her a certificate of divorce is she's unfaithful so I'm feeling like if I sin; if she's unfaithful then I can get a divorce.  If I'm unfaithful she can get a divorce.  Like I said, it’s @@@@ doc.  You know what I found out though in looking, I've always been um uh a late starter.  I started kindergarten a whole year.

DOCTOR W253
Late.

PATIENT W253
Late right so I've always been -  things, things have always been late to me so this just might be what this is.  I look at horoscopes and I don't really go along with it, but I will read it and it says that the universe is trying to tell me something.  And I look because I hadn't seen her in 30 years and I find, she find me, her daughter find me on Facebook.  Her daughter was 7 years old when we were together and she's 36 now. She says she's in love with me and please come over.  Cause you know when we were going together at that time, she got raped.

DOCTOR W253
Really.  Who got raped?

PATIENT W253
The girl that I'm talking about.

DOCTOR W253
Oh really.

PATIENT W253
Three guys raped her.  She was out at a disco one night and three guys raped her but she showed up over my house the next day and I think I'd did what any man should do, I gave her my bedroom, my bed and I took care of her until she was up and well and she was mental enough to get up and get around I took her shopping and spent about $500 on her for new clothes and took all those old clothes she had and burned them and her and her daughter lived with me for a while until she got on her feet and I felt that any righteous man was supposed to do that.

DOCTOR W253
Good for you.

PATIENT W253
It was a mother and a daughter that needed help.

DOCTOR W253
Alright buddy.

PATIENT W253
Alright doc.

DOCTOR W253
Okay.

PATIENT W253
Yeah until I get downstairs.

DOCTOR W253
Yeah.

PATIENT W253
Oh I got to get the labs today?

DOCTOR W253
Yeah.

PATIENT W253
4 o'clock?

DOCTOR W253
You can get all the labs while you're here but @@@.  Okay.  Now get the labs, then go pick up the meds, they should be ready for you.

PATIENT W253
I'll check in on the meds then go to the other things.

DOCTOR W253
You want them to do them right here?

PATIENT W253
Here, @@@ vampire.  yeah I do that.

DOCTOR W253
Yeah.  We need urine from you.  You gonna do all that up here?

PATIENT W253
Uh it depends.  What type of urine.

DOCTOR W253
It might be better if you go downstairs.  You see I ordered a bunch of stuff downstairs.

PATIENT W253
Oh okay, let me go downstairs.

DOCTOR W253
Go downstairs.

PATIENT W253
Cause I got to make a stop and travel.  Oh the last time I went to travel uh they did have, they ran out of money.  Alright doc.

DOCTOR W253
See you later PATIENT.

PATIENT W253
Yes sir.

Patient leaves 52:14.
