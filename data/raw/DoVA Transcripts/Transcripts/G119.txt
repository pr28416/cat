Someday I got to go through this.

DOCTOR G119
You are due either way for the sigmoid or the colon.  If you do a colonoscopy and its fine then you're clear for 10 years.  With the sigmoid if you do that one, it's shorter but if it’s fine you still have to do it in five years.

PATIENT G119
Five years doesn’t sound bad.

DOCTOR G119
Instead of 10 years?

PATIENT G119
When am I gonna be scheduled to do it?

DOCTOR G119
And you know I'll put in a consult and they'll let you know.  It’s not like it’s going to happen tomorrow.

DOCTOR G119
It looks like I don't see you're running low for your medication though so, why was your blood pressure high?

PATIENT G119
I don't know.  I'll be honest, I won't lie, I been taking my medicine, the blood pressure probably every other night.

DOCTOR G119
Why?

PATIENT G119
Because some nights I just forget.

DOCTOR G119
You forget?

PATIENT G119
Yeah and I like taking it at night rather than getting up and taking it in the morning, you know since I @@@ well I got to take my medicines at night and then you fall asleep and don't take it.

DOCTOR G119
But like this one, do you take the one for your stomach in the morning?

PATIENT G119
For my stomach, let's see.  I have so many pills.

DOCTOR G119
The omeprazole the one for your reflux.

PATIENT G119
Is that a little white pill?

DOCTOR G119
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G119
I take it at night.

DOCTOR G119
What are you doing taking it at night cause you're not eating it isn't doing any good?  It works better to take them during the day.

PATIENT G119
I could switch it around and take them all in the day.  I want to be able to take them all at the same time.

DOCTOR G119
Um let's see.  I guess the only one, I mean you just want to make sure you don't forget and your blood pressure right now, I don't know if it's because you're not taking it or if it's not working.

PATIENT G119
No it's working cause the last.

DOCTOR G119
The last one was a good one.

PATIENT G119
Right, the last time I been here they said it was super good.

DOCTOR G119
That it was good.

PATIENT G119
Right.

DOCTOR G119
Okay.

PATIENT G119
It's working, it's just I got to get back on my, get on my horse and my schedule to take it.

DOCTOR G119
Okay.

PATIENT G119
I need some more of that heartburn medicine.

DOCTOR G119
Uh-huh I'll give you all of them.

PATIENT G119
Mail them cause I need to get to the cashier before 4 o'clock.

DOCTOR G119
Do you need insulin too?

PATIENT G119
Uh.

DOCTOR G119
Do you need everything refilled?

PATIENT G119
I remember about them telling me about the insulin that I was warned that it could pull, I been taking it and it would be too much for me.  

DOCTOR G119
What do you mean?

PATIENT G119
In other words insulin brings down your blood sugar correct?

DOCTOR G119
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G119
Okay.  You were concerned if I would be taking the insulin bringing it down too low.

DOCTOR G119
Um well the last time we did the hemoglobin test it was really good to the point where maybe it’s too good.

PATIENT G119
It's too good?  Alright I cut back on the insulin like every other day.

DOCTOR G119
What are you using right now?

PATIENT G119
30 units Humulin N.

DOCTOR G119
Oh and how long were you doing this?

PATIENT G119
If I go back to shooting myself every day you better order me another bottle because I went back to taking it every other day.

DOCTOR G119
So what are you doing right now?

PATIENT G119
Every other day.  I'm going to go back to taking it.

DOCTOR G119
Once a day?

PATIENT G119
Yeah.

DOCTOR G119
And that's it?

PATIENT G119
Right, that's what I'm going to go back to taking it once a day instead of every other day.

DOCTOR G119
How about this, give me your phone number, we'll check today to see what your sugar has been in the last three months.  If it's a lot worse then we'll go back to every day okay.  So keep doing what you're doing now.

PATIENT G119
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G119
And then I'll call you and let you know what to do.

PATIENT G119
Okay you have my phone number don't you?

DOCTOR G119
Is it the same one?

PATIENT G119
Yeah it hasn't changed.

DOCTOR G119
Uh NUMBER.

PATIENT G119
No.

DOCTOR G119
NUMBER.

PATIENT G119
That's it, that's it.

DOCTOR G119
So fill this one and this one.  If you give yourself insulin though you really need to check your sugars every other day.  You can’t just give yourself insulin without making sure.

PATIENT G119
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR G119
Cause what if it's low.

PATIENT G119
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR G119
You could go into a coma.

PATIENT G119
Yeah but you know when it goes low you, I mean you'll know it.  You know you'll feel weak, tired.

DOCTOR G119
Yeah but.

PATIENT G119
For you I will take it every other day.

DOCTOR G119
Are you going to pick them up?

PATIENT G119
No mail everything.  I got to get to the cashier before 4 o'clock so I have child expenses to pay back home.

DOCTOR G119
Okay.

PATIENT G119
Cause they don't stay open when you got 3 o'clock appointments, they close at 4 sharp.  Is it normal for me to be tired when I wake up in the morning cause by 11 o'clock then I'm ready to go?  You know I have energy.

DOCTOR G119
Are you sleeping okay?

PATIENT G119
Uh I usually have to get up twice during the night to go to the washroom.

DOCTOR G119

PATIENT G119
I had been taking them but last night when I ran out I stopped taking them.

DOCTOR G119
Okay.  

PATIENT G119
That's for the heart.  I never thought I had any heart problems.

DOCTOR G119
And you’re diabetic so it's kind of like having heart problems even though you don't.

PATIENT G119
Oh right, I'll go back to taking the aspirin.

DOCTOR G119
Do you want to get it here; do you want me to order it?

PATIENT G119
