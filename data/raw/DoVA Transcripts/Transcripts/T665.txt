DOCTOR T665
The lisinopril you need too.

PATIENT T665
The what?

DOCTOR T665
The lisinopril for your blood pressure.

PATIENT T665
Oh right yeah.

DOCTOR T665
Um I was actually thinking we might want to increase that today because your blood pressures have been high.

PATIENT T665
Yeah and there too, I got a notation of my blood pressures.

DOCTOR T665
Oh good what have you got here.

PATIENT T665
Uh @@@.  

DOCTOR T665
Yeah so it's just, it's running a little on the high side.  Not bad but you know 140s, 150s, I'm seeing a lot of those.  So I think we could go up on the lisinopril cause I think you need to uh.

PATIENT T665
Okay and uh you know I don't feel no pain or nothing but for the last about couple two or three weeks it feels like a little blood around my @@@.

DOCTOR T665
@@@.

PATIENT T665
Uh-huh I told the lady about it that was taking my blood pressure a while ago.

DOCTOR T665
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T665
And she said tell the doctor.

DOCTOR T665
Yeah, definitely.  But it feels like, does it feel like it's going fast or?

PATIENT T665
Uh it feels like, just like when I take a belch it uh, then it feels better you know.  There's no pain just a lot of @@@ right here.

DOCTOR T665
Okay.  Can you feel it beating?  Does it feel like it beats faster or does it skip beats or?

PATIENT T665
It now that seems like a little thing and then sometimes it will skip a lot of beats though.

DOCTOR T665
It feels like you skip a beat okay.  @@@Let me just feel your pulse @@@  When does it usually happen?

PATIENT T665
Oh it just, it mostly uh when I do a little extra work uh moving around you know.

DOCTOR T665
When you're moving around.

PATIENT T665
I feel it.

DOCTOR T665
Do you exercise?

PATIENT T665
No, no.

DOCTOR T665
Do you go up stairs much?

PATIENT T665
Uh-huh I got stairs.

DOCTOR T665
Do you get it more when you go up the stairs?  @@@?

PATIENT T665
Just when I get a little tired, doing a little extra work or something.

DOCTOR T665
Doing a little extra work okay.  

PATIENT T665
There's no pain just it feels like it's just a flutter.

DOCTOR T665
Fluttering.

PATIENT T665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T665
Right.

PATIENT T665
And when I think that like I belch or something like that uh and then it feels like it goes away.

DOCTOR T665
Better when you belch okay.  It feels regular now but you don't feel it right now right?  

PATIENT T665
No.

DOCTOR T665
You're not feeling it right now the flutters?

PATIENT T665
No, no.  Off and on.

DOCTOR T665
Off and on.  How many times do you get it?  The fluttering?

PATIENT T665
Oh practically uh every day.

DOCTOR T665
About every day.

PATIENT T665
Yeah off and on.  And sometimes I was wondering if wasn't gas around my heart, or something.

DOCTOR T665
Well I mean it's getting better with belching it sounds like it could be gas but the fluttering and feeling like it might skip a beat.

PATIENT T665
Hmm.

DOCTOR T665
That's probably more your heart and it's not uncommon actually to have skipped beats.

PATIENT T665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T665
I get them sometimes too.  I can feel it.  Um if you get it, it's a normal thing.  It's not a big deal.

PATIENT T665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T665
Um but when it happens more often or you start to feel short of breath.

PATIENT T665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T665
Or pain or you start to have symptoms because of it then we start to worry.

PATIENT T665
Hmm.

DOCTOR T665
Um so I don't know.

PATIENT T665
There's no pain.

DOCTOR T665
No pain at all.

PATIENT T665
No pain.  Cause I have a certain alert @@@ you know before I went in the service the doctor told me I had to go to a doctor once and he said uh the Army would never take you.  Oh I said why and he says because you have a weakness of the heart and then he said well if you happen to live right he says because at your age you would outgrow it.

DOCTOR T665
Oh okay.

PATIENT T665
So like when I went into the service I took my physical to go into the service and in the service the doctor looked at what the other doctor had told me a few years ago and he said no, he said your heart is alright now.

DOCTOR T665
Yeah.  We've looked at your heart a few times and it looks okay.

PATIENT T665
Yeah.

DOCTOR T665
Actually it looks okay.

PATIENT T665
He said if you had a weakened heart we would not take you in here.  I think I have all of the questions that I had to ask you right here oh yeah.  And you think I should increase what'd you say the, what is that uh cholesterol.

DOCTOR T665
No the lisinopril it's the blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT T665
Oh for the blood pressure.

DOCTOR T665
And it helps you with depression too.

PATIENT T665
Yeah.

DOCTOR T665
It helps your heart.  It's a good medicine.

PATIENT T665
Hmm.

DOCTOR T665
Alright so what else shall I do here for you so I think we can increase that.  Do you need refills on anything else?

PATIENT T665
Oh, oh I think I actually I need refills on practically all of them but see I have some medicine but I think they all is low.  They need to be updated.

DOCTOR T665
Okay.  Are you still smoking?

PATIENT T665
No, no, I don't smoke and don't drink no more cause they told me not to drink and don't smoke.

DOCTOR T665
When did you quit smoking?

PATIENT T665
Oh 2001, that's when I was told.

DOCTOR T665
Oh great.

PATIENT T665
And then I told them I didn’t quit drinking then they asked because I was a heavy drinking and I said I wasn't gonna throw it away but I said when I finish I would stop.

DOCTOR T665
Okay.

PATIENT T665
Then I ended up stopping for maybe a couple years and then I started back for about six months and then I stopped again and that's it.

DOCTOR T665
Okay so you've stopped for good now.

PATIENT T665
I have.

DOCTOR T665
That's good.

PATIENT T665
Hung it up for good.

DOCTOR T665
Well that's great.  Okay.  And you never and you've had high blood pressure for now long?

PATIENT T665
Oh I don't know but it was during the time I was drinking they said that my blood pressure was high but I think it was because I was a heavy drinker.

DOCTOR T665
Yeah.

PATIENT T665
And uh that had something to do with it but now it, at first it would be kind of be normal like you know.

DOCTOR T665
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T665
But then all of a sudden it started going back up again.

DOCTOR T665
Okay.  So yeah.

PATIENT T665
And I know she checked it over here just a while ago and it seemed to be high.  I guess because I told her I had been drinking some coffee this morning and then she took it again and it was, it was much better.

DOCTOR T665
It was better yeah.  Still a little high.

PATIENT T665
Yeah.

DOCTOR T665
We can get it better but it's not bad.  It's actually not bad.  Have you thought about whether you want to do a colonoscopy for the colon cancer screening?

PATIENT T665
Uh.

DOCTOR T665
We talked about it last time.

PATIENT T665
Yeah for the colon uh now I don't have no problem uh you know, no pain around my rectum and I don't have no bleeding and nothing like that.

DOCTOR T665
Yeah.

PATIENT T665
So uh I'd just rather hold off on that for a while.

DOCTOR T665
You don't want to do it okay.

PATIENT T665
And what you call the other prostate I had that and it came out good.

DOCTOR T665
Yeah, yeah it looks okay alright.

PATIENT T665
So I had that.

DOCTOR T665
Have you had your flu shots?

PATIENT T665
No.  I had one shot she gave me but they didn't have the swine flu, you know what you call it, the swine.

DOCTOR T665
H1N1?

PATIENT T665
Yeah they didn't have that in at the time.

DOCTOR T665
You want to get that today?

PATIENT T665
Yeah I can take that shot.

DOCTOR T665
Okay.

PATIENT T665
@@@.

DOCTOR T665
I had to get it.  It's actually a little bit more mild than the other two shots.

PATIENT T665
Yeah.

DOCTOR T665
Depending on where you have it.

PATIENT T665
I know that they was talking about it they had to send it back in and it wasn't right or something like that.

DOCTOR T665
Oh yeah right.

PATIENT T665
But I guess they got all that straightened out.

DOCTOR T665
I think they got it straightened out.  They got it straightened out.  So you were taking medicine for your stomach for your acid reflux before called omeprazole.

PATIENT T665
Yes.

DOCTOR T665
Or Prilosec or Prevacid kind of thing.

PATIENT T665
Yeah that's what I was concerned about.  Now what was that really for?

DOCTOR T665
You were having reflux, the acid reflux symptoms.  I think that was why you were on it.  Do you tend to have it?

PATIENT T665
It was a capsule.

DOCTOR T665
Yeah.

PATIENT T665
No uh I think I was taking it because I was a heavy, used to be a heavy drinker and it what is it for, for gas or what?

DOCTOR T665
It suppresses the acid in the stomach so there's less acid in the stomach which means you get less symptoms of reflux coming up that would cause you know like burning you know belching, getting up at night, mainly burning pain at night and after meals.

PATIENT T665
Now I.

DOCTOR T665
Are you having any problems with that?

PATIENT T665
The only problem I have mostly is like a try to clear my throat like that.

DOCTOR T665
Okay.

PATIENT T665
And.

DOCTOR T665
But at night do you get burning sensation or a taste in the back of your mouth?

PATIENT T665
No.

DOCTOR T665
Okay so you probably don't need it anymore.

PATIENT T665
Yeah that's the only thing.  I thought it was for; for like to clear my throat like at sometime I had the and uh do that.

DOCTOR T665
Hmm.

PATIENT T665
But otherwise if it was for acid or something coming up I mean.

DOCTOR T665
You don't need that okay.  

PATIENT T665
But I still have some, @@@.  You know I taste them.

DOCTOR T665
But you can take it you want to if you feel that.

PATIENT T665
Uh it'd be up to it's just really up to me.

DOCTOR T665
Yeah you can choose.

PATIENT T665
Oh okay.

DOCTOR T665
I mean if you start to get that burning, acid reflux.

PATIENT T665
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T665
Feeling like after you eat a meal you just.

PATIENT T665
The gas.

DOCTOR T665
Gas.  Pain you can take then.

PATIENT T665

DOCTOR T665

DOCTOR T665
