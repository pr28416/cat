DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
I called out there, several times.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Because I figured that's what, see this numbness is still in my finger, both of them.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And uh I can live with that.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
But you know when it come to my prostate and the sleep apnea now that's something to be really concerned about.

DOCTOR M641
Okay what about the sleep apnea concerns you so much, tell me?

PATIENT M641
Because I uh, this new concern developing here now I wake up and I'll be coughing.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know not gasping for air.  I'm not short; you know I don't feel like I'm short of breath.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
But I spits up and stuff.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Now I'm laying awake.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know.

DOCTOR M641
Are you wearing the mask?

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
I just got a new one.  I get one every three months.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And uh but I'm having a problem.  Here is my problem with that mask, trying to make those adjustments with the straps.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Because I can't feel them.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
See, I can't feel it, you know some of them go like this and you put.  The one I got just come across here.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
I mean well except this one comes across like that.

DOCTOR M641
Is that one of the small ones.

PATIENT M641
Yeah the small one.

DOCTOR M641
Is that the one you're using?

PATIENT M641
And I had a full face one.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
When I first started.

DOCTOR M641
Oh okay.

PATIENT M641
But look like the rubber uh began to get soft.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know it wasn't fitting properly.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And by me with this numbness I can't make that adjustment with those straps.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
So I figured they might be coming out with something new.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
I got the newer type I think.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Right now.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
But uh that's very important with that @@@, because my oxygen you know I don't get it.

DOCTOR M641
Right.

PATIENT M641
I'm getting it but.

DOCTOR M641
Right.  No it's great you're using it because if you have sleep apnea you have to use the mask.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
Whether it's the nose mask or the face mask, you know this is fine, it works.

PATIENT M641
I sleep in it every night.

DOCTOR M641
It works very well.  Yeah uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
I put it on every night.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
Because I had a lot of my friends, associates, they swear by that.  I don't want to get like that.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Which it may require their life to change.

DOCTOR M641
So you have to give it some time okay.  Give it some time of consistent use and it gets better.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
People say that once they start using it.

PATIENT M641
They don't want to stop.

DOCTOR M641
They don't want to stop.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
But it takes some time to get used to sleeping like that.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
See I get that feedback from those guys and that's where I want to be.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.  You will be, just give it some time cause it takes some time to make sure we have the right adjustment.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
You know for the mask and for you to get comfortable with it.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
Uh what other concerns do you have besides the sleep apnea, regarding sleep apnea?

PATIENT M641
Well uh it was that my prostate like I said and I haven't had a complete physical.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Since my other doctor left.

DOCTOR M641
Okay what do you mean, what do you mean?

PATIENT M641
You know they check you for sugar and uh all that.

DOCTOR M641
For blood work yeah.  We had ordered some blood work.

PATIENT M641
I ain't had none of that I.

DOCTOR M641
No.

PATIENT M641
I ain't had nothing like that and that's what you know uh, I don't think the prostate test maybe twice a year or something maybe or once.

DOCTOR M641
Okay so in February we had ordered some blood tests the routine physical tests.  You know things that we check every year; you know cholesterol and prostate number and things like that um.

PATIENT M641
But I never got the results.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah well I don't think it was drawn cause it's still pending it says so maybe today after this appointment.  Have you eaten anything this morning?

PATIENT M641
Not yet.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.  So you can just go to the Lab and get all these blood tests done.

PATIENT M641
Please I be glad to get that.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah absolutely.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.  You think they could check me for sugar?

DOCTOR M641
Yeah uh-huh.  We'll check the sugar test with it.

PATIENT M641
Okay.

DOCTOR M641
And then your prostate number I think it was checked in December, this past December and it looked pretty good.  Are you having any problems with urination?

PATIENT M641
No other than I'm getting up.  I'm going about three times a night now.  I used to go two.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Uh but I drink a lot of water anyway.

DOCTOR M641
Do you drink water before going to bed?

PATIENT M641
Yes and I think that could be you know the reason.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
And I have uh, my bladder empties I mean cause the flow is strong.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know and uh.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know and but the only problem I got though doctor here is that sleep.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
And I think a lot of that brings on, the not sleeping, good sleep, brings on other problems.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Cause I have a tremendous appetite.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And I eat the proper foods and I eat a lot of fruit, oranges and apples.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know.

DOCTOR M641
And how's constipation?

PATIENT M641
Huh?

DOCTOR M641
Constipation, how is that?  Are you moving your bowels?

PATIENT M641
Well I'm going.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know I take that tablet that you give me uh, that little brown round one.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
I take that sometimes.  But if I miss a day or two without going I'm not too worried about it.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
But I will pop that tablet.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And uh my constipation really it bother me cause I'm not going like I was when I was younger.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
But I'm not doing anything to hurt my heart you know.

DOCTOR M641
Oh no you're not.  You're doing everything right.  The only couple of things I need you to do is follow up with the neurosurgeon.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
Because you have pretty bad arthritis in your neck.

PATIENT M641
Yeah I do.

DOCTOR M641
Impinging on some of the nerves okay.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
I don't know if the shaking is because of that.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
So it seems that Neurology had seen you and they wanted you to go see the neurosurgeons and just talk to them.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
It doesn't mean you're committed to surgery.  You talk to them and find out what they have to offer.

PATIENT M641
That's what I will do.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.  So that's at the Hines VA okay.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
The other thing um and you need to go back and see the neurologist.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
Not the urologist, not the prostate doctors, the neurologist.  He is the doctor that actually initially referred you to Hines okay.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
But this time we need to talk to them about the balance and also the shaking and see if they have anything else to offer okay.

PATIENT M641
Okay.

DOCTOR M641
Um we'll check some of the lab work um and let me talk to DOCTOR and see what we can do about sleeping.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
If there's anything else okay.

PATIENT M641
Yeah well she knows me, but I'm saying cause she and I talk and uh I'm just concerned.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
DOCTOR you know about me, you know I know I'm getting old but I'll do what I have to do.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
And I know some things you just got to live with it. 

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
Probably like abusing your body.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know at my age what am I gonna do about it.

DOCTOR M641
No, no, you take very good care of yourself so that's good.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
Um let's see some of the ways we can help you.  So I want you to know I hear your concerns.  I understand if you're not sleeping well then other things affect it.

PATIENT M641
Yeah that really bother me that sleep.  And those tablets that I have those supposed to make me rest a little better?

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
But I ain't got no more.

DOCTOR M641
When you had them were you taking them?

PATIENT M641
Well um not consistently uh.  She didn't, when they give them to me it was something just to aid, it wasn't nothing I don't think, they didn't tell me to continuously take them.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
But I know I'm out of them and uh it wasn't a harsh type of a tablet that would put you into a deep sleep or nothing like that.

DOCTOR M641
Uh uh.

PATIENT M641
And uh and I but I just want, if I could just go to you know get yawn, you know.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And I feel the sleep coming on.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
That's when I say my prayers cause I know when I get through saying my prayers I should be.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know ready cause I love to sleep.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
I really do.  I put all those years in the steel mill but that's all I did.  I worked, come home, ate, went to bed you know something like that but it was a pattern and everything was normal then.  You know you ate a good breakfast, you went to work, you stayed eight hours and come home uh did some stuff you know and then you eat your supper.

DOCTOR M641
When did you stop working?

PATIENT M641
Uh I been retired now about three years.

DOCTOR M641
Three okay.

PATIENT M641
But I put 30 years in the steel mill.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know and then uh I worked awfully hard.  I been working 50 years.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.  Long time huh.

PATIENT M641
Yeah 50 years I been, you know I worked.

DOCTOR M641
Now um when did the sleep problem start for you the first time?

PATIENT M641
The sleep problem started actually a couple years ago doc.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Really but it didn't bother me then because I just thought I had a couple of cools too much or something and uh and I'd fallen asleep and then I got you know drink beers sometimes on Friday evening.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Then uh I'd get into bed but I'd wake right up.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
So.

DOCTOR M641
How much do you drink now?

PATIENT M641
Well uh, see like I not today like I said like Fridays, you go to a retirement party or something; I drink three cans of beer.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And then a shot or two of champagne.  Not regularly, I mean this ain't nothing you know.  I'm not a regular drinker now.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know and usually when I drink beer is with a corn beef sandwich.

DOCTOR M641
So on average how much do you drink every day?

PATIENT M641
Nothing.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
Water is more, that's what I drink.  See I donâ€™t have to have a taste for it.  You have to have a taste for certain things.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
I don't have a taste, but like a person that smoke they have a taste for that cigarette, but I ain't got the taste for that alcohol.  I never drank no Jack Daniels or stuff like that.

DOCTOR M641
So when you drink, maybe you drink once or twice a week, something like that?

PATIENT M641
I'm gonna say three.

DOCTOR M641
Three times a week.

PATIENT M641
I'll say that, but that's not.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
And about three cans of beer on each.

DOCTOR M641
Each time.

PATIENT M641
Yeah because I'm gonna to a funeral this Thursday.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And at the repast they gonna have some beers.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
After the meal you know.  But I have to have that; I have to develop that taste.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
@@@ you know, so I'm not considered a drinker, but if I do I know just I'd better go with it.

DOCTOR M641
How about smoking, do you smoke?

PATIENT M641
Never smoked.

DOCTOR M641
No okay and any drug use?

PATIENT M641
Huh?

DOCTOR M641
Any drug use?

PATIENT M641
No.  I have smoked some weed.

DOCTOR M641
In the past or?

PATIENT M641
Uh about a year, about half a year, something like that.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
You know uh at a retirement party, uh but all of us guys are in our 70s, 60s. W@@ but you know it doesn't bother me none, I don't guess.  Now I worry about this kicker, but that was just the weed so, that was it.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.  And so just the one time you tried it.

PATIENT M641
Oh no it's more than that but I'd say once a month.

DOCTOR M641
Okay and you're still smoking once a month?

PATIENT M641
Yeah not regularly but I mean it'll balance out in a year's time.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
Maybe once a month.

DOCTOR M641
Okay so occasionally.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT M641
And it ain't nothing I can't quit.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
Cause if you tell me @@@ I'd say that's it.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
You see it's like that.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
With me, nothing I can do I can't stop because I'm concerned about my health.

DOCTOR M641
Let me ask you this, what's keeping you from stopping?

PATIENT M641
Huh?

DOCTOR M641
What's keeping you from stopping?

PATIENT M641
Nothing.

DOCTOR M641
Nothing, okay.

PATIENT M641
Uh uh, nothing.

DOCTOR M641
I just you know marijuana is illegal.  I'm sure if it helps you a whole lot.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
Um so you might as well stop right?

PATIENT M641
I can stop right now.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
Ain't no big deal.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
Iâ€™m serious, it ain't that I got to have it.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.  So I think.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
You smoke it once in a while like that.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
Okay hmm.

PATIENT M641
It's that heavy stuff, crack and all that is what.  I don't even go on that one but I'm just saying and you know I haven't done that since the Army.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
And uh occasionally you know when I was young and stuff but I never seamed and then you hear rumors that you know you smoke a little pot and it'll help your eyesight and this and that and got me wearing glasses so you know.

DOCTOR M641
It helps, you know in California it's legalized.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
For glaucoma.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
But I didn't see over here that you have documented glaucoma.

PATIENT M641
No.

DOCTOR M641
It doesn't help vision as such.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
But if somebody has glaucoma then it can help the glaucoma.

PATIENT M641
But uh I don't have to have it.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And I don't look for it.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Or nothing like that uh and that's not a whole joint.  I'm talking about maybe three or four people.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.  Okay, alright.

PATIENT M641
You know.

DOCTOR M641
Now let me ask you about your heart a little bit more.  When you walk around, let say if you walk a flight of stairs or walk a couple blocks do you feel any pain?

PATIENT M641
Uh uh.

DOCTOR M641
No okay.

PATIENT M641
See when I work out in my gym on the treadmill.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And stuff you know I don't feel tired, sometimes I work up a sweat but I gauge myself.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And the personal trainer she's right there.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.  And you don't feel any heart, chest pain.

PATIENT M641
Palpitating no.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.  Pain?

PATIENT M641
No.

DOCTOR M641
Pressure in your chest?  No.

PATIENT M641
No.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.  Any um, I know you sweat because you're working out.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
But what about just going up a flight of stairs and something do you feel like.

PATIENT M641
No sweat.  No sweating or nothing.  The only thing right now about me going up my steps now and coming down them I hurt in my legs.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know right in here.  You know I got varicose veins true enough uh if I'm carrying something I do feel kind of weak in the legs I go you know but this wasn't nothing compared to this.  Sometimes you know my sleep apnea but um my balance, like I say when I talked to him or whatever I was gonna discuss that with him.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
But uh that's about it.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
You know uh I don't have no problem eating uh something like I don't have to have coffee.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Uh but I will drink a cup of tea or something uh.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Every now and then. In my class they told me don't drink nothing with caffeine after six.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Stuff like that, I follow the rules.

DOCTOR M641
You follow everything okay, excellent.  

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
So that's all of your concerns okay.  So like I said see I have to talk to DOCTOR and see what other ideas we can come up with.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
So maybe you should try that medication again, the trazodone, to see if that might help you.  You have to take it before you go to bed.

PATIENT M641
Yeah and you want me to take that every night?

DOCTOR M641
Yeah uh-huh.  Let me talk to DOCTOR.

PATIENT M641
Yeah, you just tell her, well she's honest with me and all that.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah, sure, absolutely, absolutely.

PATIENT M641
I know she's concerned.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
About me and my health but I think if I could sleep.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
I'd be a much better person if I could sleep.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
We're gonna try to help you with sleep okay.

PATIENT M641
Okay.

DOCTOR M641
And your sleep apnea, you're using the machine.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
Give it some time and you'll get used to it okay.

PATIENT M641
Okay.

DOCTOR M641
And then we'll see how things go.

PATIENT M641
Okay.  Now.

DOCTOR M641
Uh.

PATIENT M641
Can I bring, I can bring that, now cause see I want to make, no one ever fitted that mask on me.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Now the matter with me I can't grasp those straps.  This new mask they give me.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Well she adjusted it up there but I puts it on intact.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And pull it down.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know and then it rests right here.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
So I can do it like that.

DOCTOR M641
Can somebody help you with the mask?

PATIENT M641
Yeah my wife, when she's there.

DOCTOR M641
If it's hard to put it on.

PATIENT M641
It's hard by myself.

DOCTOR M641
Then you can put it on like this and strap it around.

PATIENT M641
See if I put, leave that one strap open.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And then you know.

DOCTOR M641
Just put it on.

PATIENT M641
Yeah and then use that one strap.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Kind of like this new type I got there's two straps.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
For this one.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know.

DOCTOR M641
Now do you go to the Equipment Clinic?

PATIENT M641
No that's where I got it from here.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
But nobody showed, she showed me this last time the one that I got but when I went to the class I spent the night out here for observation and they found out that I stopped breathing a couple of times and all that good stuff so after I went to pick up the equipment no one showed me how to put that thing on.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
The mask.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
And the lady who did I didn't understand her English.  She didn't, I couldn't understand what she was saying.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
So I was just stuck with something.

DOCTOR M641
Where was that lady?  Was she in the clinic?

PATIENT M641
She was in the, she was issuing the equipment.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.  So maybe we need to go back with them.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
Uh cause they're the ones who would do the adjustment for you.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
Okay so why don't you bring your mask back, go back to them and maybe speak with someone else.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
Not that person.

PATIENT M641
Because see I, just like this behind me.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
The head, you see mine comes across the forehead.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Too.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
But my hose connect and that is the one that comes across the forehead.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And I love that one.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
You know but I'm getting it balled up behind the head back here.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And I think it's the thing just behind the head.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Now thatâ€™s a good fit if I could get mine to do that.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
You know.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah, yeah, no they can help you.  That's just the adjustment that needs to happen okay.

PATIENT M641
Yeah but sometimes.

DOCTOR M641
Just give it a little bit of time to come up with the mask that's appropriate for you.

PATIENT M641
Cause sometimes in the night you know you toss and turn and that hose and the straps twist and it's a mess.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh, yeah it's uncomfortable.

PATIENT M641
But the other than that, I think I'm getting a good enough fit during the night.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
Because I could see the water in my machine is leaving.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
And my little calendar that's a data sheet I check it.  I got to find out when I was supposed to bring it back here in three months.

DOCTOR M641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M641
So they can tell if it's effective or something like that.

DOCTOR M641
Find out yeah.

PATIENT M641
So I'm gonna do that uh when I come back.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.

PATIENT M641
On one of those thingse here.

DOCTOR M641
So we'll work on getting that mask fitted to you appropriately and I think that'll help you sleep also.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.  As far as your prostate is concerned, you know your prostate number was checked recently, within the year and it looked okay.  You didn't tell me very significant urinary complaints but we can have you see the urologist again.

PATIENT M641
Yeah.

DOCTOR M641
Do you want to doctors?

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
And then we'll take it from there.  What we'll do today is check your urine.  Okay one more time just make sure there's no blood in it.

PATIENT M641
Okay, uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
And then you talked about your heart.  You know the symptoms you're telling me it seems like you have a good heart that's working pretty good okay.  Um maybe it is related to not sleeping very well with the sleep apnea symptoms okay.  Right now I'm gonna keep an eye on that.

PATIENT M641
Okay.

DOCTOR M641
Okay.  Um and then we talked about constipation.  Constipation you're gonna continue using the tablet that you're taking.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M641
The Docusate, continue eating all the foods that you are eating cause all that helps keep your stools soft and you know so you can move your bowel.

PATIENT M641
Uh-huh.  I do eat a lot of yogurt too.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah uh-huh.  Alright.  Is that everything?

PATIENT M641
That's about it uh you know because I'm gonna get these tests you see, the blood work that'll tell you some stuff and I'm just concerned about my prostate but believe if I can, if I can sleep.

DOCTOR M641
Everything would be better.

PATIENT M641
Four full hours, three hours or four of good sleep I'd be a better person.

DOCTOR M641
Right.

PATIENT M641
I just be irritable and crabby in the morning when they.

DOCTOR M641
Yeah.

PATIENT M641
You know.

DOCTOR M641

PATIENT M641
Don't get the rest that you should be getting.

DOCTOR M641

PATIENT M641
Huh?

DOCTOR M641
How's your mood been?  You said when you don't rest you get irritable and crabby but other times do you feel depressed at all?

PATIENT M641
