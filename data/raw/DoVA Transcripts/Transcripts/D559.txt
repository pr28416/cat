I don't know if that's called locked jaw but there are times when I open up my mouth and its hard and I go like that and I got to rub it out.  I should have brought my medical records, all this stuff is in my records.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.  Um any trouble urinating or blood in your urine?

DOCTOR D559
Okay cause I was trying to see in your files to see if any lab has been ever done on you and the answer is no.

PATIENT D559
No you're my first doctor I've seen since I've been back.

DOCTOR D559
In October?

PATIENT D559
Yeah cause in October I didn't really see a doctor.  I saw the physician, or the person.

DOCTOR D559
The nurse practitioner?

PATIENT D559
That does my paperwork and I got a flu shot that day in October.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.

PATIENT D559
And then that's it and @@@.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.  Then we probably have to have you come back and do labs, screening blood work, including your cholesterol.

PATIENT D559
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D559
You have a history of diabetes um.  Checking your A1C just to make sure that's normal and you have a history of hypertension, probably checking your urine just to make sure things are fine and we're not seeing any protein or any blood in your urine okay.

PATIENT D559
I don’t think I’m losing protein.

DOCTOR D559
Are you trying to lose weight at all or?

PATIENT D559
No, no.

DOCTOR D559
Why is that?

PATIENT D559
I'm done losing weight.

DOCTOR D559
What have you tried?

PATIENT D559
No I'm done losing weight.  I tried military, I've tried the military and I've tried the military, I'm done trying to lose weight.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.

PATIENT D559
No more, no more Hydroxycut, no more pills.

DOCTOR D559
Do you kind of watch what you're eating or are you just going based on…?

PATIENT D559
No I'm just eating what I want, when I want, how I want, how much that I want.

DOCTOR D559
Uh-huh, okay.  It's something to keep in mind @@@.

PATIENT D559
I'm good.

DOCTOR D559
Now I'm trying to see the last time you were here; you're blood pressure was really not that bad, it was like 130/72 and today it is @@@.

PATIENT D559
That blood pressure is over and it can be like one day like I came in, in the service is a perfect example.  I came in one day to check, everybody was getting their medical check so I came in, got my blood pressure checked and it was extremely high and they're like we need to see you the next day.  I came in it was way low so they like we can't really tell with you and I'm like I know cause it's off.  I can come in one day and people are like you're gonna die and then the next day you're okay.  My blood pressure goes up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down.  Stress, non-stress, what I eat, what I don't eat, what I've done for the day, if I relax all day, @@@.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.

PATIENT D559
Forget it; you'll be like this guy is driving me nuts with the blood pressure.

DOCTOR D559
No I mean it's been high the several times that you come in.  Let's say its high today and tomorrow its fine and you come back once a month later and its high I may say we need to maybe just start you on something.  I mean that is your choice @@@.

PATIENT D559
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D559
So then we can go from there, we just have to keep an eye on it. So, you’ve tried a weight loss program or just a military work out?

PATIENT D559
Military.

DOCTOR D559
Which is fine.

PATIENT D559
No.  I had to speak to nutritionists.

DOCTOR D559
Where here?

PATIENT D559
No in the service.  They sent me to; when you are overweight they send you to a nutritionist right away.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.

PATIENT D559
And you got to sit there and listen to her, uh eat this portion with this and this and this, I'm like can you multiply that by five so I can actually have a good meal?

DOCTOR D559
Well I guess it's the portion size that.

PATIENT D559
Oh yeah, yeah.  That kind of stuff never worked for me.  Never worked, they're like okay main thing, I was like are you serious.  I live to eat, I don’t eat to live.

DOCTOR D559
How so you've been hypertensive since what age?  How long have you had the hypertension?

PATIENT D559
Hypertensive is what?

DOCTOR D559
Like high blood pressure.

PATIENT D559
High blood pressure.

DOCTOR D559
Yeah that they started you on the medicine you stopped taking?

PATIENT D559
Uh, let's see when I actually fully got checked out, I'd say maybe in '97 when I joined the Marine Corps and then I was in there for four years and I had and then I got out.

DOCTOR D559
You had it in '97?

PATIENT D559
'97 the blood pressure and they gave me meds and I stopped taking it there and I got out for five years, joined the Army, started me on the medication there and then I stopped taking it so it's like.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.  So maybe since '97, wow that's pretty young and you're 34 right?

PATIENT D559
That's because, yes 34.

DOCTOR D559
That's because what?

PATIENT D559
I was uh a very big boy when I was younger.

DOCTOR D559
How big?

PATIENT D559
Uh fat.  I went in @@@.

DOCTOR D559
You're 246 pounds now.

PATIENT D559
Yeah I was about that when I joined the Marine Corps and then within three months I came out I was 185 pounds, so in three months I lost all that weight and then a month later.

DOCTOR D559
From 250, 200?

PATIENT D559
To 180, cause I was called a fat recruit when they sprayed me with all the lines and I was on diet rations, all that crap and a month after I got out, I was back up again.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.

PATIENT D559
I cleared the systems and I was like bloop, not 250 but I was back up to like 220, 225, you know like that or back up, hey you're fat for your height.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.

PATIENT D559
So.  

DOCTOR D559
So some things worked for you in the past right.

PATIENT D559
Yeah if I went back to the Marine Corps boot camp whatever they had me doing there, the exercise and the sweating and the white rice with the skinless chicken and @@@ all the plain stuff that they made me.

DOCTOR D559
Okay and then you said your left eye is itching?

PATIENT D559
Yeah.

DOCTOR D559
What's going on?

PATIENT D559
I don't know, it just started itching.  I think it's because I had dirty hands or something and I touched my eye at work or something but it just feels funny and it's a little puffy.

DOCTOR D559
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT D559
This is day two.

DOCTOR D559
Anything coming out of it?

PATIENT D559
No.

DOCTOR D559
Has it been more red than usual?

PATIENT D559
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D559
Has your eye been pink?

PATIENT D559
I don't know if it's pink but its red, its looks a little bit red.

DOCTOR D559
Right now it's red?

PATIENT D559
Can you tell, I don't know, is there any difference or not?

DOCTOR D559
It just looks swollen.

PATIENT D559
It looks swollen okay.  I can feel it when I just move my eyeball.

DOCTOR D559
It just feels dry?

PATIENT D559
No not dry.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.  

PATIENT D559
It itches.

DOCTOR D559
What have you tried on it or did you just let it?

PATIENT D559
I let it, I went into school this morning and I asked some of the mothers that go to school with me what to do and they're like don't do nothing just go get it checked out and get antibiotics so like okay.  I like to ask the moms.  They know best.  You know like Visine, flush, the eyes and see what happened.

DOCTOR D559
Probably wouldn't help.

PATIENT D559
That's why I ask the moms.

DOCTOR D559
Have a seat up here.  Nice and clean. @@@.  Open your mouth, say ah and stick out your tongue, ah.

PATIENT D559
Ah.

DOCTOR D559
Okay good.  I want you to swallow for me.  Swallow for me again.  

PATIENT D559
Is it weird that sometimes my Adam's apple gets stuck and I got to shift it back.

DOCTOR D559
(laughter)

PATIENT D559
Into place, is that funny?

DOCTOR D559
Um.

PATIENT D559
Or does that happen @@@.

DOCTOR D559
Um I'm not really; I never had anyone mention that.

PATIENT D559
No but it's like I'll be laying down on my pillow and it like shifts and I have to pop it back into place.

DOCTOR D559
How often does it happen?

PATIENT D559
Oh it's weird, on occasion yeah.  I don't mind, it's like oh let me shift it back that kind of thing.

DOCTOR D559
Yeah, take a deep breath in for me.  Can you lay back?  I'm just going to go around your belly.  Do you want to try the Nutrition Help here?  No.

PATIENT D559
Uh uh.

DOCTOR D559
Alright go ahead and sit up.  When do you think you'll be back to get the labs done?

PATIENT D559
If you want I could be back next week Thursday.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.

PATIENT D559
That's my day off.  @@@ right after school.  I would like to, also if I could, is there a possible way and how much it would cost if I get a vasectomy done, is it possible?

DOCTOR D559
Why would you want to do that? 

PATIENT D559
Because I'm done having children.  I love my babies.

DOCTOR D559
How many kids do you have?

PATIENT D559
I have two, one girl and one boy, 8 and 6.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.

PATIENT D559
Yeah.

DOCTOR D559
I'm not sure, I'm not sure if it's at the VA.  I doubt it's a procedure where it's going to be, they would pay for it.  Have you ever looked into that to see if they would pay for it?

PATIENT D559
When I was in I wanted to do it but I kept, my supervisor, whatever sergeant, he kept saying put it off, put it off, you can't do it, we got this to do.  So I wanted to get it done when I went, I was able to get it done because I was going to talk to the doctor to get it done and get it paid for while I was in.

DOCTOR D559
Oh.

PATIENT D559
But the thing is now I'm out and I'm with the VA now, how much out of pocket or what.

DOCTOR D559
I don't know.

PATIENT D559
See that's what I need to find, I don't know who to speak to to find out all that's involved.

DOCTOR D559
I would have to check and see.

PATIENT D559
Okay.

DOCTOR D559
Okay, I'll be back.

PATIENT D559
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  47:04  DOCTOR IN:  54:42)

DOCTOR D559
Alright good news is I can get you a referral for that @@@ and you would have to, you would have to talk to the urologist and then they'll let you know.

PATIENT D559
Okay.

DOCTOR D559
@@@.  So I'm going to do a nurse recheck of your blood pressure.  We could go two ways, if it's consistently high, like obviously in the 140s then I would have to say we need to start you on the medicine okay.  I'll recheck, let me recheck the blood pressure now.  

PATIENT D559
That @@@ shouldn't even be around my gut.

DOCTOR D559
@@@.

PATIENT D559
That's what I'm going to school for and I'm like @@@.

DOCTOR D559
Oh really.

PATIENT D559
@@@.

DOCTOR D559
@@@ turned @@@ down.

PATIENT D559
Oh, you've got a way to figure it out.

DOCTOR D559
What shot did you get today.

PATIENT D559
She gave me the pneumonia.

DOCTOR D559
Pneumovax.

PATIENT D559
The Pneumovax.  

DOCTOR D559
I know it’s tight, I just have to get it higher than the number she got.  140/90.

PATIENT D559
What'd she get?

DOCTOR D559
150 something.  So both numbers are high.  So I would say overall the good news is if you do try to as far, even though I know you said you are okay with your weight, at least kind of watch what you eat.  Do you eat out a lot?

PATIENT D559
Yes every day.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.  Watching what you eat, low sodium diet, no honestly because sodium kind of ties in to high blood pressure.  So if you're eating out a lot, there's a lot more processed foods and um you're more prone to be hypertensive.  That's just the bottom line and then the other stuff would be as far as you know, I know what you know you were on medication, but at some point you were no longer on meds then if your weight does come down and you're watching what you eat you may not need the medicines.  For blood pressure, for cholesterol and the more your weight goes up the more you'll be prone to be snoring a lot at night.  Some people, I'm sure you've heard, have to use a CPAP, the mask that you use to sleep.  I mean, I'm just giving you things to think about.

PATIENT D559
Okay.

DOCTOR D559
As far as long term issue.  I'm not trying to scare you or anything.  Just give you something to think about.

PATIENT D559
Uh yeah, I get scared @@@.

DOCTOR D559
And as far as like the eye stuff, I'm not giving you any antibiotics, this could go up on it’s own and usually what people do is use like just very warm compresses, like your washcloth.

PATIENT D559
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D559
And like really warm water and you just put it over it and it should get better within a couple days.

PATIENT D559
Okay.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.  I'll go ahead and order your labs and um so you said sometime this week right?

PATIENT D559
Yes.

DOCTOR D559
It's usually better, can you come in the morning cause you should not have eaten anything cause we'll be checking your cholesterol.

PATIENT D559
Let's see Tuesday morning is the only morning I can squeeze in there or Friday morning.

DOCTOR D559
Okay.  You can come whenever you have time @@@.

PATIENT D559
Okay.

DOCTOR D559
We're checking the blood cholesterol and let me put in the referral.

PATIENT D559
Can I do a warm pack night combo something else because.

DOCTOR D559
@@@.

PATIENT D559
Because like there's nothing I could put in my eye right now just like a warm compact plus?

DOCTOR D559
Uh uh.

PATIENT D559
Something. 

DOCTOR D559
Just the warm compresses.

PATIENT D559
I'm trying to nuke this thing; I don't want it to last three days.

DOCTOR D559
Just try to make sure it doesn't get infected.  I'll put in your referral and your contact number is PHONE NUMBER?

PATIENT D559
Yes it is.

DOCTOR D559
And I think you're all set.  You should hear from me sometime next week or in two weeks to follow up with the labs and the nurse visit to get the blood pressure.  Probably the day you come and get the labs drawn to get a blood pressure check okay.

PATIENT D559
Okay.

DOCTOR D559
Anything else?

PATIENT D559
Nope.

DOCTOR D559
Um and hopefully I'll be seeing you more regularly in the meantime.

PATIENT D559
No I don't want uh, I don't like coming to the hospital regularly.

DOCTOR D559
So for now, let's see we can follow up.

PATIENT D559
Now as you can see the last time I was here was in October.

DOCTOR D559
You can follow up in about six months.

PATIENT D559
Okay.  That's fine.

DOCTOR D559
And maybe sooner it depends on what the labs show how about that?

PATIENT D559
Okay.  That's fine.

DOCTOR D559
Alright.  @@@.

PATIENT D559
The desk area?

DOCTOR D559
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D559
Okay.

DOCTOR D559
