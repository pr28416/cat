PATIENT W838
Well I'm in the, I'm in the, let's see what they call it, APT upstairs.

DOCTOR W838

DOCTOR W838
Okay how's it going?

PATIENT W838
Just fine, fine.

DOCTOR W838
Going well?

PATIENT W838
Yeah.

DOCTOR W838
And when was your last drink?

PATIENT W838
Oh um well I had a very tiny bit on a field trip during the program.

DOCTOR W838
When was that?

PATIENT W838
Uh let's see that was around the 10th I believe.

DOCTOR W838
Tell me how that happened.

PATIENT W838
Uh it was a crazy field trip.  It was what they call um uh, what do they call that thing; it was a National Guard thing.

DOCTOR W838
Okay.

PATIENT W838
Um stand down.

DOCTOR W838
Okay.

PATIENT W838
And a lot of homeless veterans show up in that and it's kind of a party atmosphere and in line I drank a bit.

DOCTOR W838
Okay.

PATIENT W838
And uh they were going to throw me out of the program.

DOCTOR W838
Yeah.

PATIENT W838
They put me in the nut ward on 7 for seven days and let me back in the program.

DOCTOR W838
Okay.  And you stopped the drinking, I mean how do you feel about the program are you committed since then?

PATIENT W838
Yeah I'm trying to, I mean I don't think the, I think the program's flawed because they had four field trips just in the first 21 days I was there.

DOCTOR W838
Okay.

PATIENT W838
In the first 21 days, four field trips – for an inpatient, to me that didn't seem like a normal inpatient program.

DOCTOR W838
I'm not sure @@@.

PATIENT W838
Okay but from what I understand most programs, at least 21 days before you can see the outside world but anyway um I am committed.

DOCTOR W838
Okay.

PATIENT W838
But I was standing in line for five hours with a bunch of homeless drunks and so on with bottles in their pockets and that's pretty tempting you know.

DOCTOR W838
I know that's tempting.

PATIENT W838
I'm not justifying it but.

DOCTOR W838
Alright.

PATIENT W838
I did it.

DOCTOR W838
You did it.

PATIENT W838
And I spent seven days on the nut ward for it.

DOCTOR W838
Okay.  Otherwise any shakes, any tremors?

PATIENT W838
Oh no, no, I had no DTs or anything.

DOCTOR W838
Any hallucinations?

PATIENT W838
No, no.  No I did my uh I did my detox before I went into the program.

PATIENT W838
It took so long to actually see the doctor cause I missed so many appointments.

DOCTOR W838

PATIENT W838
Okay.

DOCTOR W838
You haven't had it for about a year so I need you to go and get that to make sure everything is good.

PATIENT W838
Is that all you do today?

DOCTOR W838
I mean, um this is a fasting blood test, did you have lunch today?  Well we can get it some other time, at your convenience.

PATIENT W838

DOCTOR W838

DOCTOR W838

DOCTOR W838

PATIENT W838
And I don't know if it’s from the detoxing or what but it's hard, it's painful, they are deep under the skin, it's not surface.

DOCTOR W838

DOCTOR W838
Uh so we're not gonna start anything or make any changes right now.

PATIENT W838
Good.

DOCTOR W838
Um otherwise the soonest you need to come back, probably a couple months after the program's done here to check up on you to make sure.

PATIENT W838

DOCTOR W838
Yes they'll give you a call.

PATIENT W838

DOCTOR W838
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W838
Um I am able to get back to sleep.

DOCTOR W838
Okay.

PATIENT W838
But um is there any kind of a sleeping pill that would.

DOCTOR W838
If you're able to get back to sleep the sleeping pills aren't really the ones that we would use for that situation.

PATIENT W838
Oh okay, alright.  I @@@.

DOCTOR W838
Are you having like nightmares?

PATIENT W838
I don't know, I don't know.

DOCTOR W838
Bring it up to the Psychiatry people up there too since to see if there's anything special but if you're able to go back to sleep and you're able to actually fall asleep I don't recommend any further sedating medicine.

PATIENT W838
Well I.

DOCTOR W838
They also have an addictive potential.

PATIENT W838
Oh I know that.

DOCTOR W838
That's why I don't want to give you medication for that right now.

PATIENT W838
Alright.  I've had insomnia my entire life.  That's a lot of the reason why I drank so much.

DOCTOR W838
But I think once you stop drinking then we'll see how the insomnia goes.

PATIENT W838
Alright.  Uh I think that's it, alright.

DOCTOR W838
Alright sir.  @@@.

PATIENT W838
No, no.

DOCTOR W838
@@@.

PATIENT W838
Oh I have kind of heavy white nasal discharge every morning.

DOCTOR W838
That's a postnasal drip situation, @@@ laying down a lot and when you wake up @@@.

PATIENT W838
It comes out but it's ridiculously thick and it's white.

DOCTOR W838
I can give you a nasal spray @@@.

PATIENT W838
What's that?

DOCTOR W838
A nasal spray to help clear it up.

PATIENT W838
Is it something I should use?

DOCTOR W838
I don't, you can try it temporarily just to see if it helps clear it up.

PATIENT W838
Okay.

DOCTOR W838
Yeah I can put that in for you.

PATIENT W838
Okay.  And I should be able to pick up the uh Nicorette, nasal sprays.

DOCTOR W838
It should all be there.

PATIENT W838
How long do you think I should give the Pharmacy?

DOCTOR W838

PATIENT W838
Oh I should get a number first and.

DOCTOR W838
Yeah, yeah you should get a number.

PATIENT W838
Okay.

DOCTOR W838
You're good to go.

PATIENT W838
Alright cause otherwise the nurses are gonna cut me off on the Nicorette because even though I still have some in my box up there, they're gonna say I don't have a prescription so I can't have any more.

DOCTOR W838
Yep it's in there.

PATIENT W838
Alright cool.

DOCTOR W838
