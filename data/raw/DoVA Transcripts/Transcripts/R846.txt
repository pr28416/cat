PATIENT R846
Right.  The only time, every time I'm seeing them I got ulcers, they prescribe medication for it and so it should be, actually I'd say I have to get a doctor to fill me, all they got to do is look at the paperwork @@@.

DOCTOR R846

DOCTOR R846
We'll get your things and hopefully we might have some bumps in the road but hopefully we can.

PATIENT R846

DOCTOR R846
Get there, okay.

PATIENT R846
I'm pretty sure.

DOCTOR R846
Uh do you have enough supplies?  I know I renewed them all the last time.

PATIENT R846
The only thing I don't have is Bacitracin but I can get that.  I been getting stuff at Walgreen’s anyway.

DOCTOR R846
Okay and it's still draining just like what it was draining the last time huh.

PATIENT R846
Yes.

DOCTOR R846
Okay and you're taking, what medications are you taking by mouth?  Just the HIV's?

PATIENT R846
HIV, ibuprofen.

DOCTOR R846
For the pain?

PATIENT R846
Yeah, they gave me some, the doctor didn't tell me to take it but I been taking it because I have this infection on my neck.

DOCTOR R846
Who gave you that?

PATIENT R846
The doctor gave me some supplements, sulfa some kind of name or something.

DOCTOR R846
@@@?

PATIENT R846
Yeah, anyway I been taking it and they told me to stop.  I started like taking it and it almost cleared this stuff up, it's a bacteria.

DOCTOR R846
Okay.  @@@ what do you put on it?

PATIENT R846
I put calamine lotion on it, you can barely see it, if you look last month when I came to see you, it was bad.  It was a hole in my neck.

DOCTOR R846
Okay.

PATIENT R846
It was a hole there and it was almost through the skin so you could see the bone in my throat but it's closing up now and so.  It's the @@@ core infection where it feels like something is crawling beneath the skin, it's not contagious or anything.  The dermatologist is not seeing anything.

DOCTOR R846
Oh I remember this, I remember it now.

PATIENT R846
Yeah what's happening is things crawling on my skin, they like hairs but they white and they crawl through my skin and I, I have to have that and it's starting to clear up.

DOCTOR R846
I remember you were seeing a dermatologist about it.

PATIENT R846
Yes and it's clearing up.  They tried to tell me it was eczema and I don't have no eczema that radical.

DOCTOR R846
Yeah.  Have a seat up here.  I am really sorry this would happen with the medications @@@?

PATIENT R846
Oh, @@@ I just didn't know.

DOCTOR R846
No it's good for me to know because it's important just to make sure.

PATIENT R846
He done told me that my HIV is non-detectable now.

DOCTOR R846
Yeah your HIV, so you got labs done, it looks on the 14th.

PATIENT R846
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R846
Right now it's pending but we're gonna have your CD4 count, which is your cell count and hopefully and your viral loads, the virus in your blood looks really good.

PATIENT R846
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R846
So it's good you're taking your medications.  It's ideal so you're not as prone to complications with the HIV.

PATIENT R846
What I'm thinking is that if I could stay on it, my health will improve.

DOCTOR R846
Yeah.  I'm just trying to see, I can't remember where.

PATIENT R846
It's one of those things you know it's draining now.

DOCTOR R846
I remember.

PATIENT R846
It might get bigger.

DOCTOR R846
Oh right here.

PATIENT R846
It's small, it's about right here.

DOCTOR R846
Ah. @@@ remember all this?

PATIENT R846
Yeah, it's @@@.

DOCTOR R846
I don’t see. So did you just change this? Nothing’s draining.

PATIENT R846
It's draining, it's draining, it's draining but it's not big.  @@@.

DOCTOR R846
Okay.

PATIENT R846
So what I'm saying is that everything is okay, but wait until it gets cold, then what's gonna happen, my legs is, all the skin is gonna break down on my legs again.  As long as I keep this going on.

DOCTOR R846
When do you see Podiatry?

PATIENT R846
Oh in about another two weeks is when it is.

DOCTOR R846
Okay, deep breath.  Okay look up.  Alright, have a seat.  

PATIENT R846
Okay.

DOCTOR R846
Um so you have enough of your supplies.  They already sent your medications.

PATIENT R846
I did get them yeah.

DOCTOR R846
So you're good right now.

PATIENT R846
The only @@@ if I'm gonna have the medication @@@ gotta go to Walgreen’s, the reason I'm saying that is.

DOCTOR R846
I can give the bacitracin.

PATIENT R846
Yeah.

DOCTOR R846
Absolutely. Definitely.

PATIENT R846
Definitely.

DOCTOR R846
@@@.

PATIENT R846
Cause I'm trying to keep the infection down.

DOCTOR R846
That I can do.

PATIENT R846
Anyway, the office and the forms @@@Damen Building, pretty soon we'll have to have you @@@.  I don't have no @@@.  You hear what I'm saying, I'm waiting for this to stop draining before I @@@.

DOCTOR R846
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R846
Then in the meantime with this much gauze and compressed on it.

DOCTOR R846
Yeah.

PATIENT R846
It's keeping the swelling down.

DOCTOR R846
Okay.

PATIENT R846
So they wasn't complaining about me putting that on there.

DOCTOR R846
Well I'm going to refill your bacitracin.

PATIENT R846
Okay.

DOCTOR R846
There's no point @@@.

PATIENT R846
So, now what do I do when I pick the form up today?  Just drop it here?

DOCTOR R846
You can drop it off with my nurse and I'll just get it to them within the week okay.

PATIENT R846
Okay.

DOCTOR R846
Only because today for some reason other than @@@.

PATIENT R846
Oh no, I'm not even worrying about it.

DOCTOR R846
Um.

PATIENT R846
I'm just happy that I was able to have an appointment with you.

DOCTOR R846
Yeah I'm glad to see you.

PATIENT R846
Cause actually I'm trying to stick with the VA.

DOCTOR R846
Yeah.

PATIENT R846
Before I die.

DOCTOR R846
Don't say things like that.

PATIENT R846
They told me that if I made it another hour, see I was bad when I had that bad infection in my neck.

DOCTOR R846
It's scary with infections.

PATIENT R846
And so what I'm saying is the VA are the ones that saved my life because still with the Air Force, if I had gone to to a hospital with the Air Force I would've died because I wouldn't have gotten medical care in time.  If something happens I can come to the VA Hospital.

DOCTOR R846
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R846
Emergency Room and things do happen in life, know what I'm saying so that's why I did that you know.  But I need to get more of the medical insurance which I'm attempting to do now.

DOCTOR R846
Okay.

PATIENT R846
I don't know lately if the HIV, it kind of feels like @@@.

DOCTOR R846
What do you mean like?

PATIENT R846
Why my leg does that.  They say I have osteomyelitis in my legs.

DOCTOR R846
It's in the legs yeah.  That could be.

PATIENT R846
And the veins in the leg and all that.

DOCTOR R846
Um, we'll probably gonna have you get a MRI but I want the doctor, the IV doctors to see you for that okay.

PATIENT R846
Okay.

DOCTOR R846
I'll be right back @@@.

PATIENT R846
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  17:21  DOCTOR IN:  18:42)

DOCTOR R846
One more second, I'm sorry.  You have a lot of appointments coming up huh.

PATIENT R846
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R846
I set you up for a colonoscopy last time, what happened with that?

PATIENT R846
Maybe I didn't, maybe I didn't do it yet.

DOCTOR R846

DOCTOR R846
