You're not checking your sugars?

PATIENT H542
Oh no.

DOCTOR H542
Oh okay.

PATIENT H542
@@@ oh yeah.

DOCTOR H542
Alright.  Um I think it'd be a good idea to have you start.  @@ check it every other day, check your numbers.

PATIENT H542
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H542
And it looks like your diabetes is a little worse.

PATIENT H542
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H542
Um cholesterol is okay.  

PATIENT H542
And the diet, @@@ diabetic so.

DOCTOR H542
How’s your breathing been?

PATIENT H542
Well, you know I took, you signed up for the test, how'd I do?

DOCTOR H542
It looks like you have uncontrolled obstructive sleep apnea.

PATIENT H542
Good.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.

PATIENT H542
Cause they came back and said I @@@, cause that's the worst diagnosis in the world.  I got every symptom @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah.  They want to set you up with a machine to help you breathe.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
They probably want you on a CPAP.

PATIENT H542
That's @@@ oxygen.

DOCTOR H542
It doesn't, I don't think that you needed oxygen uh intermittently to provide pressure.

PATIENT H542
Yeah, yeah I @@@ that.

DOCTOR H542
CPAP.  Have you ever used it before?

PATIENT H542
No.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.

PATIENT H542
I read about it @@@.  And I went up there and talked to the gal up there and I read up on that and did some research.

DOCTOR H542
Oh it was DOCTOR @@@.  So have an appointment with DOCTOR on the 25th of this month.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
That's when they'll set you up with that.

PATIENT H542
That's weird.  A psychiatrist can set you up with a breathing machine.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.

PATIENT H542
Yeah she's my psychiatrist.

DOCTOR H542
Oh yeah she can put that in.

PATIENT H542
No she had @@@.

DOCTOR H542
@@@ I don't see if she put in for that.  Who is DOCTOR?

PATIENT H542
DOCTOR is my – she’s a social worker.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.

PATIENT H542
She’s right next door to Pulmonary.

DOCTOR H542
Alright so you're gonna need a Pulmonary follow-up appointment.

PATIENT H542
Yeah, she’s not a doctor, she’s a social worker.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah, we can set it up for you.

PATIENT H542
The last time @@@ meds.

DOCTOR H542
What's that?

PATIENT H542
The last time you saw me you were supposed to have the meds so then @@@ on the machine, uh the cell phone and then they said it wasn't orderable.

DOCTOR H542
And what wasn't orderable.

PATIENT H542
The inhaler.

DOCTOR H542
Oh, you mean.

PATIENT H542
So I don't know if you forgot to put it all in or what but it really screwed me up because then I had to go through hell to find a doctor or a pharmacist or somebody, finally got back to me and so @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Okay, so we're talking about your pump.

PATIENT H542
@@@ four different kinds.

DOCTOR H542
Okay you want it mailed to you?

PATIENT H542
Yeah, all the medications should be mailed.

DOCTOR H542
Okay so I'll put in the albuterol.  Have you been out of these?

PATIENT H542
The albuterol I was and I called them and went through a couple of hoops. @@@

DOCTOR H542
Okay.

PATIENT H542
They tell you one thing when you're on the phone and then you call up the Pharmacy oh no you can get it.

DOCTOR H542
Okay. Sorry about that.

PATIENT H542
That's alright.

DOCTOR H542
And you're on the mometasone.

PATIENT H542
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H542
You're on the formoterol and the albuterol.  Is there anything else that you're taking?

PATIENT H542
Yeah, there’s one other thing.

DOCTOR H542
There’s a fourth one?

PATIENT H542
Yeah.  Let me ask you the fancy name @@@ I can’t remember it. One is one you turn and it disperses the powder automatically every time you open it.

DOCTOR H542
Right.

PATIENT H542
The other two you have to pierce that capsule, @@@ the other two are the ones you carry around albuterol and the other one. Although I think they tried to combine them.

DOCTOR H542
The Combivent @@@.

PATIENT H542
Oh that's it.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah. That’s terrible. I'm really sorry that you needed to go without it.

PATIENT H542
Oh, it was – well, it is a big deal when you need it.  When I climbing the stairs, I'm on the second floor and it's got a third floor @@@, I got to rest halfway up and sit down on the stairs.  There's no way I can get one of those walkers with a seat is there?

DOCTOR H542
Um that's possible I think.  Do you feel like you need that?

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
Do you get shortness of breath?

PATIENT H542
No just like I said shortness of breath is one thing.  I get out of breath about a half a block to a block but it's the waiting for the buses, I take a lot of buses.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah.

PATIENT H542
And a lot of times there’s no seat there and I'll stay on my feet for 40 to 30 minutes and I'm telling you, it kills my legs really bad.

DOCTOR H542
Hmm.  Are you taking Tylenol for your pain?  Does that help?

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
Okay I'll renew that.

PATIENT H542
@@@.

DOCTOR H542
@@@ you still having bedbugs?

PATIENT H542
Oh yeah, we haven’t really @@@.

DOCTOR H542
And Dermatology gave you some stuff, does that help at all?

PATIENT H542
Yeah it helps.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.

PATIENT H542
They gave me something for the itching I'd never heard of @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H542
But then he gave me this pink stuff @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Calamine?

PATIENT H542
Yeah that's it.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.

PATIENT H542
And that helps a lot, especially after I just get them, I put it on and it doesn't itch at all @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Okay do you @@@.

PATIENT H542
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H542
Do you still have those @@@?

PATIENT H542
Uh I'm almost out.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.  Your blood pressure's doing pretty good.

PATIENT H542
Yeah I'm surprised because yesterday I took it, it was high and I had a slight fever, 99.1.

DOCTOR H542
Hmm.

PATIENT H542
I got a cold or something @@@ yellowish gray, I got an infection, I guess.

DOCTOR H542
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT H542
Oh I @@@.  I @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H542
I’m sucking those hard candies.  @@@ to try to cut down on the smoking.

DOCTOR H542
Did it help?

PATIENT H542
A bit but it's like giving me something to do @@@.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.  I just got over @@@ from that.  @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT H542
Yeah. @@@

DOCTOR H542
Okay.  Have you been having episodes of chest pain?

PATIENT H542
Uh only when I'm out of breath @@@ you know something @@@ hurts. Sucking air.

DOCTOR H542
Uh-huh.  So we could give you some @@@ mask thing.

PATIENT H542
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H542
Would you use it?

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
I think that'll help you to breathe.

PATIENT H542
I @@@ for the test and woke up and was half gasping for breath @@@. 

DOCTOR H542
@@@.  

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.

PATIENT H542
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H542
So your A1C, which is a measure for your diabetes is a little bit higher since August. I'm gonna give a little bit more so I think we should increase your diabetes medication.

PATIENT H542
Okay.

DOCTOR H542
Um.

PATIENT H542
I take two tablets now.

DOCTOR H542
Right we could give you the 500.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
And we can give you a finger stick, a glucose meter for at home.

PATIENT H542
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H542
Where you put the strips in the machine.

PATIENT H542
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.

PATIENT H542
Yeah, right I see.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah definitely we need to have you um start doing that.  I'm not sure you haven't done it before.

PATIENT H542
@@@.  There is no such thing as a borderline diabetic according to DOCTOR.

DOCTOR H542
There is.

PATIENT H542
Is there?

DOCTOR H542
Yeah there is.

PATIENT H542
Oh cause that's what I was told @@@.

DOCTOR H542
But now you're at the point where you're definitely diabetic.

PATIENT H542
Oh yeah, yeah.  @@@. I kinda figured that, but they never did tell me to take any kind of blood tests @@@ I don't know.  I guess they were treating me with medications.

DOCTOR H542
You're due for the TDAP vaccine are you gonna get that today?

PATIENT H542
What's that?

DOCTOR H542
Prevents tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis.

PATIENT H542
She asked me when the last time it was I got it and I said I don't know.

DOCTOR H542
The last time you had it was in 2000. You’re supposed to get it every ten years.

PATIENT H542
Oh okay.  Maybe if she'd have told me that, that I should get it.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah she can give it to you today.

PATIENT H542
Good.  Is it a long wait?

DOCTOR H542
No.  Um what about a colonoscopy?

PATIENT H542
Uh uh.

DOCTOR H542
Still don’t want that.

PATIENT H542
Not yet.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.  

PATIENT H542
Why are my legs all puffed up?

DOCTOR H542
It’s probably from, have you ever had tests done on your heart?  @@@.

PATIENT H542
Uh a couple of times.

DOCTOR H542
Let's see when that was doine.  It could be from different reasons.  It could be from your kidneys or @@@.

PATIENT H542
Sure.

DOCTOR H542
Um it could be from, it also could be from your heart if you have longstanding problems like diabetes and hypertension it can cause swelling in your legs, also the shortness of breath.  And @@@ smoking and lung disease.

PATIENT H542
Yeah I've been smoking a pipe, I never smoked @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Oh okay but still, it still um could be from that or it could be from the lungs or it could be from the heart.

PATIENT H542
I see.

DOCTOR H542
@@@ the swelling.

PATIENT H542
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.  So let me see when the last check-up you had was @@@.

PATIENT H542
And an EKG would be great.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
You had a stress test in 2003.

PATIENT H542
@@@ treadmill are they.

DOCTOR H542
No @@@.

PATIENT H542
Yeah, right.

DOCTOR H542
And I'll just @@@.

PATIENT H542
Hmm.

DOCTOR H542
It’s probably worth repeating.

PATIENT H542
Okay.

DOCTOR H542
Um @@@ echo @@@.  Okay, have a seat up here.  

PATIENT H542
You don’t have any new legs back there, somewhere, do you?

DOCTOR H542
What's that?

PATIENT H542
You don’t have a pair of new legs back there somewhere? Pop them on?

DOCTOR H542
New legs? I wish.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.  That would be nice.

DOCTOR H542
Um I referred you to the MOVE Clinic, the weight loss clinic. I didn’t see that you made that.

PATIENT H542
I didn’t see anything on there.

DOCTOR H542
Oh really.

PATIENT H542
Nobody contacted me, nobody called me.

DOCTOR H542
Hmm.

PATIENT H542
I @@@.

DOCTOR H542
@@@ deep breath okay.  @@@ look here @@@.

PATIENT H542
I don't like @@@.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.  You wouldn’t have gone if @@@ referred.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
How are you going to lose weight then?

PATIENT H542
I don't know.

DOCTOR H542
Open your mouth, say ah.

PATIENT H542
Ah.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.  

PATIENT H542
I know when my legs swell; I'm real tender under the stomach here.

DOCTOR H542
Really.

PATIENT H542
Yeah you push down and it hurts.

DOCTOR H542
Are you drinking alcohol?

PATIENT H542
Uh I don't do that.  @@@ I went to the ATP classes.  

DOCTOR H542
Really.  Take some deep breaths.  Again.  Your lungs sound pretty good.

PATIENT H542
Yeah they do @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah.

PATIENT H542
Usually I wheeze.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.  Let me see when the last time you had an EKG was.

PATIENT H542
Right.

DOCTOR H542
It's probably been some time, right?

PATIENT H542
Yeah, at least a year I think.

DOCTOR H542
2007.

PATIENT H542
I know.  @@@ the heart @@@ heart rate was 50 @@@ oh yeah.  I truly @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Hmm.  Your @@@.

PATIENT H542
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H542
Alright let me go talk to my boss.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT H542
Who's your boss?

DOCTOR H542
DOCTOR.

PATIENT H542
DOCTOR oh.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.

PATIENT H542
Very impressive.  @@@.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.

PATIENT H542
Laughs.

DOCTOR H542
I'll be right back.

PATIENT H542
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  62:28  DOCTOR IN:  72:38)

DOCTOR H542
Do you want to know the verdict? 

PATIENT H542
Alright doctor.

DOCTOR H542
So um I took a look at some of your cardiac studies, to try to see the performance.

PATIENT H542
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H542
We pulled it up and your echo looked okay.  I don't think, it's very unlikely to be coming from your heart.

PATIENT H542
Okay.

DOCTOR H542
Um it's probably from your combined asthma/obstructive sleep apnea. 

PATIENT H542
Okay.

DOCTOR H542
The blood pressures in the pulmonary arteries that are in the lungs is pretty high.

PATIENT H542
Oh okay.

DOCTOR H542
And that makes me think it's coming from here.

PATIENT H542
Oh okay.

DOCTOR H542
So I think with the CPAP uh that should help you.

PATIENT H542
Sounds good.

DOCTOR H542
But we can definitely, we're gonna start you on medication to help with the swelling in your legs.

PATIENT H542
@@@.

DOCTOR H542
Um and we also want to go up on your diabetes meds.

PATIENT H542
Okay.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.

PATIENT H542
Did you ask her about that little chair?

DOCTOR H542
Yeah we'll definitely look into that.

PATIENT H542
Great, terrific.

DOCTOR H542
Um.

PATIENT H542
It'll help me out in three different ways.

DOCTOR H542
You have to come back though for some blood work on this medication to help you pee and for the swelling because it can mess up your potassium and electrolytes and stuff.

PATIENT H542
Okay yeah you gotta keep track of that.

DOCTOR H542
We just have to follow it yeah.  Let's see here so.

PATIENT H542
Want a piece of candy?

DOCTOR H542
Oh no thanks I already had, I already ate.  I'm a diabetic too so.

PATIENT H542
Are you really?

DOCTOR H542
Yeah.

PATIENT H542
So you do that blood test and all the time too.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah I check my finger sticks three or four times a day.

PATIENT H542
Alright.

DOCTOR H542
So we're going up on the metformin.  So now you were taking 500 twice a day of the metformin for your diabetes.  Now you're gonna be taking twice that.  You're taking one gram.

PATIENT H542
Okay.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.  And let's see we are also going to start you on something called Lasix flushing the kidneys.  It helps to basically increase the amount of urine.

PATIENT H542
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR H542
It basically ups the urine.

PATIENT H542
I pee all the time anyway.

DOCTOR H542
I know but that might be because of the diabetes so if you get the blood sugars down then you might not pee as much.

PATIENT H542
Alright, alright.

DOCTOR H542
Now when you pee you'll actually.

PATIENT H542
Get @@@.

DOCTOR H542
Be @@@.

PATIENT H542
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR H542
So um but along with the pee, is it also @@@ potassium.

PATIENT H542
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR H542
Magnesium, stuff like that can get low.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
Check your levels.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
Check your levels a little bit.  We'll start with um, I think we're gonna start with 20 mg twice a day.  This stuff works for around six hours, so when you take it you have to put your legs up and then all that water will be resorbed into your body and @@@.

PATIENT H542
I @@@.

DOCTOR H542
It @@@.

PATIENT H542
I do that now, I elevate my legs as much as possible and I don't, nothing seems to help.  

DOCTOR H542
Can you give us a urine test today too?

PATIENT H542
Sure.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.

PATIENT H542
I'm a giving guy.

DOCTOR H542
Great.

PATIENT H542
How many gallons do they want?

DOCTOR H542
As much as you can make, I guess.  Um let's see here, I’ll order the labs now.  You should come back in probably about two weeks to get your blood tests checked.

PATIENT H542
Okay.

DOCTOR H542
Then I'll follow up myself to let you know.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
If something's abnormal.

PATIENT H542
And what about the compression stockings?

DOCTOR H542
Yeah I'll order them now.  That, as you know, takes a little bit of time.  I'll give you a call and let you know if they're in.

PATIENT H542
Oh they've got them up there all the time?

DOCTOR H542
They, if you go up there immediately yeah.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
I'll put in the order.

PATIENT H542
If it's in the computer they got them.  If it ain't in the computer they don't have it.

DOCTOR H542
Let's see here and one of the notes has the size in there so let me see what your size was.

PATIENT H542
I think it's like the second from the top.  Yeah I get these shooting pains all the way down to my toes right now.

DOCTOR H542
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H542
Yeah in my legs to my toe.  

DOCTOR H542
@@@ walker.

PATIENT H542
Yeah.

DOCTOR H542
@@@.  

PATIENT H542
Sure would help me out.  

DOCTOR H542
Are you gonna pick it up or how will we get it to you?

PATIENT H542
Well it would be coming from Prosthetics.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah.

PATIENT H542
Yeah I'd go up and get it.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.  Okay so we're gonna have you see the nurse in three weeks um.

PATIENT H542
This stuff shows in the print-out, oh yes.

DOCTOR H542
Yeah well they'll, I think they make the appointment for you and then they'll give you something to take home to remind you.

PATIENT H542
Alright.

DOCTOR H542
And then also I'll send you a letter when you're gonna see me next as well.

PATIENT H542
Okay.

DOCTOR H542
Okay.  So.

PATIENT H542
Well I don't, I'll probably hear now.

DOCTOR H542
And TDAP.

PATIENT H542
Oh for what?  Keep that?

DOCTOR H542
No TDAP vaccine.

PATIENT H542
Oh that's right.  Do I just go to the nurse now and get it?

DOCTOR H542
Yeah I think you, oh the pulmonary function; I'll put that in there now.

PATIENT H542
You want it right now?

DOCTOR H542
I think @@@ regular @@@ yeah over here and um.  You already have your appointment right?

PATIENT H542
No.

DOCTOR H542
You didn't have it right?

PATIENT H542
All I know is I went overnight and I never heard back and that was it.  So I figured @@@.

DOCTOR H542
So I'll talk to them.  So the pulmonary appointment and @@@ up front and we'll be able to see you back @@@.

PATIENT H542
Okay thank you.  Your name is DOCTOR?

DOCTOR H542
