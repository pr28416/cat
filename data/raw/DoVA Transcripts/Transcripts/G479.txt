Now I was taking four or five medicines for the uh the irregular heartbeat.  They put me on four or five different medicines, one of them is metoprolol.  I think that's the one that makes your mouth dry and you @@@ breathe but then there was a small cough and so he wanted me to talk to somebody in Pulmonary.  But we changing that until you get to finish with that.  The breathing was @@@ and then when I cough, rales but I couldn't cough it up because whatever it is @@@.

PATIENT G479
Yeah I got the chest x-ray the same day she prescribed the antibiotics.

DOCTOR G479
Good.  Uh okay.  It shows there wasn't much change but they wanted to treat you cause you're having all these really bad symptoms so how did the thing go yesterday?

PATIENT G479
Okay I guess.  They get it back in rhythm.

DOCTOR G479

Right, right.  Um are you still smoking?  You quit a while back right?

DOCTOR G479
Yeah.

PATIENT G479
It's keeping me tired and it's like I'm sleepy but @@@ so I got to probably wait and see what's gonna happen with that.

DOCTOR G479
And you think it's the metoprolol?

PATIENT G479
I think, I wasn't @@@ until he put me on the metoprolol.

DOCTOR G479
How long ago was that?  @@@.

PATIENT G479
January.

DOCTOR G479
Okay.  So since then you've had a lot of, you've been sleepy.

PATIENT G479
And the shortness of breath.  Especially one of them, @@@.

DOCTOR G479
Okay, okay.  

PATIENT G479
I'm trying to find, I have been trying to get something for my ankles cause my feet are swelling up real big.

DOCTOR G479
Do you take a water pill?

PATIENT G479
I was taking the water pill and then they finally start going down but I was just taking some.

DOCTOR G479
Does it hurt?  Is it painful?

PATIENT G479
No I was taking some borrowed water pills which you're not supposed to do.  Cause I wasn't getting nothing for my.

DOCTOR G479
You need to get you your own, you don't have to borrow them.

PATIENT G479
Well I have been telling these people for the last month about how big my ankle swelling, my feet were swelling up and then @@@.  Now I had 12 pills but none of them was a derivative so.  

DOCTOR G479
Well hopefully now that your heart's in a good rhythm, that'll help too.  We can get you a little bit of a water pill.  Have a seat here.  When are you supposed to see the cardiologist back?

PATIENT G479
Let me see.

DOCTOR G479
Yeah it's not on there.

PATIENT G479
Okay, so.

DOCTOR G479
We'll get you an appointment in a couple of weeks.  Let me see what their last note said.  Can you lean forward so I can listen to you?  Deep breath in and out.  Okay.  Just breathe normal.  Are you using your inhalers?

PATIENT G479
Yeah.

DOCTOR G479
And what about the Coumadin, was there a question about the Coumadin?

PATIENT G479
Yeah I talked to the person in the Pharmacy and they said now you have to keep taking it until you see the cardiologist.

DOCTOR G479
Right.

PATIENT G479
But I have no appointment to see the cardiologist until @@@

DOCTOR G479
Yeah we'll see what.

PATIENT G479
And I supposed to I guess, uh she yesterday @@@ I don't know @@@ notify them or not.

DOCTOR G479
Okay.  Do you want these mailed to you or do you want to pick them up?

PATIENT G479
What?

DOCTOR G479
The water pill.

PATIENT G479
You can mail them to me.

DOCTOR G479
Alright.  Okay.  Let me talk to DOCTOR and we'll if we can probably get you, uh you can probably start decreasing that metoprolol, that's causing some of the problems.  How much are you taking, do you know?  Do you remember?

PATIENT G479
About half a pill three times a day.

DOCTOR G479
Okay.  We may be able to just take you completely off that to see how you do and we'll get you in to see the cardiologist to see her within the month okay.

PATIENT G479
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G479
I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  64:24  DOCTOR IN:  70:19)

DOCTOR G479
Alright here, so we'll get you an appointment in to see your cardiologist and @@@ um there's that.

PATIENT G479
Okay.

DOCTOR G479
We can have you stop both the metoprolol and the Coumadin now that the shock went well and now the rhythm's normal.  If it gets abnormal again, if you're having any symptoms uh having the chest palpitations, having the severe shortness of breath you should come in to the Emergency Department okay.  Because that can always happen.  

PATIENT G479
Okay so since they got my heart back in rhythm.

DOCTOR G479
Yeah.

PATIENT G479
So that's the end of the pacemaker right?

DOCTOR G479
Um you don't have a pacemaker.

PATIENT G479
I know.

DOCTOR G479
Okay.

PATIENT G479
That was talking about putting one in.

DOCTOR G479
We'll see.  If you stay in this rhythm yeah it's the end of the pacemaker, you don't need it.  Uh I think they're also concerned about, yeah I think that's the issue is that they can't, if you're heart's in normal rhythm you don't get a pacer.  If it's beating fast and they can't stop it then you need to have - not an operation but where they burn the place that's been getting a little fast and they put in a pacemaker so you don't need that.

PATIENT G479
They burned it, I thought they just took a little old @@@ insert @@@.

DOCTOR G479
They do that but what they have to do is that uh what's happening is there's a lot of electrical activity making the heart beat fast.

PATIENT G479
Oh okay.

DOCTOR G479
So they got to buzz that place where that's causing all the problems.  If they do that then the heart will slow down really slow and you need a pacemaker.

PATIENT G479
Oh okay.  @@@.  Okay.

DOCTOR G479
So if it happens again I don't know we'll have to talk about that again.

PATIENT G479
Alright.

DOCTOR G479
But we'll get a repeat ultrasound of the heart.

PATIENT G479
Okay.

DOCTOR G479
Alright you take care.
