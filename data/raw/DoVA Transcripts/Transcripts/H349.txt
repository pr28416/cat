DOCTOR H349
Which aneurysm?

PATIENT H349
It was on the right kidney renal artery.

DOCTOR H349

PATIENT H349
That's where they first discovered it when they did the scan.

DOCTOR H349
Yeah.

PATIENT H349

DOCTOR H349
Oh, well Hines is pretty far for you.

PATIENT H349
It's 34 miles.

DOCTOR H349
You have a closer clinic if you want to go there.

PATIENT H349
Uh there's one in Peotone I think it is.

DOCTOR H349
Yeah.

PATIENT H349
And there's one in Crown Point, Indiana.  There's a small one I think in Chicago Heights.

DOCTOR H349
Yeah.

PATIENT H349
But uh yeah I don't know.  I suppose I could go to one of those.

DOCTOR H349
Well it's just up to you yeah.

PATIENT H349
Yeah.

DOCTOR H349
That's a pretty far drive um and some of the other clinics you know are coordinated with other hospitals.

PATIENT H349
Yeah.

DOCTOR H349
Like if like if you've gone somewhere in Indiana.

PATIENT H349
Yeah.

DOCTOR H349
I know like Hines would be like further south would be like Oak Lawn I think.

PATIENT H349
Oh okay.

DOCTOR H349
And so you know some those just kind of divide it up.

PATIENT H349
Yeah.

DOCTOR H349
You know and I Chicago Heights is maybe with Jesse Brown but I know Oak Lawn for sure is like with Hines.

PATIENT H349
Hmm.  Chicago Heights is the St. Janeâ€™s Hospital.

DOCTOR H349
Yeah.

PATIENT H349
And South Suburban is nearby and Olympia Fields.

DOCTOR H349
Okay, okay.  Well maybe like if it's easier for you.  You know you could always transfer to one of the outlying clinics you know.

PATIENT H349
Yeah.

DOCTOR H349
Um yeah.  But the only thing I want to do today is I'll put in a renewal for your medications I just need to check some of these labs @@@.

PATIENT H349
Yeah I'll either mail that or fax it to you as soon as I can get that.

DOCTOR H349
Um probably we can check on, the only thing I can't check today is the cholesterol.

PATIENT H349
Yeah.

DOCTOR H349
For the cholesterol you have to fast.  

PATIENT H349
Yeah.

DOCTOR H349
I just need to check basic, basic labs.

PATIENT H349
I see, yeah.

DOCTOR H349
So you can see, I'm going to do that up here and we'll see if @@@.  Um, cause I think the last labs we have here in our system is 2008.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

DOCTOR H349
A couple of years ago, so we should get some, you know.  Lipitor 80 mg.  No problems with the medications at all that you're aware of?

PATIENT H349
No.

DOCTOR H349
Okay.  Have they changed your doses recently?

PATIENT H349
No they've been the same.  I asked about that and he said well we'll just stick with them for now.

DOCTOR H349
Okay.  Okay let me talk to my attending I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  64:44  DOCTOR IN:  71:10)

DOCTOR H349
Okay, so these okay let me see.  Have been on the Lipitor for a while, have they changed the dose, do you know?

PATIENT H349
Uh I am due for renewal of the prescriptions at some point.

DOCTOR H349
Okay, but I mean have you changed the dose recently?

PATIENT H349
No.

DOCTOR H349
Okay.  So I have a couple of questions.  We need to check lab work before I can refill your medicines.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

DOCTOR H349
You know, what I can do, there's a couple of options.  So one thing is we can check most of the labs today um.

PATIENT H349
How much what?

DOCTOR H349
We could check most of the lab work today.

PATIENT H349
Oh okay yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR H349
So that would make all the meds okay except for the Lipitor.

PATIENT H349
Oh okay.

DOCTOR H349
You know, so we have a couple of options.  I could either check all the labs today and redo all of your medications through here except for the Lipitor.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

DOCTOR H349
And then I'd either need the records of fasting lipids you know the cholesterol.

PATIENT H349
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR H349
Or have you come back and do the fasting lab before I give you the Lipitor.

PATIENT H349
Oh I see yeah.

DOCTOR H349
Or we could just hold off and have you come back in a week or so and get all the lab work done and then I could renew all the medicines.

PATIENT H349
Sure.

DOCTOR H349
Which one works better for you?

PATIENT H349
@@@ test done, you the result.

DOCTOR H349
Well what we could do is we could check all the lab work today.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

DOCTOR H349
Then I could refill all the meds except for the Lipitor.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

DOCTOR H349
Then I could just give you the fax number and you could fax over the.

PATIENT H349
Sure.

DOCTOR H349
Your cholesterol and then we could give you the Lipitor.

PATIENT H349
Okay that'll work fine.

DOCTOR H349
Okay.  Um, let's see here.  I'll have them do the labs @@@.  Um so one thing is, we don't have that exact one but have an equivalent.

PATIENT H349
Is that lisinopril?

DOCTOR H349
Lisinopril.

PATIENT H349
Yeah that's what I've been getting.

DOCTOR H349
Okay.  Cause that @@@.

PATIENT H349
Oh okay.

DOCTOR H349

PATIENT H349
I know all of them have two or three or four names.

DOCTOR H349
Right.  Um, @@@ is like, I mean it's in the same class.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

DOCTOR H349
So I added the lisinopril 2.5.

PATIENT H349
Okay it's up to you whatever.

DOCTOR H349
It's equivalent.

PATIENT H349
Yeah whatever gets the job done.

DOCTOR H349
Let me see, lisinopril.  (Doctor working on computer)  Okay lisinopril, the Plavix, the aspirin, Fosamax, Synthroid, the lisinopril and metoprolol @@@.  So today we'll do the lab work they'll do electrolytes, your lipids and thyroid.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

DOCTOR H349
Okay so we'll get the lab work today up here.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

DOCTOR H349
And then um, I'll have to give you the fax number out front um that way, we need to look at the cholesterol if you'll just fax it.  I'll have you fax it over here.

PATIENT H349
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR H349
Um, otherwise you know, just have you come back next year.

PATIENT H349
Yeah.

DOCTOR H349
Okay but if some of the other clinics are closer to you, if you'd like transfer over there.

PATIENT H349
Sure.

DOCTOR H349
No problem and then um you know once I get the @@@ of the cholesterol I'll renew the Lipitor.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

DOCTOR H349
Okay and oh yeah so when you come back, if do a lot of lab work from outside doctors.

PATIENT H349
Yeah.

DOCTOR H349
And you don't want to repeat it, just the next time you get the lab work always get a paper copy for yourself.

PATIENT H349
Okay.

DOCTOR H349
And when you bring it in.

PATIENT H349
Yeah.

DOCTOR H349
As long as you have records of some lab work.
