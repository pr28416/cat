DOCTOR T031
I have to or I'm not going to get through everything.

PATIENT T031
I’m scared of you.

DOCTOR T031
Well I used to play piano, I think that's why.

PATIENT T031
Oh, that helps.

DOCTOR T031
Well let's kind of make our way through some of these things that we talked about last time.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
So your blood pressure is um, it’s okay.  

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
It's 136/74 today.

PATIENT T031
Hmm.

DOCTOR T031
And you are still taking the losartan 25 mg a day and then you have chlorthalidone 25 mg as well okay so let me renew these medications.

PATIENT T031
Thank you.

DOCTOR T031
I'm just going to do @@@ managing our medicines.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Alright and we talked about constipation last time.

PATIENT T031
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T031
Are you taking fiber supplements?

PATIENT T031
I take them every week.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
Every week yeah.

DOCTOR T031
Oh every week?

PATIENT T031
Every day.

DOCTOR T031
Oh every day.

PATIENT T031
Every day yeah and it works fine.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
Yeah so you can renew that too.  If you don't mind.

DOCTOR T031
Oh I don't mind.  Anything to keep in order here.  Alright and for your cholesterol and I don't have your current cholesterol, since it didn't get it drawn.

PATIENT T031
That's why I gotta do the blood.  Just tell them one reason is because like I don't like needles.

DOCTOR T031
Hmm.  Well.

PATIENT T031
Well I'm gonna have to have it done so.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Alright so last time, let's see what did we talk about.  You told me that you were previously on simvastatin but then you were told you don't need it anymore so you stopped it.

PATIENT T031
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T031
Uh and so that's why we were wanting to check your fasting lipids.

PATIENT T031
What about that thing?  What do you call that where they want to check inside your behind, what was that?

DOCTOR T031
The prostrate enzymes?  Or are you talking about like the actual exam?  The digital rectal exam?

PATIENT T031
Yeah, do I have to do that?

DOCTOR T031
It's, no you don't have to do that.  It's something you only do if there's a reason to do it.

PATIENT T031
Cause I think I did it like two or three years ago, something like that.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T031
Is that in the records?

DOCTOR T031
Um I’d have to look back to find it but.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
I mean it's not something we have to do unless you need it.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
So let's, we'll get there in a second.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Um so for your cholesterol last time we basically decided that we could start you on a medication if you're still high so I'll have to see what your labs show, okay.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Um so I'll wait for that and then we talked about uh erectile dysfunction and you're using let's see what I have.

PATIENT T031
They changed it.

DOCTOR T031
Yes they changed it to Viagra.

PATIENT T031
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah.

PATIENT T031
I need more.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
Uh and they only give me two pills.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah @@@ but I'm expecting @@@.

PATIENT T031
Thank you.

DOCTOR T031
Um I'll have to give you more refills.

PATIENT T031
Okay.  Cause I need more pills.

DOCTOR T031
Um.  Now how much of the pills do you need at one time?

PATIENT T031
Um.

DOCTOR T031
Are you taking a full pill?

PATIENT T031
Yeah.

DOCTOR T031
Okay have you ever tried using half a pill?  You didn't?

PATIENT T031
I mean for the last uh, not the Viagra but it was something else, they called it something else.

DOCTOR T031
Right, right I know.

PATIENT T031
And uh I used to cut that in half and um but they gave me four pills and I cut that in half.  Now they gave me two.

DOCTOR T031
Right.

PATIENT T031
I mean I can cut those in half.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah.

PATIENT T031
But can I get four like I did the last time?

DOCTOR T031
Yeah you know let me see if it'll let me do that.  Unfortunately they have a limit on those sort of things.

PATIENT T031
@@@.

DOCTOR T031
Let me see if they'll let me order more for you.  Yeah they, so you're using a full tablet?

PATIENT T031
Yeah.  I mean I could use a.

DOCTOR T031
So why don't we change your.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
This is what I'm gonna do um the most it'll let me do I think is four pills cause it gives you enough for four times.

PATIENT T031
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR T031
So let me see if.

PATIENT T031
Because the old prescription they gave me four and I cut those in half.

DOCTOR T031
Right.

PATIENT T031
Okay and I don't know if those will vary.  These pills are bigger than the pills that I had from the original prescription.  I don't know if that means it's more potent, I don't know if that's any.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah they don't have the exact same potency.  I would have to look it up.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
For you yeah but it doesn't mean that you need more.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
It’s just a different medication.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Alright uh and then are you still using Depakote, citalopram as well?

PATIENT T031
Yeah, I have to.

DOCTOR T031
Okay good.  And do you ever find yourself, do you still take propranolol regularly for the tremor?

PATIENT T031
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
Well periodically.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
No a lot, just periodically.

DOCTOR T031
How often?

PATIENT T031
Uh maybe once every other week.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
And sometimes if I remember to do so um.  I haven't had tremors for a long time.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
But I take them anyway.

DOCTOR T031
Alright and then are you still using terbinafine for athlete's foot?

PATIENT T031
I need some yes.  I need some now.

DOCTOR T031
Hmm.

PATIENT T031
(Patient's phone rings, he answers it)  I'm sorry.

DOCTOR T031
Oh don't worry about it.

PATIENT T031
I guess it wasn't important okay.  Sorry about that.

DOCTOR T031
No problem.  Alright are you still using acyclovir for genital herpes?

PATIENT T031
(Patient's phone rings) Yes.  I'm sorry.

DOCTOR T031
No worries.

PATIENT T031
(Patient answers phone call).  I'm sorry.  Yes in fact recently I was going through this stress thing in my life a month and a half ago and before it developed into a full open sore.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T031
I just saturated myself with that acyclovir.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
And I caught them in time.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
I caught it in time.

DOCTOR T031
So I'm renewing your prescription for you to take as needed.

PATIENT T031
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR T031
Um are you still using meloxicam?

PATIENT T031
What is that?

DOCTOR T031
For pain?

PATIENT T031
No.

DOCTOR T031
So for your left ankle pain?

PATIENT T031
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm still taking that.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.  Renew that.  How often do you find yourself taking that?

PATIENT T031
I take that like every other day.  Every other day.  Sometimes I find my ankle locking.  I mean it actually locks.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T031
And uh I have to, it takes about may an hour, hour and a half of you know walking on it to get it loosened up you know, it hurts but you have to do what you have to do.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.  Now would you like another prostate enzyme ordered?  Your last one was normal, it was 0.18 in February 2010, so it's been a couple years.

PATIENT T031
Now what's the prostate, what does that do?

DOCTOR T031
So the prostate is uh the enzyme basically we tell to see if it's getting really high really quick and that would mean that you either have enlarged prostate or possibly prostate cancer so it's a screening test.

PATIENT T031
How do they do it?

DOCTOR T031
It's just a blood test.

PATIENT T031
Oh they just take blood from you.

DOCTOR T031
Yes, yes.

PATIENT T031
They don't stick nothing like no tube up, nothing like that.

DOCTOR T031
No, no, no, no, no.

PATIENT T031
Alright.

DOCTOR T031
Now if your PSA is abnormal then I would do that exam, I'd do a rectal exam.  You know if you need to have one you can always decline it, but um you know that's to be sure.

PATIENT T031
Okay.  Let's say you're gonna do that now that means okay the more @@@ tests that you have for me.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T031
That means the more tubes for blood they're gonna ask for?

DOCTOR T031
Yeah I mean not like a whole lot more cause they can get a lot from one tube.

PATIENT T031
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR T031
It depends on the kind of tests.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Cause sometimes they can be prepared differently so they're going to have to get a separate tube just for one test.

PATIENT T031
There is a question that I'd like to ask you.

DOCTOR T031
Sure.

PATIENT T031
It's kind of embarrassing, but you’re my doctor.

DOCTOR T031
No yeah, what is it?

PATIENT T031
I don't know uh, I'd like to find out, is there something I can take to find out if I am sterile?

DOCTOR T031
So why do you think your sterile?

PATIENT T031
Well I mean my wife's not getting pregnant.

DOCTOR T031
Okay so you're trying?

PATIENT T031
Well I mean, I don't use any type of uh you know protection with my wife or anything like that.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T031
But as much as we have been you know having physical activities and sex then I'm kind of surprised we've been married since 2005 and it kind of surprises me she hasn't gotten pregnant.

DOCTOR T031
Okay so since 2005 you've basically been trying, in general?

PATIENT T031
Well not trying but you know you would think that.

DOCTOR T031
Right.  By trying I mean you're not using any protection.

PATIENT T031
Right, right, right.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
So I'm wondering if it's me or if it's her.

DOCTOR T031
Well so the first question is do you want to have children?

PATIENT T031
She wants to have children.

DOCTOR T031
So then again, the question is do you as a couple want to have children?

PATIENT T031
If she want it, if we have a child then I'm for it.

DOCTOR T031
You're for it.

PATIENT T031
Yeah I'm for it.

DOCTOR T031
So the most important question first of all to ask you is have you agreed that yes you want children because if that hasn't been figured out then I would recommend against going down that road.

PATIENT T031
But she wants one.

DOCTOR T031
Right.

PATIENT T031
And and.

DOCTOR T031
But you have to be on board.

PATIENT T031
I'm on board, I'm on board.  I mean it's not something I'm gung ho and gonna run down the street and I want a child, I want a child, but if it happens; because she really, really wants to have a child uh uh yeah I would be on board.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
Yeah.

DOCTOR T031
Now I'll have to ask my attending what the VA, if anything, offers.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Generally you would go to a fertility clinic to kind of have that worked up you know.  At this point you don't even know if it's you or your wife right?

PATIENT T031
Right.

DOCTOR T031
And there can be a thousand different reasons for it. Um.  So.

PATIENT T031
What could cause infertility?

DOCTOR T031
I mean if you just, if you have low sperm counts uh, excessive stress in your life will do that as well.  You won't be able to have enough sperm to increase your chance of getting pregnant and in the woman it could be a lot of different things, maybe she doesn't ovulate or maybe she's gotten pregnant but has had miscarriages and not known you know there's a lot of genetic things that give you that or.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Or problems with the uterus.  So I mean there's a wide variety of things.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
That could be so I'll ask my attending what he would recommend uh you know where he would think would be the best place for you to be referred.  But the reason I was asking about the children is that if you don't want any children as a couple then there's no point in going down that road just to find out who it is.

PATIENT T031
She wants one and like I said I would be on board for it.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.  Okay, alright I'll ask about that.

PATIENT T031
Thank you.

DOCTOR T031
Um and then I mean the rest of everything that we talked about is really just dependent on the labs that you get done so I'll have to look at those and call you with the results if you need any medication.

PATIENT T031
Okay is this going to be an appointment or just.

DOCTOR T031
No you can just get them drawn since I've already seen you today.  I mean it would have been nice if you'd gotten them done before so I could talk to you about it here but um you know whenever, at your convenience, come in, get fasting labs done and then the results will come to me and I can look at it and call you.

PATIENT T031
Now fasting, what time should the fast start?

DOCTOR T031
As long as it's 12-14 hours it doesn't matter.  So most people prefer to fast while they're sleeping you know.

PATIENT T031
So 12-14 hours so we're talking my fast would probably have to start.

DOCTOR T031
So after dinner don't eat anything.

PATIENT T031
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR T031
And then the next morning you can come in.

PATIENT T031
So 7 o'clock that would probably be the last time.

DOCTOR T031
Right uh-huh.

PATIENT T031
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.  Um alright and then there's alright I'm going to have you sit up there for me and give you the physical exam.

PATIENT T031
I'm overweight.

DOCTOR T031
You have gained weight since the last time you were here.

PATIENT T031
Yeah.

DOCTOR T031
Um like ten pounds or so I think.  How do you feel about that?  What do you think about going up?

PATIENT T031
I feel bad.

DOCTOR T031
What do you think is going on?

PATIENT T031
Well I keep eating.  You know, I like to eat but I haven't been able to do, you know I haven't been able to exercise that much.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T031
You know I think a lot of it has a lot to do with eating and sleeping and eating late at night and sleeping on top of that.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah.

PATIENT T031
Yeah so.

DOCTOR T031
Well it seems like you know, you just have to find the motivation to change it right?

PATIENT T031
I really don't watch what I eat but I guess health-wise I'm going to have to make some changes.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah.

PATIENT T031
I've done it before.

DOCTOR T031
That will help fertility as well.

PATIENT T031
Oh it will.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.  So obese patients have a much harder time.

PATIENT T031
Are you saying I'm fat?

DOCTOR T031
Well I mean yeah a little bit.

PATIENT T031
You're not right, but I like you you're telling me the truth okay.

DOCTOR T031
I mean you have to look at your belly, you know what I mean.

PATIENT T031
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR T031
You may even feel like hey I've got guns and I've got muscles but you can also have fat.

PATIENT T031
I feel it because when I do some prolonged walking, which I can't do that but whenever I have to do some prolonged walking I can feel my stomach pulling down and it puts a lot of stress on my back.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T031
So.

DOCTOR T031
That's a very good point, because you will get back pain because of your imbalance.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Alright I'm going to look in your eyes.  Straight ahead.  Straight ahead.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Okay open your mouth, stick out your tongue and say ah.

PATIENT T031
Ah.

DOCTOR T031
Let me listen to your neck first, you can just breathe normally.  Alright deep breaths in and out through your mouth.  Any swelling in your legs?

PATIENT T031
Yeah I've had swelling in my legs.

DOCTOR T031
Is that new?

PATIENT T031
I think it's because of the fact I haven't been drinking a lot of water.

DOCTOR T031
Okay you don't have any swelling now.

PATIENT T031
I don't.

DOCTOR T031
Barely.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
No if you stick your finger in like this.

PATIENT T031
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T031
And you see that there's a hole or like a pit.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
I would say that's.

PATIENT T031
Okay.  It's just in my calves uh you know.

DOCTOR T031
Do you feel like they're bigger than usual?

PATIENT T031
Oh yeah, they're hard.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah you have a little bit of swelling here.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
See how I'm pressing down and you get.

PATIENT T031
Oh wow.  So what is that?  I don't have cancer do I?

DOCTOR T031
No.  No sometimes it's just from the veins not doing their job.  So you have to make sure that you're using your muscles.  You know if you feel like you're not walking enough uh you know once you been on your legs all day a lot of people get a lot of swelling.

PATIENT T031
That's sometimes that's what happens so.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah so you want to keep exercising throughout the day.  You want to keep moving your legs cause the more your muscles contract the more that blood gets pushed up and you get less swelling right.  And then at the end of the day you want to elevate your legs as well.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
So you want to press on the bone, this is your shin and usually you got to press a little harder when you're on the bone, press in, let go and see this pitting?

PATIENT T031
Yeah.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah.

PATIENT T031
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR T031
Okay, let me go talk to my attending really quick and I'll be right back.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  27:11  DOCTOR IN:  34:15)

DOCTOR T031
I'm sorry.  Um okay so a couple of things.  So basically what my attending recommended was to send you to Urology and they can do a semen analysis and that's where we'd start.  Obviously for your wife you know she needs to get worked up elsewhere to see what it is.

PATIENT T031
Right.

DOCTOR T031
Um so what you could do is first you go to GU  and see if there’s anything they find and if not then she can try to get you worked up.  Let me ask you a question.

PATIENT T031
Could you recommend, can you uh make an appointment for me to go to.

DOCTOR T031
For Urology?  I'm going to send a consult and they're going to call you.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
And then they'll kind of work with you for whenever you're available.  Um do you have any children, have you ever had children?

PATIENT T031
Yes.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
All my children are grown um uh.  We've been married, like I said since 2005 and we haven't had you know any children.

DOCTOR T031
Sure.

PATIENT T031
And uh she has been excited and excited.

DOCTOR T031
Has she.

PATIENT T031
Yes she has.  She has two children.

DOCTOR T031
Okay.

PATIENT T031
Um from someone else and so she wants a child from me and I'm on board, I'm on board if and when she gets pregnant I would be excited.  You know I'll be old but I'll be excited about it uh so that was and then when I found out that uh that the doses, I don't know about milligrams or anything like that but the dose is strong.  The pills that I used to get.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T031
Was reduced from four to two I said wow, so well.

DOCTOR T031
Uh it means nothing.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Because it's a totally different medication.

PATIENT T031
Right.

DOCTOR T031
So it's a different potency.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Um.

PATIENT T031
Did that increase, did it go through?

DOCTOR T031
Yeah I did, I ordered.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
But they don't allow you to pick it up.

PATIENT T031
Right, right, right, yeah, right, right.

DOCTOR T031
They're going to mail it.

PATIENT T031
Right, right, right.

DOCTOR T031
It'll be like a week.

PATIENT T031
Right, right.  There's a certain time of the month that they allow it right.

DOCTOR T031
Alright.  Okay so I'm going to put in that consult for you right now.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Did you ever get that medication organizer?

PATIENT T031
Yes I did.

DOCTOR T031
Okay are you using it?

PATIENT T031
Yes I did, yes I am.  It's very, very, very beneficial for me yes.

DOCTOR T031
That's awesome.

PATIENT T031
Yeah.  Are you here like what once a week or once a month?

DOCTOR T031
No we're here for a week every five weeks.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
So it's a little weird, it kind of changes things around.

PATIENT T031
So if something should happen.

DOCTOR T031
You can still call into the clinic.  Do you have my card?

PATIENT T031
No I don't.

DOCTOR T031
Um.

PATIENT T031
Your name on it?

DOCTOR T031
Yep.  You can call that number I mean the nurses are always here so they can triage and if you need to be seen right away there's other people around that can see you.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Um or they can just give me an alert and say you want to talk to me I'll call you.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
That I can do at any point.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
And obviously you know if you feel like you're ill enough you can go obviously to the ER at any point um so that shouldn't be an issue.

PATIENT T031
Okay.  It's just always good because every time I go somewhere or whatever and if somebody asks well you know what is your doctor's name, who's your primary care physician.

DOCTOR T031
Then you know.

PATIENT T031
Yeah I could never remember your name, I have this in my wallet.  Cause I got a CWT case manager and she asked and she said well according to the computer you have a man, I said no I don't I have a lady.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah they don't know @@@. 

PATIENT T031
It may be @@@.

DOCTOR T031
Well the thing is because my boss is a male.

PATIENT T031
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR T031
Cause I'm under his name.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
That's why they do that.  But I'm technically your doctor so when you call me, if he's around then he can also talk to you.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Cause I talked to him about your case.

PATIENT T031
Thank you.

DOCTOR T031
So I think we're all set.  I'm going to have you come back in three months and I want you to get the labs done as soon as possible.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
So if you get them done next week that'd be awesome.

PATIENT T031
Okay uh if you want me to come back in three months.

DOCTOR T031
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T031
Could you make it on a Friday?

DOCTOR T031
Yeah you can, I mean that would be up to the scheduling but you can ask them for a Friday appointment.

PATIENT T031
Okay, okay, okay thank you.

DOCTOR T031
I don't know that they'll actually make your appointment today.  They'll just send you a letter a month before so but you know I have clinic all week so that should be fine.  Did you ever go to the UIC Dental School for?

PATIENT T031
You know what; no I never did make it over there.  Um I had a lot of things going on um within the past year or so but um I will say within the next couple of months um I will probably have the time to do so but UIC, they do have a clinic over there.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah but I think it's.

PATIENT T031
But you have to pay like a little fee.

DOCTOR T031
So it's a dental school so the medical or dental students to it with uh you know obviously um with somebody overseeing everything.

PATIENT T031
Right.

DOCTOR T031
But because it's people in training it costs a lot less.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Than if you went to a private dentist.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
And unfortunately at the VA they don't, the dental care here is horrendous I mean they don't treat anyone unless you're like dying of it.

PATIENT T031
Or homeless.  If you're homeless with them you have to be homeless, that's what I here you have to be homeless for 90 days uh, yeah 90 days and then they'll see you and then anything and everything you need to have done then they'll take care of it and then after that, that's it.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah.

PATIENT T031
That's it, that's it, okay yeah I got that.

DOCTOR T031
Unfortunately.  Uh okay and then your PSA too, you'll have that done.  Okay.  I think you're all set.

PATIENT T031
So if you get the results of it and if I require medication. Or are you going to add that.

DOCTOR T031
Well no, oh for the other labs yes, if you require medication I'll call you and talk to you about it.

PATIENT T031
Okay and you'll add that on.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah and that'll get mailed to you.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Yep.  That won't be an issue.  Um let's see.  I'm going to have to send you to Urology now.  

PATIENT T031
How are they going to take a sample of my semen are they gonna stick a needle?

DOCTOR T031
No uh I think generally you know you have to, you've probably seen it in movies or on TV, they probably give you a room where you go and you just have to masturbate um.

PATIENT T031
That's how they do it?

DOCTOR T031
Generally that's how they do it.

PATIENT T031
Oh.  Well that's very.

DOCTOR T031
They'll tell you, they'll tell you, I don't know at the VA exactly what they do but that's generally how it works.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
Because if you wait too long, if they have you do it at home you can have all kinds of uh you know lab abnormalities.  They need it to be fresh.

PATIENT T031
Oh okay so if that's the case, if that's the procedure I would have to come in here and they would grab it right away and take it.

DOCTOR T031
Yeah.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
And they actually require some labs too so they ordered testosterone and things like that so you'll have that too when you come for your labs.

PATIENT T031
Okay so I would have to.

DOCTOR T031
So the labs are all in here.  You don't have to anything you just tell them you're here for all your labs that are still pending and they'll draw everything.

PATIENT T031
So Urology put.

DOCTOR T031
Well I put in a consult in and it automatically orders it.

PATIENT T031
Oh, oh, okay.

DOCTOR T031
Cause they require them.

PATIENT T031
Okay, okay, alright.

DOCTOR T031
Okay, alright.

PATIENT T031
Okay.

DOCTOR T031
We're done.

PATIENT T031
Okay.  Well thank you.

DOCTOR T031
Let me walk you out.

PATIENT T031
Thank you doc.

DOCTOR T031
No problem.  Alright take care.  You'll be hearing from me once I get the labs okay.

PATIENT T031
Thank you.

DOCTOR T031

PATIENT T031
