DOCTOR M637
A knee replacement?

PATIENT M637
Yeah they got to do that.  Uh I had a @@@ and all that.  I'm on pain pills man and they don't help no more.

DOCTOR M637
Has it changed in character or it's the same thing right?  Same location, same place?

PATIENT M637
Yeah.  Same, same location, and the only difference was pain just getting worse.  I had to talk to the Rheumatology I mean they do @@@ about a month ago and they didn’t do anything you know so I always see Orthopedic myself and they say.  I only see those guys you know time and time and I'm constantly telling them and they doing nothing.

DOCTOR M637
Yeah.

PATIENT M637
I go to see the Orthopedics and they say hey you know, that's the only thing going on.  They're gonna ease the pain.  They didn't give me any painkiller either.  They don’t help.

DOCTOR M637
Okay.

PATIENT M637
I uh, you know I had this pain in the lung you know, uh so they supposed to do a biopsy uh then they cancelled it, this is the second time they cancelled it.  I was supposed to go on the 16th and they didn't do it now.

DOCTOR M637
A biopsy of what?

PATIENT M637
Yeah uh now they tell me on the 23rd.

DOCTOR M637
Okay, what do they want, what are they doing a biopsy on?

PATIENT M637
For the lung, uh @@@.

DOCTOR M637
Oh for the nodule in there right?

PATIENT M637
Yeah only on the right @@@.

DOCTOR M637
Did they find this on the CT?  They were going to biopsy it, really?

PATIENT M637
Yeah, well they was supposed to, well that's what they told me and they cancelled uh twice and they said they didn't have room so now they set it for the 23rd.

DOCTOR M637
Okay.

PATIENT M637
I still got that pain in there though.

DOCTOR M637
It hurts with breathing?

PATIENT M637
Yeah when I cough you know.

DOCTOR M637
And that hasn't changed at all either?

PATIENT M637
No it ain't changed you know it’s, I just, I can hold off on coughing.  If I have to cough it pains me.  And in Rheumatology he ordered it long ago, I mean when they got it in the pulmonary @@@ ordered it and they said they didn't have room or whatever yeah.

DOCTOR M637
So you're supposed to go this month again?

PATIENT M637
Yeah.

DOCTOR M637
On the 16th.

PATIENT M637
I was supposed to go the 16th.

DOCTOR M637
Yeah.

PATIENT M637
Uh when he cancelled it he said they didn't have room so now they move it to the 23rd.

DOCTOR M637
Okay.  Yeah that's probably something they're gonna take care of for you just ahead but they've got to figure out what that is.

PATIENT M637
Yeah well if they say I need it, I mean the doctor @@@ he don't know what to do until he get this biopsy and this is the second time he cancelled it.  So I'm gonna see him on the 18th so I could tell him what happened.  They didn't do it.

DOCTOR M637
Sorry I'm putting in some notes here.  So you're gonna see the lung doctors on the 18th?

PATIENT M637
Huh?

DOCTOR M637
You see the lung doctor on the 18th and then the radiologist who's supposed to do the biopsy?

PATIENT M637
Yeah, right, right.  I was supposed to do it on the 16th, now they called me and said they only, you know, they're filled up so they moved to the 23rd but I see this doctor on the 18th.  So better check it.

DOCTOR M637
I think you're gonna have the biopsy that day.  So you'll have to follow it up I guess.

PATIENT M637
Yeah well he said he don't know what's going on, when he get that.

DOCTOR M637
Yeah cause they may want to look at the tissue and see.

PATIENT M637
Right, right.

DOCTOR M637
Because it’s guessing otherwise.

PATIENT M637
Yeah right.

DOCTOR M637
So, what do you taking for your pain?

PATIENT M637
Uh they gave me this, I got Tylenol 3 codeine and it don't help.

DOCTOR M637
Okay.

PATIENT M637
But I'll tell you.

DOCTOR M637
I mean we can, we can do other stuff too, or you can go higher than that. That’s not the strongest that we got.  The question is have you ever had a bad reaction with like Vicodin or anything like that?

PATIENT M637
Well I had some Vicodin, but I had it and it didn't do anything.

DOCTOR M637
Didn't do anything.

PATIENT M637
No it didn't do anything uh this Tylenol 3, I want to say it helps a little bit.  But I had the Vicodin in its place and it didn't do nothing.  The doctor over there tell me that the only thing gonna ease the pain, you know the @@@.

DOCTOR M637
Is the hip replacement?

PATIENT M637
Yeah I mean we definitely @@@.

DOCTOR M637
And we can't do that until we figure out what's going on with the lung.

PATIENT M637
Right so this lung problem is a whole other thing.

DOCTOR M637
@@@ sorry.  Give me one second, I'll be right back.

PATIENT M637
So this problem is holding up everything.

DOCTOR M637
Uh-huh. 

PATIENT M637
See all of this, they always inform me when the appointment is, I mean they are and they said they didn't do it so this is the second time that they moved it up.

DOCTOR M637
Yeah.

PATIENT M637
Now I thought, when I see him on the 18th and he still want @@@ what I mean.

DOCTOR M637
Let me call and ask about that. The radiology.  They still have you listed for the 16th.

PATIENT M637
I know but well they cancelled it doctor.

DOCTOR M637
Yeah you know I would call them and ask them why.

PATIENT M637
Yes.  Why.

DOCTOR M637
And maybe they can just switch you back.  Um.

PATIENT M637
Yeah because.

DOCTOR M637
I’m just going to call.

PATIENT M637
Well I need to get this here.

DOCTOR M637
Yeah I know.  That's holding everything up so.

PATIENT M637
That holding up.

DOCTOR M637
See what we can do here.

PATIENT M637
Well I'm telling you they called me and said the 23rd which is next Monday instead of this Monday.

DOCTOR M637
Oh September 23rd or August 23rd, just an extra couple weeks.

PATIENT M637
Yeah, August the 23rd.

DOCTOR M637
But they still moved you so okay.  See what's holding it up.

(Doctor calls Radiology)

DOCTOR M637
Alright so the scanner.

PATIENT M637
Now this uh.

DOCTOR M637
You need a refill?

PATIENT M637
No uh well I just got this but uh, I'm having all kinds of problems with this uh it really, every time I come here well my blood pressure's up and I @@@ senior citizens and it still up.  Now I tell you doctor uh, like at the @@@ they be on me for years.

DOCTOR M637
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M637
So they discontinued and then they come up with this drug and then well I had one before this and it didn't do anything at all so now when it has this, it ain't doing anything, it ain't been helping a lot.

DOCTOR M637
Do you feel bad when you're taking it?

PATIENT M637
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR M637
Your blood pressure's great.

PATIENT M637
I was talking to the um, the Pharmacy in Walgreens and he said he never heard of it.

DOCTOR M637
What?  That's the most common drug for hypertension.

PATIENT M637
Yeah I don't know.

DOCTOR M637
But your blood pressure's really good okay.

PATIENT M637
Well I had just a little @@@ for a year on that, I've never had any problem and uh they @@@ so everybody trying to figure out what I need just so, but they need to come up with some stuff, I'm telling you this is something that really don't work at all.

DOCTOR M637

DOCTOR M637
The same thing you've been having?

PATIENT M637
Yeah, yeah I mean.  I mean you know I'm, nothing new.

DOCTOR M637
Nothing new.  It's all just about the same alright.

PATIENT M637
It's all the same.  The only thing wrong is getting worse.

DOCTOR M637
Yeah it's getting worse.  I talked to Radiology and the problem is they have to fix the CT scanner on that day or that week so there's actually no way you can get it done that week.  I know it's a pain in the ass but they should be ready, you got the appointment for the 23rd.

PATIENT M637
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR M637
Did you get the time?

PATIENT M637
Yeah I have it on the 23rd.

DOCTOR M637
You've got to make sure you just make that appointment.  So the Pulmonary people, call them and explain to them what's going on, tell them what you told me.  The thing is this issue is holding up everything it's all pain you're having in your hip and you can't have surgery until they figure out what's going on there okay.  (Doctor spoke with someone who came to the door)  I'm sorry.

DOCTOR M637
Alright you can have a seat we're done with this.  We've got to figure out something to at least get better with your pain while you're waiting getting everything done here.  You've tried tramadol right?

PATIENT M637

DOCTOR M637
Didn't do anything.

PATIENT M637

DOCTOR M637
And you tried Vicodin and that didn't do anything?

PATIENT M637
Huh?

DOCTOR M637

PATIENT M637
Yeah well you can help me; I mean it helped it some but that other stuff it don't help at all.

DOCTOR M637
Okay.

PATIENT M637
So I got the Tylenol 3 and I been using that so I take that.

DOCTOR M637
Alright uh.  Let's see.  I mean the only other thing we could go to is we could go to like morphine but I don't know if I want to do that though.

PATIENT M637
No.

DOCTOR M637
Will you be able to bear it out at least for a little longer if we give you more of your Tylenol 3, if we make sure you have enough of a constant supply of Tylenol 3?
