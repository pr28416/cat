DOCTOR S846
How's it going?  I'm DOCTOR.  You got your reports?

PATIENT S846
Yeah shall we take a look at the EKG?

DOCTOR S846
When did you get an EKG?

PATIENT S846
Uh three weeks ago.

DOCTOR S846
Why'd you get an EKG?  Did I order that or?

PATIENT S846
Uh no another doctor ordered it uh.  I had uh; well I had a period of shortness of breath.  I'm on the Agent Orange Registry and I said I'd better get an EKG to check for ischemia cause I know that came up on me.

DOCTOR S846
You're on the what registry?

PATIENT S846
The Agent Orange Registry.

DOCTOR S846
Oh okay.

PATIENT S846
And that's a result, I was exposed to it.  I said we better check that and that EKG showed ischemia and it was very irregular and we kind of.

DOCTOR S846
Do you have chest pain?

PATIENT S846
Uh no but I know I get dizzy once in a while.  That could be from the blood pressure going up sometimes.  I got, see when I first started coming here my pressure was way up, now you got it under control but uh I been.

DOCTOR S846
So you got the chest x-rays because you're short of breath?

PATIENT S846
Uh the EKG?

DOCTOR S846
Yeah EKG.

PATIENT S846
Yeah I was concerned because it came up on me @@@ before the Agent Orange.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.

PATIENT S846
And it came up on the registry and pluls I have high blood pressure so you know.

DOCTOR S846
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S846
From Vietnam so I was a little concerned about that so we said we better get an EKG.

DOCTOR S846
And what symptoms were you having?  You were feeling short of breath when you walked or just when you were resting?

PATIENT S846
Uh when I walk.

DOCTOR S846
When you walk and how long had that been going on?

PATIENT S846
Uh it's just off and on.

DOCTOR S846
How many blocks can you walk before you get short of breath or how many flights of stairs can you walk before you get short of breath?

PATIENT S846
Uh I can maybe go at least a flight.

DOCTOR S846
Is that new or old?  Has that always been the case for a while or is that like that's been here less than a week?

PATIENT S846
No it's been like this for quite a while.

DOCTOR S846
Quite a while of years?

PATIENT S846
Years. Since Vietnam.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.  So your shortness of breath when you exert yourself is not new wouldn't you say?

PATIENT S846
No, no it's not @@@.

DOCTOR S846
So uh what did it get worst that made you say or did you just see the registry and like hey I better get my.

PATIENT S846
Oh yeah, that's basically what I did, yeah that's why I started taking a look.

DOCTOR S846
So I'm taking a look at it now.  Let me just print it out, let's see here.

PATIENT S846
And I talked to the nurse.  She said it's probably the dizziness.  I need to quit smoking.  I've tried to quit smoking 20 times and the problem when I smoke it runs my pressure up and that probably what makes me dizzy once in a while so.  It's not all the time.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah I.

PATIENT S846
So I got to quit smoking I know that.

DOCTOR S846
The best thing you can do for yourself is to quit smoking.

PATIENT S846
Yeah.

DOCTOR S846
How are you doing at that?

PATIENT S846
I cut it down.

DOCTOR S846
Well you were up to a pack a day the last time I saw you.

PATIENT S846
Yeah I'm at a half now.

DOCTOR S846
At half pack a day.

PATIENT S846
Yeah and if I could get it.

DOCTOR S846
You go to the Smoking Cessation Clinic?  They can help.

PATIENT S846
Yeah I'm trying to do it on my own.

DOCTOR S846
Trying to do it on your own?

PATIENT S846
Yeah.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.

PATIENT S846
If it don't work then I'll go to the clinic.

DOCTOR S846
Cause on Monday you don't need an appointment you just walked in.

PATIENT S846
You mean right here?

DOCTOR S846
Yeah no appointment.

PATIENT S846
Well I.

DOCTOR S846
Do you want me to give you the information to you?

PATIENT S846
Yeah, yeah I'll come up.

DOCTOR S846
You walk in, you don't need an appointment there’s one on Monday they'll give you gums, patches.

PATIENT S846
Yeah.

DOCTOR S846
And the other one on Wednesdays is more like a group thing, kind of like working through a group thing but you can't get any of the gums or patches on that one.

PATIENT S846
But I can just walk in on Monday?

DOCTOR S846
You can just walk in.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.

PATIENT S846
Yeah.

DOCTOR S846
Let me give you the information.

PATIENT S846
I've cut it down but I need to quit.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah that would definitely be the best thing you can do for your health.

PATIENT S846
Yeah.

DOCTOR S846
Is to prevent cancer, you get lung cancer you know with smoking.  You increase your chances like 10 times and you can increase your chance of getting a heart attack or a stroke by multiple times by smoking so a lot of risk factors with the smoking definitely uh, you know.

PATIENT S846
Now I have the ischemia what was my concern, my family that cuts 
down on you, that means you're not getting oxygen to some part of your heart.  @@@.

DOCTOR S846
Ischemia just means like a heart attack.  In medical terms they call it a myocardial ischemia.

PATIENT S846
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S846
That just means you know the heart's not getting oxygen like you said.

PATIENT S846
Right.

DOCTOR S846
When your tissues don't get oxygen they start dying.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
So when your heart muscle starts dying, okay that's what we call a heart attack and obviously.

PATIENT S846
You’re at risk.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.  So you get a lot of other problems besides that and the heart can sometimes recover but it can never recover fully and that's when people get what we call congestive heart failure with the heart not pumping as much as it can and they get you know a lot more deconditioned and they can't you know you may know people who can walk from this end of the room to that end of the room without ever getting short of breath.

PATIENT S846
Yeah. I’m not like that.

DOCTOR S846
You know they're probably not able so that's what I'm saying like that's what happens.

PATIENT S846
Can I, can I improve on that maybe by a treadmill or something like that?  Would that help it?

DOCTOR S846
Diet, exercise, weight loss, cutting out smoking, controlling your blood pressure all those things will prevent.  These have all been studied, widely studied right and they look at people and they say what we should do, what can we do to prevent heart attacks and the thing they found is you know controlling your blood pressure.

PATIENT S846
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S846
Have your pressure in good control.

PATIENT S846
Yeah.  Quit smoking.  I got to quit smoking.

DOCTOR S846
You know controlling your cholesterol, cause cholesterol can cause heart attacks.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.  Quitting smoking okay.  Age, you can't change that.  Genetics, you can't change that.

PATIENT S846
But how can Agent Orange cause that?

DOCTOR S846
Agent Orange?

PATIENT S846
Yeah.

DOCTOR S846
Uh.

PATIENT S846
They told me that's related?

DOCTOR S846
Uh I don't know, I actually have to look into Agent Orange, I'm not an expert on Agent Orange.

PATIENT S846
Okay.  I'm know I'm on the registry.

DOCTOR S846
But Agent Orange, so I know there are some lung uh and there's some uh.

PATIENT S846
They said high blood pressure.

DOCTOR S846
There's some cancers that can be related to Agent Orange.

PATIENT S846
Yeah.

DOCTOR S846
Uh lymphomas.

PATIENT S846
Yeah right.  See I'm on the registry and there was a letter saying that ischemia came up on the list as one of them.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah, on the list as one of them okay.

PATIENT S846
And I just figured, how could they know that caused it?

DOCTOR S846
So the Urology Clinic people they're following your PSAs?

PATIENT S846
Yeah.

DOCTOR S846
Oh you saw them in March.

PATIENT S846
Yes he's following that.

DOCTOR S846
And we'll work on that.  How's the, your blood pressure medicines you're still taking all of them?

PATIENT S846
I been taking all of them.  Uh they told me if I could start working out maybe we can eliminate one but right now I'm taking all of them.  But it's keeping my pressure down.

DOCTOR S846
You're taking metoprolol and you're taking the hydrochlorothiazide and Losartan all those pills?

PATIENT S846
Right, yes.

DOCTOR S846
And you're taking the amlodipine?

PATIENT S846
Yes.

DOCTOR S846
Alright um yes and then you remember a low salt diet cause a low salt diet will help prevent you know, you from getting high blood pressure as well.  Um.

PATIENT S846
Eating a lot of seafood now.

DOCTOR S846
How's your mood been doing?  Do you still follow with the psychiatrist and everything?

PATIENT S846
Yeah my PTSD is getting worse.  I haven't worked in eight months.  

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.

PATIENT S846
Uh I'm under a lot of stress and like I said when I heard about this ischemia with my heart it made me worse cause you know I hadn't been sleeping but the doctor did give me some, I got some, I came in and got some pills for the stress.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.

PATIENT S846
I get too, a little bit too upset but uh that's why I'm trying to work on everything.  I mean I'm on the internet and you know my family's working with me.

DOCTOR S846
No chest pain, no pressure, no palpitations um?

PATIENT S846
No.

DOCTOR S846
And no shortness of breath at rest and you have a little bit of dyspnea on the, a little bit of shortness of breath when you move.

PATIENT S846
When I exert myself.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah okay.

PATIENT S846
I think maybe that's from not being, not working out.

DOCTOR S846
Any of those night sweats any more or fevers or chills at night?

PATIENT S846
I still get night sweats.

DOCTOR S846
You still get night sweats?

PATIENT S846
Yes.

DOCTOR S846
And it is, uh how long have you had your night sweats for?

PATIENT S846
Since Vietnam.  I wake up.

DOCTOR S846
Vietnam.

PATIENT S846
I sleep maybe two hours then I can't sleep.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.  I know we had tried a new sleep aid on yo,u right.  Didn't Psychiatry give you a new prescription?

PATIENT S846
I tried that.

DOCTOR S846
Is that helping or not helping anymore?

PATIENT S846
It did help because uh.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.

PATIENT S846
Before I was trying to drink beer to go to sleep.  I don't like alcohol.

DOCTOR S846
You're not drinking anymore, right?

PATIENT S846
Oh no, no.

DOCTOR S846
Good.

PATIENT S846
The pills eliminated that so.

DOCTOR S846
Good.

PATIENT S846
It helps.

DOCTOR S846
Alright.  So you're still getting the night sweats a little bit.

PATIENT S846
Oh yes.

DOCTOR S846
But you think it may be related to PTSD?

PATIENT S846
I know it is.

DOCTOR S846
Okay we sent a bunch of tests off.  Those were all negative.  Just to let you know the hepatitis B, C, thyroid and it was normal.  Your blood tests look good.

PATIENT S846
Great.

DOCTOR S846
And that's all you know good news.

PATIENT S846
And those sweats all from PTSD yeah.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.

PATIENT S846
That's something I'm have to live with.

DOCTOR S846
You get any chest pain when you exert yourself or just the shortness of breath?

PATIENT S846
Just a little shortness of breath that's all.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.  And besides having this do you ever pass out?

PATIENT S846
No, no, no.  I just get a little dizzy. 

DOCTOR S846
You know is it dizzy when you stand up, like is it positional or is it even if you're laying in bed you can get this dizziness.

PATIENT S846
Uh usually standing up.

DOCTOR S846
When you're standing up.

PATIENT S846
Uh yeah you know what it is like see, when I was in the Marine Corps.

DOCTOR S846
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S846
If you smoke.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.

PATIENT S846
And during basic training I only smoked two cigarettes a day.

DOCTOR S846
Right.

PATIENT S846
Because by not smoking regular and stuff like that, you know when you smoke a cigarette you get dizzy.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.

PATIENT S846
That's what kind of dizziness I get.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.

PATIENT S846
So I say well maybe that's from smoking cigarettes.

DOCTOR S846
Maybe it’s from smoking cigarettes.

PATIENT S846
Yeah that's the same dizziness I got when I was in boot camp.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.

PATIENT S846
Cause I was only smoking two cigarettes a day.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.  @@@ deep breath in and out.  Again.  Good, again.  Good again.  Good again.  @@@.  Okay.  Do you need refills on medications today?

PATIENT S846
Uh no I think I'm okay right now.  So then the EKG, that's something I should be really concerned about?

DOCTOR S846
Yeah I'm gonna take a look at it.

PATIENT S846
Oh, oh you @@@.

DOCTOR S846
It's in the computer but it's easier to look at uh, easier to look at it on paper.

PATIENT S846
Yeah.  My wife thinks she’s a doc, she’s scared to death when she saw it.  I had a copy of it but I told her, let me talk to the doctor.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah I'm gonna take a look at it right now.

(DOCTOR OUT:  43:03  DOCTOR IN:  49:19)

DOCTOR S846
Let me get that for you.

PATIENT S846
Let me ask you something, does the high blood pressure make you sleepy all the time, a lot?

DOCTOR S846
No it shouldn't.

PATIENT S846
Cause I'm sitting up watching TV and a lot of times I get sleepy and my wife thought maybe it was the high blood pressure.

DOCTOR S846
Uh no.  Blood pressures, high blood pressures don't make you sleepy.

PATIENT S846
That's fine, it's probably.

DOCTOR S846
Sometimes medicines can do that.

PATIENT S846
It's from not sleeping at night.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.

PATIENT S846
Well that's been since Vietnam.

DOCTOR S846
Have a seat up here.  

(DOCTOR OUT:  49:51  DOCTOR IN: 60:32)

DOCTOR S846
Alright.  @@@ no appointment needed.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
You can just walk in any time between this time.

PATIENT S846
Good.

DOCTOR S846
Alright.

PATIENT S846
How'd that EKG look to you?

DOCTOR S846
Well the EKG you got, yeah so these waves right here that are upside, these are supposed to be pointing up.

PATIENT S846
The inverted P waves.

DOCTOR S846
The waves that are going up.

PATIENT S846
An inverted T wave right.

DOCTOR S846
Inverted T waves.

PATIENT S846
T wave, yeah Q, R, S and T yeah.

DOCTOR S846
If they're reading up or someone's been telling you?

PATIENT S846
My wife’s a respiratory therapist.

DOCTOR S846
Okay yeah.

PATIENT S846
And she say yeah it looks like ischemia but I said let me talk to the doctor.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah.  So you have inverted T waves.  These are nonspecific, it means that it's, you know if we could say wow this means that you have, that you're having a heart attack.  Right or something like that. This could mean that people would have had like prior, maybe some damage to the heart.

PATIENT S846
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S846
They will have it and other times people will be normal and they'll have this.

PATIENT S846
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay so it's not specific.  It's not necessarily but you do have some of those inverted T's here and then the fact that your, these waves are really high, they're indicate like hypertrophy, that the muscle of the.

PATIENT S846
It's called high blood pressure.

DOCTOR S846
Right, right.

PATIENT S846
Yeah QRS complex.

DOCTOR S846
Right exactly.

PATIENT S846
So maybe it was ischemic.

DOCTOR S846
Well it's not ischemic, this doesn't necessarily mean ischemia it just means that you have high blood pressure.

PATIENT S846
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.  This, these flipped T's mean that uh, you know it could mean ischemia, prior ischemia.

PATIENT S846
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.

PATIENT S846
Alright.

DOCTOR S846
The fact that these waves aren't really elevated means that you're not having like a heart attack like right now or something.

PATIENT S846
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S846
But this may or may not so I think the best thing to do would be, since you got the shortness of breath when you walked is just to do a stress test.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
A treadmill stress test.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
They put some things on your chest.

PATIENT S846
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S846
Stick these on the chest, you run on a treadmill or walk on a treadmill; under stress situation and they see if your heart has any ischemia.

PATIENT S846
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.

PATIENT S846
Alright.

DOCTOR S846
So we'll set that up.

PATIENT S846
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR S846
Right that's one.  The second have you ever been on cholesterol medicine?

PATIENT S846
No.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.  So, are you fasting today or did you eat?

PATIENT S846
I haven't eaten anything that's why my stomach's growling.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.  Well I'm gonna lay out two options for you okay.  Let me show you something.  This is your cholesterol profile.  Okay this was in January of this year, this is what we got recently last time I saw you.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
This is what it was in 2008.  LDL, LDL cholesterol is the bad cholesterol.  We want as less of that as possible okay in our body.  You are 117, that's pretty good.  I mean a normal healthy person, a young healthy person we want 160 or less.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay and uh with someone with high blood pressure, as we get older we may be like the number 130 or less so you're still at that goal.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
But in January you were 176, it's fairly high.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
For a guy that, your risk factor for heart attack are high blood pressure, your age and you're smoking.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay so those three risk factors if you put it into a calculator and with your cholesterol profile puts you at risk of having a heart attack at about 25% in the next ten years.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.  So we want to lower that risk as much as possible okay.  So your goal by that calculator would be this goal should be less than 100.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
But you're above on that okay.  Your HDL that's the good cholesterol okay.  We want that at least 45 or above in males.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
So you're good there.  You have enough of the good cholesterol.  Triglycerides are okay.  Your total cholesterol number is high as well.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay which is probably reflective of that as well.  So this number is pretty high.

PATIENT S846
So I got to get that LDL down uh.

DOCTOR S846
You get the LDL down so, this one is, we could either since this number was so good and this was in 2008, I'm going to lay out the option we could either A recheck it.

PATIENT S846
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S846
And then based on what that shows we'd start you on a cholesterol medicine or we just go ahead and bite the bullet and start the cholesterol medicine today.

PATIENT S846
I would rather maybe recheck it because we cut down on a lot of the fatty; we eat a lot of fish now.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.

PATIENT S846
So uh I'd rather recheck it.  @@@.

DOCTOR S846
With diet and exercise, if you optimize the diet, you can lower this by about, they say about 15%.

PATIENT S846
Without medications.

DOCTOR S846
Without medications.

PATIENT S846
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR S846
Okay so you know.  If you lower this that 15%, you know you take 15% off of this, that still wouldn't take you at the goal of 100 or less.

PATIENT S846
Right.

DOCTOR S846
I just want you to understand that.

PATIENT S846
Right.

DOCTOR S846
Now if you do optimizing nutrition in your diet, I don't want you and this gets lower I don't want you and we still start you on cholesterol medicine I don't want that to discourage you or do all this work and it meant nothing.

PATIENT S846
Yeah.

DOCTOR S846
Right that's not true because you won't need that high of a dose of the medicine A or as you continue to exercise or if you cut out your smoking, you know your other risk factors may go away.  Smoking is a big one that you could change.  

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Your age you probably can't change right.

PATIENT S846
Right.

DOCTOR S846
You can't do anything about your age and you have to change the fact that you have high blood pressure.

PATIENT S846
Right.

DOCTOR S846
We can control it, we can't change the fact that you have it okay, we can’t change the fact that you had it, but you can change the fact that you smoke and that will change your risk okay.

PATIENT S846
Yeah I'd rather see if I can get that LDL down and have it rechecked.

DOCTOR S846
So you haven’t, you haven't ate today so would you like to have it rechecked today?

PATIENT S846
Uh I'd rather do it on the next visit cause I'd like to try to do something to get it down.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.

PATIENT S846
Uh if possible because you know that's a big jump from 117 to 176.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah it is a big.

PATIENT S846
@@@?

DOCTOR S846
Yeah this was in September of 08 you know.

PATIENT S846
Yeah it could've been the diet, you know if you ask me.

DOCTOR S846
I don't know if you were fasting that day either.  That shouldn't throw things off too much because if you were eating and it was real high because you're eating your triglycerides would have been high so I don't think, I think these are fairly accurate measurements.

PATIENT S846
Oh wait a minute, you know why it's up, my weight's gone up 20 pounds.  See I normally keep it at a constant weight.  I'm 20 pounds higher, I'm normally 165.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah and you're 180, you're 185.

PATIENT S846
Yeah right, right so.

DOCTOR S846
So.

PATIENT S846
It's this extra weight.

DOCTOR S846
Would you like, let me tell you this.

PATIENT S846
Yeah.

DOCTOR S846
So do you want us to hold off on starting the medicine or would you like to start a low dose of the cholesterol medicine, do your diet and exercise.

PATIENT S846
What are the side effects?

DOCTOR S846
Side effects of the cholesterol medicines it's generally a safe medicine.  You can get some muscle pain with it.

PATIENT S846
Oh, that no problem.

DOCTOR S846
You can get some muscle pain with it.  If you get muscle pain with it you stop it and you come back and tell us.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
But that's the major side effect.

PATIENT S846
Oh okay, yeah a low dose maybe.

DOCTOR S846
You want to try a low dose?

PATIENT S846
Yes I would like to try it.

DOCTOR S846
We'll start a low dose.

PATIENT S846
Okay yeah I was worried about side effects.

DOCTOR S846
I want you to still do the diet and exercise and I want you to lose those extra pounds.

PATIENT S846
Yeah.  I mean.

DOCTOR S846
That way when we check it in six months your cholesterol may be at the goal we want it and we could maybe.

PATIENT S846
Take me off it?

DOCTOR S846
Exactly.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Alright.

PATIENT S846
Yeah I am 20 pounds over my weight so.

DOCTOR S846
Yeah and you're not going to be able to lose that weight overnight.  You know it's going to take some time so maybe the cholesterol medicine might be a good thing to start you with okay.

PATIENT S846
Uh-huh.  Yeah cause I mean if it was low, I was 20 pounds lighter so then I gained this weight and the cholesterol goes up.  That's got to be it.

DOCTOR S846
You want to pick it up today or do you want it sent to you?

PATIENT S846
Uh they can send it to me.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.  So take this medicine at night okay?

PATIENT S846
Okay.  Just one time a night.

DOCTOR S846
One time a night.  The reason why we have it at night cause actually your cholesterol level goes high at night.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay while you're sleeping.  It's the natural cycle of the body so when you take it in the evening dose.  Okay it's going to give you instructions like it's a 20 mg tablet and the instructions are to break it in half so I only started you on a low dose, 10 mg okay.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Um.

PATIENT S846
So I just take one half each night.

DOCTOR S846
Each night.

PATIENT S846
Okay.

DOCTOR S846
Okay.  I renewed your other blood pressure medicines which isn't a problem alright.  You're going to try to quit smoking and I'll give you the information on that.

PATIENT S846
Right.

DOCTOR S846
And uh let me order the stress test.  Now they're gonna send you out a letter telling you when to come in for the stress test okay.

PATIENT S846
Okay no problem.

DOCTOR S846
Um and you may need to stop your uh, just hold your metoprolol.

PATIENT S846
