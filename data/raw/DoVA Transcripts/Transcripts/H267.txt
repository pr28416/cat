DOCTOR H267
Good how are you?  Fair enough.  @@@.

PATIENT H267

DOCTOR H267
How are you doing?

PATIENT H267
Oh pretty good I think.

SECOND PERSON H267
How are you today?

DOCTOR H267
Uh I'm actually doing pretty good myself.  Getting kind of tired but.

SECOND PERSON H267
Yeah.

PATIENT H267
I think I'm pretty good cause I'm still breathing.

DOCTOR H267
I saw that you saw the Hematology doctors.

PATIENT H267
The what?

DOCTOR H267
The doctors about your blood.

PATIENT H267
Yeah I saw them.  I just had the blood drawn today.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah I already checked, it wasn’t back.

PATIENT H267
Yeah I just had it.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah.

PATIENT H267
I just had it drawn uh about 12:30.

DOCTOR H267
About 12:30 so it probably won't come back till a little bit later.  Right and how have your blood sugars been at home?

PATIENT H267
Blood sugar, it was 137 today, it's been pretty good.

DOCTOR H267
So you're checking every day?

PATIENT H267
Yes.

DOCTOR H267
What time do you check it?

PATIENT H267
Uh this morning.  You got uh, I wake up late.

DOCTOR H267
Okay.  I'm just going to be typing as we talk okay.

PATIENT H267
Okay I wake up late so it varies because I stay up late.  Uh most of the time it'd be around 2 o'clock when I take it.

DOCTOR H267
Is this after you've eaten something?

PATIENT H267
Uh only coffee.

DOCTOR H267
So only after coffee?

PATIENT H267
Right uh-huh, after I've had my cup of coffee.

DOCTOR H267
Do you have any low sugars?

PATIENT H267
No it's never low.

DOCTOR H267
What's it range from?

PATIENT H267
It ranges between 100 and sometimes it'll get up around 190.

DOCTOR H267
Okay that's the highest it goes?

PATIENT H267
Yeah that's about as high as it goes.

DOCTOR H267
Okay because you're hemoglobin A1c which is the measure of how tightly controlled your blood sugars are, when we checked it the last time it was a little bit elevated.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
So uh I think we're gonna have to probably go up on your medicine.

PATIENT H267
Again?

DOCTOR H267
Yeah because well let's see, so I saw you back in February, oh no you know because I think I had seen you back in October.

PATIENT H267
I seen a letter about the.

DOCTOR H267
You saw DOCTOR.

PATIENT H267
I saw DOCTOR then I saw someone else too.

DOCTOR H267
The blood doctor right?

PATIENT H267
Right and I saw them yeah.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah so we had cut back on it but we need to go up on it.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
Um back in October.

PATIENT H267
Yeah.

DOCTOR H267
And you're on 40 units right?

PATIENT H267
Right that's the same amount I'm taking now, 40.

DOCTOR H267
We can actually go up to 45.

PATIENT H267
Uh no.

DOCTOR H267
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H267
But okay.

DOCTOR H267
How do you feel about that?

PATIENT H267
Well if you think its necessary I mean.

DOCTOR H267
The only thing is as long as your blood sugars aren't running low.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
On either number.

PATIENT H267
They're never running low.

DOCTOR H267
Never lower than 100?

PATIENT H267
The only time is if I miss a meal, then I might run low.

DOCTOR H267
Okay.

PATIENT H267
But generally they never run low.

DOCTOR H267
Alright.

PATIENT H267
Okay.

DOCTOR H267
So if that's the case then we'll go up a little bit more.

PATIENT H267
Okay.  I was thinking all along, she’s probably going to raise it.

DOCTOR H267
I know.

PATIENT H267
@@@.

SECOND PERSON H267
He was just high.

DOCTOR H267
So you know we want the goal of your A1c below 7.  Yours is 8.3.

SECOND PERSON H267
That's the same as was back then.

PATIENT H267
I thought, well what was it last time?

DOCTOR H267
Before it was actually better, it was 7. something.

PATIENT H267
It was 7 @@@.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah.  Now it will happen, it could be that your eating habits have changed but elevated or not @@@ little bit more insulin.

PATIENT H267
But it could be so if I'm not getting along as well since it's been cold.

DOCTOR H267
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H267
And when it's cold my hip is bothering me and I don't move as much as when it's warm.

DOCTOR H267
So why don't we go up by 5 units.  If you start getting anything below 100.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
Then you just cut it down to just say 43 units.

PATIENT H267
Oh okay.

DOCTOR H267
Okay.

PATIENT H267
Right.

DOCTOR H267
Uh but keep it in the 40s and then if, like I said, if you do it at 45, if you suddenly have lower readings below 100.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
Then cut it back down so it would be 43 units.  If you're still getting low readings then cut it down to 40.

PATIENT H267
Oh okay.

DOCTOR H267
Okay.

PATIENT H267
Yeah, I just have to bring it back down if it's low, I get it okay.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah.

PATIENT H267
Right, okay.

DOCTOR H267
And um this.

PATIENT H267
There's something I need to see, it's one of the things I need you to see.

DOCTOR H267
Oh okay.

PATIENT H267
They wanted me to see @@@ doctor.  It's about my vitamin D.

DOCTOR H267
Oh you're vitamin D levels?

PATIENT H267
Right.

DOCTOR H267
Let's see.  Yeah so this is actually pretty low.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
And we can actually; we can probably set you up for a supplementation for your vitamin D.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
And it's one pill that you'll take every week.

PATIENT H267
It's once a day?

DOCTOR H267
It's once a week.

PATIENT H267
Oh okay.

DOCTOR H267
And you'll take it for about you know a few months.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
And then we'll recheck your levels.

PATIENT H267
Okay.

DOCTOR H267
Okay, let me see.  Oh this is from last year.

PATIENT H267
Right.

DOCTOR H267
Do you take any vitamin D supplements were you given anything?

PATIENT H267
No they didn't give me anything.  They placed me on that, I know the last time I was in, they forgot to give it to me, DOCTOR when I saw DOCTOR and uh but I told him that I was going to go back on it so to get it for me.

DOCTOR H267
Okay, well yeah last time you didn't get started taking anything so it's probably still low.

PATIENT H267
Right and tell me what does that vitamin D do?

DOCTOR H267
Well it actually helps; the higher your vitamin D is the better it is for your bones.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
And uh the lower your vitamin D, you are at an increased risk of when you fall of having your bones break.

PATIENT H267
Right.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah so.

PATIENT H267
I don’t want that.  Then let's um.

DOCTOR H267
And how's your breathing been?

PATIENT H267
Breathing is about the same. 

DOCTOR H267
About the same.

PATIENT H267
It's still bad.  I get out of breath easily.

DOCTOR H267
So you haven't been using the CPAP?

PATIENT H267
The CPAP, what is that?

DOCTOR H267
The CPAP do you use that?

PATIENT H267
If you mean the breathing machine?

DOCTOR H267
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H267
I don't have a breathing machine; I have a sleep apnea machine.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah that's what I meant by it.

PATIENT H267
Hmm.

DOCTOR H267
Do you use it?

PATIENT H267
Hmm sometimes, not like I should.

DOCTOR H267
How come?

PATIENT H267
It's uncomfortable, I'm scared of it.

DOCTOR H267
You could maybe try to get it re-fitted.

PATIENT H267
Okay.

DOCTOR H267
So maybe that's why it's, because it's uncomfortable for you.

PATIENT H267
Hmm, we tried uh you know the stick in your nose.

DOCTOR H267
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H267
Tried that and then we tried the mask and it still.

DOCTOR H267
Still uncomfortable.

PATIENT H267
Still uncomfortable.  I'm going to, what I'm gonna do is start using it regularly and uh see how if I can get used to it.  If I can just get used to it being on my face.  I'm not used to anything covering my nose and face so I'm gonna try it and see how that works.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H267
Um, is it true that they had found something new uh that you don't have to use the mask?

DOCTOR H267
For the CPAP?

SECOND PERSON H267
Uh for the CPAP treatment.

DOCTOR H267
No, do you know what um.

SECOND PERSON H267
Somewhere I saw or heard about it on the TV or something.  It's a medication I think instead of the machine.

DOCTOR H267
Hmm for sleep apnea, not that I know of.

SECOND PERSON H267
Well maybe it's not, maybe it's new.

DOCTOR H267
Because you know the reason why the medication is not @@@.  So I don't know, I don't think there's any medications that actually change this – change that.  @@@.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON H267
Well you, it's probably not just kind of pills, sometimes he gets aggravated with me because I wake him up.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah.  And the other problem is the longer you don't use the CPAP the higher your risk of developing high blood pressure of the arteries of your lungs.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
And that can be very dangerous.

PATIENT H267
Yes.

DOCTOR H267
Uh and that's why it's really important for you to.

PATIENT H267
To use that machine.

SECOND PERSON H267
So what do you mean about high blood pressure from the arteries of your lungs?

DOCTOR H267
Uh you can, just probably over time and you develop what's called pulmonary hypertension.

SECOND PERSON H267
Oh.

DOCTOR H267
And that uh.

PATIENT H267
What you say, that means what?

DOCTOR H267
Like how you have high blood pressure of, we give medication for, for your arteries.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh @@@.

DOCTOR H267
No you can actually get that of the blood vessels of your lungs, uh the blood vessels of your heart that kind of leads to your lungs.

PATIENT H267
Oh okay.

DOCTOR H267
And um and that's much harder to treat.

PATIENT H267
Oh okay.

SECOND PERSON H267
But it is treatable?

DOCTOR H267
Well not really.

SECOND PERSON H267
Not successfully?

DOCTOR H267
Uh sometimes if the pressure gets so high you can be on home oxygen.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh @@@.

SECOND PERSON H267
What is a really dangerous blood pressure?

DOCTOR H267
Uh for the lungs?

SECOND PERSON H267
For anything.

DOCTOR H267
Well I mean, usually our goal blood pressures for you, when you come in here and we want your blood pressure to be about 130/80.

PATIENT H267
Hmm.  Well today my blood pressure was 112/73.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah actually that's good.

PATIENT H267
So I could take off, stay on my blood pressure medicines?

DOCTOR H267
Yeah that's actually great; it's good that you should stay there.

PATIENT H267
Oh okay, alright.  Cause I thought it was too low.

DOCTOR H267
No it's actually normal.  Less than 120/80 is normal.

PATIENT H267
Oh is that, okay.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah so.  Um do you need any refills today?

PATIENT H267
Yes I do.  I need refills on um uh all of my uh, like the insulin, the insulin uh the syringes I don't have any refills on the syringes and my testing strips.

DOCTOR H267
Okay.

SECOND PERSON H267
Nothing else?

PATIENT H267
Yeah I have a one more and my uh I need a refill on the Cialis.

DOCTOR H267
Okay.  Anything else?

PATIENT H267
That's all.  Cause I have refills on the rest of them.  DOCTOR gave me refills on most of them the last time.

SECOND PERSON H267
Last time you were here?

PATIENT H267
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H267
Okay.

DOCTOR H267
So do you want to get those, pick them up while you're here?

PATIENT H267
Uh you can have them mailed to me.

DOCTOR H267
Mailed to you.

PATIENT H267
Cause I have enough to last me for a couple of weeks.

DOCTOR H267
Okay.  Let me have you sit down so we can listen to you.

PATIENT H267
Do you need me to take my coat off?

DOCTOR H267
Yes.

PATIENT H267
Okay.  Oh you know something else, I almost forgot, my um my right leg it keeps swelling up.

DOCTOR H267
When?

PATIENT H267
Oh this last week it swelled up, it's about every day.  I don't know if something's cutting off my circulation or what.

DOCTOR H267
So do you have any pain when you walk?

PATIENT H267
Yes I do.

DOCTOR H267
In your legs?

PATIENT H267
Yes uh, I contribute that to -  you know I need a hip replacement and I don't want to do that but the swelling, that shouldn't cause the swelling though right?

DOCTOR H267
So, do you try putting your feet up?  Have you been on your feet a lot?

PATIENT H267
Well I'm not on it a whole lot but uh.

DOCTOR H267
I'm gonna have you um roll up your pants.

PATIENT H267
See I think uh it's swelled right now.

DOCTOR H267
So let me see the other one too.  And it kind of swells up then goes down?

PATIENT H267
It swells up and then it, both of them are swelling now.

SECOND PERSON H267
But I know your feet have swelled for the last.

PATIENT H267
Yeah the swelling in my leg.

SECOND PERSON H267
Your right leg.

PATIENT H267
Yeah it's mostly the right one.

SECOND PERSON H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
@@@.

PATIENT H267
@@@.

DOCTOR H267
I'll press it.  

SECOND PERSON H267
You want them both up?

DOCTOR H267
Yes and do you take a water pill at all?

PATIENT H267
Yes I take that for my blood pressure.  I think that's what blood.

SECOND PERSON H267
Yeah it's a water pill for your blood pressure.

PATIENT H267
She wants the sock off too?

SECOND PERSON H267
Do you want the sock off?

DOCTOR H267
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT H267
@@@ socks.

SECOND PERSON H267
It's swollen.

DOCTOR H267
And you didn't hurt yourself?

PATIENT H267
Not that I know of.  They just, I was watching TV.

DOCTOR H267
And how often do you get this?

PATIENT H267
Well, looks like all last week it's been swelling.

DOCTOR H267
And then the swelling goes down?

PATIENT H267
When I lay down and wake up it goes down.  But when I'm up and moving around it swells up.

DOCTOR H267
So one of the things that um.

SECOND PERSON H267
She wants this up.

DOCTOR H267
Is it right here?

PATIENT H267
Right in there, where you just had.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah.  And you didn't hurt yourself right?

PATIENT H267
No I don't remember.

SECOND PERSON H267
No.

PATIENT H267
No I don't feel any real pain in it.

DOCTOR H267
So why don't you, it this okay when I'm pressing?

PATIENT H267
It's okay.

DOCTOR H267
It's okay.

PATIENT H267
Right.

DOCTOR H267
Can you move your ankle for me, there's no pain there?

PATIENT H267
No it's, that's the way it was.

SECOND PERSON H267
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H267
I'm just thinking it had something to do with the circulation or something.

DOCTOR H267
Well you know I think they tested your circulation when you were in Podiatry.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
And the circulation of blood to your legs is okay.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
Uh.

PATIENT H267
But there's got to be something for it to swell up like that.  We'll let you know, next time it swell up maybe I take a picture of it and let you see.

SECOND PERSON H267
That one is swollen now.

PATIENT H267
Well this one is @@@.

DOCTOR H267
So it looks like your ankle here is swollen here.

SECOND PERSON H267
Okay.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
So.

PATIENT H267
I don't know.

DOCTOR H267
It could just because this is your bad hip right?

PATIENT H267
It is.

DOCTOR H267
So that you might actually be um using your, to compensate for your hip.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
You might be putting more pressure on your.

PATIENT H267
Yeah I do do that.

DOCTOR H267
On the joints and that would cause you swelling.  It's, I don't think it's anything to be worried about right now.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
But the thing is if it gets swollen and it stays swollen.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
And it becomes red and hot uh that's when we need to think about there's maybe clot in your leg or if you have an infection in your leg.

PATIENT H267
Alright.

DOCTOR H267
That doesn't seem to be the case.

PATIENT H267
Well then at night if I lay down, if I go to sleep when I wake up then it's down.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah that's another thing too is you could be putting a lot of pressure on that.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
But you're gonna naturally have a little bit more swelling.

PATIENT H267
Should I just, kind of keep @@@.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah.

PATIENT H267
@@@.

DOCTOR H267
Let me just listen to you okay.  

PATIENT H267
@@@.

SECOND PERSON H267
Okay.

PATIENT H267
Yeah.

DOCTOR H267
Deep breaths, another one.  Do you smoke?

PATIENT H267
Yes I do.

DOCTOR H267
Are you going to quit smoking soon?

PATIENT H267
Well I'm trying, I'm trying.

DOCTOR H267
Are you really trying?

PATIENT H267
Not real real hard uh.

DOCTOR H267
Because you've got some wheezing.

PATIENT H267
Hmm.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON H267
@@@.

DOCTOR H267
So you've got to stop smoking.

PATIENT H267
Right I know.

DOCTOR H267
Okay.  

PATIENT H267
I know all my doctors tell me.

SECOND PERSON H267
He's got to @@@ trying.

PATIENT H267
All of my doctors tell me.

SECOND PERSON H267
He's @@@.

DOCTOR H267
I just need to talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT H267
Oh okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  19:24  DOCTOR IN:  27:50)

DOCTOR H267
Okay.  So I talked to DOCTOR.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
And he actually recommends going up on your insulin to 50 units.

PATIENT H267
50?

DOCTOR H267
Yeah.  But you know cause it's up to you if you feel comfortable going up that many units.

PATIENT H267
Well if he thinks it's best I'll do it.

DOCTOR H267
And then if your blood sugars ever run low then you should.

PATIENT H267
Then cut back.

DOCTOR H267
Um cut back and then call here.

PATIENT H267
Okay.

DOCTOR H267
Okay and let him know.

PATIENT H267
Alright uh so a lot of times that if I call then I don't get through.

DOCTOR H267
I think sometimes they tell you to go to the Urgent Care.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
I don't know when DOCTOR is available here.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.  Yeah I know he's got a lot of patients.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah.

PATIENT H267
Oh.  So I it would probably be better just to call at his old clinic and ask for him?

DOCTOR H267
Yeah that's probably the best way.

PATIENT H267
Just call okay.  Uh one more thing I wanted to ask you and then uh you know a couple things, you send in for my syringes and stuff, you ordered those for me right?

DOCTOR H267
I'm going, yeah I'm actually ordering them right now.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
But we're going to have the come to you through the mail.

PATIENT H267

PATIENT H267

PATIENT H267
Because my granddaughter is going to school.

DOCTOR H267

PATIENT H267
And she needs somebody to keep her baby.

DOCTOR H267
Okay.

PATIENT H267
She had to miss today because I had to come, but I had to come, I need the supplies and stuff.

DOCTOR H267

DOCTOR H267
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H267
Uh if you were to tell me that uh I need, my activities were restricted to control my blood sugar what would you be telling me?

DOCTOR H267
What makes you think you uh restrict your activities?

PATIENT H267
I'm not under that?

DOCTOR H267
Uh uh.

PATIENT H267
No restrictions, I see.

DOCTOR H267
No you should actually try to walk around as much as you can.

PATIENT H267
Oh okay, that's what I was just @@@.

DOCTOR H267
Okay and this is the sheet you gave me earlier about the vitamin D levels.

SECOND PERSON H267
Well what about the shortness of his breath?

DOCTOR H267
So as much as you can tolerate.

SECOND PERSON H267
But um he gets out of breath quick.

DOCTOR H267
Yeah so the thing is that that we actually don't have any control over because part of it's his COPD.

SECOND PERSON H267

DOCTOR H267
Uh check his lungs for?

SECOND PERSON H267
You know @@@.

But there wasn't no need in going back until I quit smoking.

DOCTOR H267
So.

PATIENT H267
Cause she said basically is my problem is smoking.

DOCTOR H267
The problem is smoking.

PATIENT H267
Right.

And it's only gonna get worse.

PATIENT H267
Right.

DOCTOR H267
So what I recommend is for you to, I mean.

PATIENT H267
Right, I'm gonna stop smoking.

DOCTOR H267
Stop smoking, start using a breathing machine and then you're gonna start feeling much better.  You're gonna be able to walk further, you'll be less short of breath.

PATIENT H267
We have uh, once I quit smoking will my lungs clear up then or?

DOCTOR H267
It takes a, it'll take a while.  A lot damage has been done to your lungs.

PATIENT H267
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H267
Can't be reversed.

PATIENT H267
Right.

DOCTOR H267
But at least you won't damage it any further.
