DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Anybody around you been sick or anything else like that?

PATIENT J269
Pardon?

DOCTOR J269
Any sick contacts, anybody around you has been sick or?

PATIENT J269
No.

DOCTOR J269
Maybe it's just the shingles reactivation.

PATIENT J269
Yeah.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Ever had shingles anywhere else before?

PATIENT J269
No.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Uh any problems with vision in that eye?

PATIENT J269
Well no I can still see with it but it's painful.

DOCTOR J269
Very painful.  Does the light make it more painful?

PATIENT J269
Huh?

DOCTOR J269
Does the light hurt it?

PATIENT J269
Not really.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Anything else bothering you besides this?

PATIENT J269
No.

DOCTOR J269

PATIENT J269
No I'm on my own now.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Where do you live?

PATIENT J269
In my own home.  

DOCTOR J269
In Arlington Heights, is that where you're still living?

PATIENT J269
Arlington Heights.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Okay so.

PATIENT J269
What kind of pain medicine would you use for the shingles?

DOCTOR J269
Uh the same pain medication used for anything else really.  There's nothing specific for that.  You think you need pain medicine?

PATIENT J269
I don’t know, which ones can you give?

DOCTOR J269
Have you tried anything?

PATIENT J269
Yeah Tylenol but I've been @@@ all the time, all day yesterday, here in the hospital today I spent a long time.

DOCTOR J269
So your weight is up from where we last had it.  Last month.  It went from 188 to 195.

PATIENT J269
Hmm well I'm fluctuating around the 190 mark.

DOCTOR J269
You watching your diet with the salt and everything.

PATIENT J269
Oh sure.

DOCTOR J269
Okay and the fluids?

PATIENT J269
Yes.

DOCTOR J269
Any diarrhea coming back?

PATIENT J269
Uh, well it has nothing to do with C-Diff.  It's just regular diarrhea.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.

PATIENT J269
Yesterday and that's flared up but I, what is the stuff they use for diarrhea when they have it, what's the medicine?  It's over-the-counter I think.

DOCTOR J269
Oh loperamide is the generic name but it's called, it's normally called Lomotil.  I think it was a brand name that you buy, Imodium, is that what you're talking about?

PATIENT J269
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.

DOCTOR J269
It’s dangerous to use if you're worried about C. diff.

PATIENT J269
What.

DOCTOR J269
That Imodium.

PATIENT J269
Oh.  I had C. diff four times this year.

DOCTOR J269
Yeah I know.  I would not recommend that medicine for you.

PATIENT J269
I wouldn't take it then.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Because what happens is, you get the toxins out, they build up and especially with the C. diff you have a very large increase in your colon where it gets bigger in size and they could explode and that's it perferates on that.

PATIENT J269
Okay.

DOCTOR J269
Well how's your activity levels?

PATIENT J269
Oh I try to move but I can barely move around I mean, I just sit.  I waddle like a duck when I'm off the scooter.

DOCTOR J269
You finished cardiac rehab after your bypass right, a year ago?

PATIENT J269
Cardiac, what do you mean cardiac?

DOCTOR J269
You had rehab after your bypass?

PATIENT J269
Oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR J269
And then you were at the nursing home where you were getting rehab.

PATIENT J269
Yeah, yeah and I spent Tuesdays in PCC1B.

DOCTOR J269
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J269
And Wednesday on the 15th floor and also a short stay, I don't know what floor it was, for just a few days and that was reacting to diarrhea and at the time, then the C. diff though.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Um you're not getting any therapy right now?

PATIENT J269
I had a therapist coming in and uh I don't know what her name is, she used to come over to my son's house and I moved out of his house last week and I had a nurse, a real Polish nurse, a nice one, NURSE something or other.  I don't have her phone number, but my kids' got all the phone numbers and I wanted to contact both of them.

DOCTOR J269
Was that through the VA or who?

PATIENT J269
Yes.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.

PATIENT J269
I don't know who they are.

DOCTOR J269
Think it's somebody in therapy?

PATIENT J269
Well, yes sure.

DOCTOR J269
I don't think so uh, okay.

PATIENT J269
How do I get hold of the therapist and the one that's been seeing me?

DOCTOR J269
I don't know about the one that's seeing you.

PATIENT J269
Alright.

DOCTOR J269
Um I can put an order in to get a therapist.  You can always try calling your son and have your son call them and you now we need an order and I'll put an order for therapy.

PATIENT J269
Okay but what about the nurse?  She's been checking my vitals.

DOCTOR J269
Yeah a home nurse.

PATIENT J269
Yeah.  I'll be concerned about seeing her; she's a very good nurse.  She was coming in Friday to see me and then last Friday I missed her.  The therapist was coming in on Saturday and I missed her.

DOCTOR J269
You there's a program here called Home-Based Primary Care.

PATIENT J269
Yeah.

DOCTOR J269
And what it means is a doctor comes out to visit you at your house every so often instead of you coming here to Hines um and also nurses come out and visit you every so often.

PATIENT J269
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J269
Um, they basically become your primary care doctor but I'm wondering since you really are liking the fact that these people are coming to your house and checking up on you and that type of thing.

PATIENT J269
Okay.

DOCTOR J269
Is this something you would be interested in?

PATIENT J269
Yes.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Let me talk to people and see what it takes to get you in the program there.

PATIENT J269
Sure.

DOCTOR J269
Cause it almost sounds like, you know, it's the type of thing, you @@@ so much success with this, sounds like they keep a close eye on you at home and uh and it may help that way.  Okay, do you need your meds refilled I assume?

PATIENT J269
Yeah.  They'll have them going down to the Pharmacy but I won't be able to get all that filled today unless you have some other medication for me.  That you can have mailed to me.

DOCTOR J269
Okay, yeah we'll mail those up to you.

PATIENT J269
Yeah.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Let me take a listen to you.  Just stay right there.  @@@ alright.  Big breath in now.

PATIENT J269
There's a crackling in the right lung I guess uh, I think its scar tissue and uh uh, I had four CAT scans plus a CT scan.

DOCTOR J269
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J269
And it wasn't getting any worse.  The first one was seen and then the three after that were not getting worse so they weren't concerned about that.  But the scar tissue was there.

DOCTOR J269
From a former pneumonia?

PATIENT J269
Yeah.

DOCTOR J269
So you've seen a pulmonologist it looks like.  They want you to get another x-ray of your chest is that right?

PATIENT J269
When?

DOCTOR J269
This month or next month.

PATIENT J269
Will they send me an appointment?

DOCTOR J269
Uh we can get one set-up.

PATIENT J269
Well about, you know last year I asked you, this is last year, I asked you about my triglycerides.

DOCTOR J269
Yeah.

PATIENT J269
They were high.  I don't think you were concerned about that because uh nothing was done but boom, in November I had to have open heart surgery and quadruple bypass.

DOCTOR J269
Yeah.  So are you concerned it was the triglyceride that did that?

PATIENT J269
I don't know, I can say that.

DOCTOR J269
Uh, it probably wasn't.  Um, you have diabetes right.

PATIENT J269
How can you check the diabetes?

DOCTOR J269
Oh there's ways to do these. It looks like it’s really well controlled, really.  Um triglycerides are not even really, they are a very minor risk factor for heart disease.

PATIENT J269
Well it was 300 all that time; it said 300, 300, 300.

DOCTOR J269
180 is the last one we have done here.

PATIENT J269
I did when was that?

DOCTOR J269
That was back this past summer in June.  Prior to that.

PATIENT J269
Well that's when I was hospitalized in 1B.

DOCTOR J269
Prior to that it was 192 and that was back in February.

PATIENT J269
And prior to that it was 300.  Cause it was controlled back then I guess.

DOCTOR J269
Yes.

PATIENT J269
With the diet and everything.

DOCTOR J269
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J269
And this was before.

DOCTOR J269
And your other cholesterol panel was fine, so I think that, you know um, taking all that together, you don't want to go aggressively and you are on a couple of medications for that.

PATIENT J269
Really.

DOCTOR J269
Uh, @@@ and all that stuff okay.  Yeah I don't know if I'll change that.  I want to recheck the cholesterol panel the next visit.

PATIENT J269
Oh Zocor, they put me on a half and you had me on the full tablet.

DOCTOR J269
Who switched it?

PATIENT J269
I don't know.  Listen when I got out of the 15th floor in the main building.

DOCTOR J269
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J269
There was uh a nurse over there that screwed up on six of my medications and I called DOCTOR and DOCTOR called her and boy she really moved and she called my son at the time when I was staying with him and she apologized for those goof ups.  There were medical increases that the doctors gave me while I was in the hospital there and there were, I don't know what changes they were but anyway it amounted to six of them and that wasn't too good for a nurse practitioner.

DOCTOR J269
Yeah.  Let's um, let's recheck your cholesterol and see how it's been on the dose that you've been taking.

PATIENT J269
Okay.

DOCTOR J269
And then we can make changes based on that.

PATIENT J269
As long as I'm staying with the 5 mg.

DOCTOR J269
You're taking 10; you're taking half of a 20.

PATIENT J269
Yeah.

DOCTOR J269
Okay?

PATIENT J269
Yeah.  I've been taking a whole one.

DOCTOR J269
You have?

PATIENT J269
Cause I remember, I remember I was on a whole one before and @@@.

DOCTOR J269
Was it a different dose though?

PATIENT J269
See I didn't see?

DOCTOR J269
It @@@ dose, if you're on 20, so I'll give you a 40 and tell you to split in half.

PATIENT J269
Okay.

DOCTOR J269
If you're on 10, they'll give you a 20 and tell you to split in half so.

PATIENT J269
No I'll check it and see if it's 20 or 40.

DOCTOR J269
If it says that you're getting 20, you should be splitting it so.

PATIENT J269
Okay.

DOCTOR J269
Um, okay.  Give me a minute and I'll be right back.  We'll get some of this, I'll get some of the meds refilled and we'll get some of this, we'll help you get some PT.

PATIENT J269
Nothing’s different except for this except Tylenol.

DOCTOR J269
@@@.  The pain um, there is other things um.  Anti-inflammatories I don't think you'd be a good guy to take those.

PATIENT J269
You know my nerves are acting up in my foot cause I had that broken heel and foot.

DOCTOR J269
Yeah.

PATIENT J269
And uh the nerves and what the hell, oh my teeth bother me like hell.  I mean I don't know I can't get into the dentist unless I have a high diabetic count.

DOCTOR J269
Yeah you can't get into the dentist here.  @@@.

PATIENT J269
I did once, one had a blood count.  You can't do it but the blood would say it.

DOCTOR J269
Yeah.  You have to be shaken up to really warrant it and I don't think.

PATIENT J269
They had me in there once.  This diabetes has been fluctuating on and off, on and off.

DOCTOR J269
So, it's not a bad enough now problem, that's the problem.  This is my concern with giving you a bunch of pain medications.  You're on a lot of medications.

PATIENT J269
You'd better believe it.

DOCTOR J269
And you know a lot of it can cause drowsiness and other things and the pain medication would worsen all of those and especially the risk of falling, uh given all these other medications.

PATIENT J269
I want to get up and go walk around again.  I can barely walk.  I walk like a duck you know.  It's just a few inches at a time.

DOCTOR J269
Yeah, I mean I don't want you to fall and break your hip or hit your head or something.

PATIENT J269
Ah, so you break your hip you know.

DOCTOR J269
Uh hip breaks are fatal in 50% of people your age.

PATIENT J269
Oh yeah, well how many?

DOCTOR J269
50%.

PATIENT J269
Well 50% do alright.

DOCTOR J269
I don't think it would be in good conscious I could do something like that. Um, you know I want to give you some pain medicine but I think we need to think very carefully about.

PATIENT J269
What's that?

DOCTOR J269
About what we can give you.

PATIENT J269
Well so I can pick it up tonight in the Pharmacy?

DOCTOR J269
I don’t know what else I can give you other than Tylenol at this point.

PATIENT J269
Well I've been taking Tylenol, that's a short running thing.

DOCTOR J269
When is the pain the worse, is it all day?

PATIENT J269
All day, all night.  I had a bad night.  I couldn't sleep at all last night.  Uh on and off, on and off, on and off, I don't know how many times, 20, 30, 40 times.  That's not sleeping.

DOCTOR J269
Where is it the worst, if you point one finger?

PATIENT J269
By here.

DOCTOR J269
Is it just in one certain place?

PATIENT J269
It's right in the eye.

DOCTOR J269
Yeah is it the entire eye, is it like a certain lid?

PATIENT J269
No it's in the left, see when I blink I feel it, I can't touch my eyelid.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Let me see; let me see what we have here that um.

PATIENT J269
Yeah please.

DOCTOR J269
That I think might be safe for you okay.

PATIENT J269
Please.

DOCTOR J269
Alright give me one second.

(DOCTOR OUT:  59:20  DOCTOR IN:  64:14)

DOCTOR J269
Alright so.  I was looking at; you were on Vicodin in the past?

PATIENT J269
Yeah I don't care for that Vicodin.

DOCTOR J269
Have you had Tylenol 3?

PATIENT J269
No, could Tylenol number 3, maybe I ought to try that.

DOCTOR J269
What was the issue with Vicodin?

PATIENT J269
Huh?

DOCTOR J269
What was your issue with Vicodin?

PATIENT J269
None.

DOCTOR J269
Did it work or?

PATIENT J269
Yeah it worked.  I was getting it three times a day in the hospital.

DOCTOR J269
Okay.  Do you want to try some of that or no?

PATIENT J269
Yeah, you better set me up with the Vicodin then.

DOCTOR J269
Okay we'll try that.  

PATIENT J269
@@@ the dosage.

DOCTOR J269
I don't know um.  This Vicodin has Tylenol in it so don't take any Tylenol on top of it.

PATIENT J269
