PATIENT G922
Shortness of breath is normal, you know, I move too fast, that’s my problem.

DOCTOR G922
How far do you have to walk before you’re short of breath?

PATIENT G922
It varies.  When I walk in from the parking lot, a pretty good walk so I walked real slow which is unnatural for me and I wasn't gasping for air and like I say, from my living room to my car, which is like 10 or 15 feet, I’ll be gasping.

DOCTOR G922
Okay.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
@@@.

PATIENT G922
@@@ physical therapy, I must move too fast @@@ gasping like that.

DOCTOR G922
How many stairs can you go up?

PATIENT G922

PATIENT G922
Na.

DOCTOR G922
Still smoking?

PATIENT G922

PATIENT G922
No don't.  @@@.

DOCTOR G922
Okay, alright, that's okay.

PATIENT G922
And I do, I know what I have to do and @@@ it’s not your fault.  And how much longer do I have you doc?

DOCTOR G922
Um at the end of May @@@.

PATIENT G922
But you are still gonna be here right?

DOCTOR G922
@@@.  So actually in June I won't be necessarily here but starting July 1st I'll be @@@ so I'll be around.  You just pop your head in @@@.  

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
@@@ I sit in that room there.

PATIENT G922
So I'm not gonna see you.

DOCTOR G922
@@@.

PATIENT G922
One more time maybe?

DOCTOR G922
Yes, you can come back in May if you want, you might.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
You don’t want to see me that bad. (laughs)

PATIENT G922
But I do want to see you @@@.

DOCTOR G922
Well @@@ I know.  I love to try and get you tuned up a bit.  @@@ any concerns.  You're not having any muscle aches @@@ or did you know that.

PATIENT G922
I don't think so.

DOCTOR G922
Okay.

PATIENT G922
I mean you know I'm out of shape and all and that doesn't help you know.  I don't think anything out of the ordinary, as I say, my neck and shoulders and back @@@. 

DOCTOR G922
Well we need to talk about something.  You know your statin medicines.

PATIENT G922
Yeah.

DOCTOR G922
You know your statin medicine for your cholesterol.  Okay the simvastatin.

PATIENT G922
Yes.

DOCTOR G922
And remember, we decreased the dose because @@@ liver function tests.

PATIENT G922
Yeah.

DOCTOR G922
And um it can cause liver, it's not only your liver function tests, it's also your muscle enzymes.  Your liver is actually fine so the statins can cause your muscles to really ache okay and sometimes we can check on the blood level of your muscle enzymes and some people who @@@ have a normal muscle enzyme level and some people have an elevated muscle enzymes with no muscle aches.  And you have an elevated muscle enzyme level and you're on the medicine that's probably causing that okay.  So there's a problem when the, when the medicine causes symptoms but this medicine isn't only causing you symptoms, it's causing the abnormal labs.

PATIENT G922
Why is that?

DOCTOR G922
@@@ get that so, we need to know if you have any muscle aches.  Cause if you're having muscle aches you should stop the medicine but right now, the risks of you getting muscle aches because your muscle enzyme is up is so low, but the risk of you getting a heart attack, with your cholesterol level is much higher.  Does that make sense?

PATIENT G922
Yes.

DOCTOR G922
So we have to kind of weigh the risks and the benefits here.  But that's why you need to know your cholesterol medicine is causing your liver enzymes to go up a little tad.  Which I'm not worried about.

PATIENT G922
Now can they get lower, did it come down at all?

DOCTOR G922
So yes, if you come down definitely and then when you went back on it, a little bit, it went back up a tad okay.  You've always had high, so that's why I'm not so worried about it okay.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
It was 280 back in 2001 and it went up to 443 and now it's 376 so I'm not really concerned about it.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
Okay, not at all.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
@@@ liver problems, this is not your liver; it's your muscle enzymes.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
Does that make sense?

PATIENT G922
So if you're not concerned I'm not worried about it.

DOCTOR G922
I’m not. I think we should stick right with …

PATIENT G922
Cause you know what you're doing.

DOCTOR G922
I think we should stick right at the 40.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
Especially if you're not having muscle aches.  If you have muscle aches, then we need to rediscuss it.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
@@@ Claritin, right?

PATIENT G922
No.

DOCTOR G922
And you’re still on the allopurinol?

PATIENT G922
Yes.

DOCTOR G922
And uh your back pain, it looks like you saw Ortho and Pain Clinic.

PATIENT G922
Yeah, and I haven’t heard anything from them yet.

DOCTOR G922
So your EMG looks okay.

PATIENT G922
That is the nerve test, that looks good?

DOCTOR G922
@@@ so that's good, very good. They are following you in the clinic. You had some recent x-ray.  When are you going back there, let’s see, we don't have that scheduled and then you have a Neurology appointment too.

PATIENT G922
In May.

DOCTOR G922
In May so that'll be good.  I think you should just continue the @@@.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
Okay.  The depression, you're taking the Wellbutrin twice a day.  You're off the venlafaxine.

PATIENT G922
@@@ still taking.

DOCTOR G922
You are still taking it.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
I'm sorry the @@@ you're off of.

PATIENT G922
Yes.

DOCTOR G922
Okay.  Um so DOCTOR said in his note that he wants to increase your venlafaxine but it can increase your blood pressure and he wanted me to comment about that, saying that he thinks it’s most ideal for you that you go up on your venlafaxine.

PATIENT G922
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G922
I think that's definitely fine.  I'm going to put in my notes and send it to him and you can tell him too that DOCTOR says it's okay to go up on the venlafaxine.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
If your blood pressure goes up because of the venlafaxine, we'll take care of it okay.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
Or your next doctor will.  That's no problem.  I can make your blood pressure @@@ with medicine.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
What I can't do is make you mentally better without medicine okay.

PATIENT G922
Right.

DOCTOR G922
Alright.  Good.  Health maintenance wise, you're gonna be due for a colonoscopy next year.

PATIENT G922
Has it been 10 years already, really?

DOCTOR G922
It's due in 2001.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
Time flies when your colon is not good.  And then you'll be due for a tetanus shot next year okay.  @@@ you can, I'm going to put all of this in here, there won't be a problem.  They'll be able to look at everything that's been done and we have it all right here.

PATIENT G922
Yeah but they're not going to be as good as you.

DOCTOR G922
I don't know, I hope so.  Your pneumonia shot won't be due for two years okay and they'll go through this with you.  You should get a flu shot every single year and you know, I feel like a failure for not getting you to stop smoking.  @@@.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight @@@ because I did not get you to stop smoking.

PATIENT G922
@@@.  You do everything you can.

DOCTOR G922
And the last, I'm going to get on my soap box and you're only 60 years old, if you live to 75 @@@.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
It's the worst addiction known to man.

PATIENT G922
No kidding, you aren't kidding.

DOCTOR G922
No I mean really.

PATIENT G922
People think it's hard to get off drugs.  I don't know.  I know I have to and there’s that little 1% @@@.  And I hate it.  99% of these, boy let's quit right now.  That 1%.

DOCTOR G922
Well.

PATIENT G922
Are we going to do anything about this @@@ stuff now.

DOCTOR G922
Well you know we could @@@ fevers or chills, it's probably just a virus.

PATIENT G922
It’ll go away.

DOCTOR G922
We @@@ fluids, hydration and over-the-counter cough medicine.

PATIENT G922
Let me know.

DOCTOR G922
I'm gonna listen to your lungs, if your lungs are clear.  If you're not having fevers and you're not coughing up blood, @@@ virus.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
If you start feel like shit, then come back @@@.

PATIENT G922
I @@@ let you know.

DOCTOR G922
Yeah definitely.  If you start to feel really bad then that's different.  You might have pneumonia, but it sounds like.

PATIENT G922
@@@ please don’t say that.

DOCTOR G922
@@@.

PATIENT G922
@@@ almost died last time.

DOCTOR G922
You just need to know that @@@.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
I know.  Well you need to know that sometimes viruses can turn into pneumonia.  And if that’s the case, come back to the ER.

PATIENT G922
It's still a little high on this end.

DOCTOR G922
@@@ the ER.  I know, I remember looking at that @@@.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
@@@ You know how pneumonia kills people, @@@.  Who does pneumonia kill?

PATIENT G922
Smokers.

DOCTOR G922
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

PATIENT G922
You know what though you're not gonna believe this.

DOCTOR G922
What?

PATIENT G922
I never had no problem breathing until I that pneumonia @@@ hospital.

DOCTOR G922
You see @@@.

PATIENT G922
I never got asthma, I never short of breath.

DOCTOR G922
It's all about the scarring in your lungs.  You're scarring your lungs every single day with cigarettes okay.  Every day you're scarring a little bit of your lungs.

PATIENT G922
But you know what I'm saying.

DOCTOR G922
When you get pneumonia, your big scar happens in your lungs okay.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
A big scar, you have a big infection, @@@ infection, if you get an infection in your hand or your toe or something like that or it's in your lungs.

PATIENT G922
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G922
The infections a scar and so it's, the reason you get bacteria is because you're bringing it in with the smoke and with the toxins that get in there and cause infection so that's why smokers scar more, smokers get more infections that scar more and you know people who get repeated pneumonia they start chipping off their lung volumes.

PATIENT G922
How come you never smoked?

DOCTOR G922
Why have I not ever smoked?  Cause I want to live.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
I've got my vices, trust me.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
Oh no, no one else's.

PATIENT G922
Well that's it, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR G922
I know @@@.

PATIENT G922
I was an alcoholic with drinking and smoking @@@.

DOCTOR G922
I know, trust me I have a lot of issues with my family and I have some @@@ smoke but I mean it never was an option for me because I knew.  I mean I'm not gonna lie to you, I've had a cigarette or two in my life outside and everything like that.

PATIENT G922
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR G922
But it's a thing, kind of like why do this to myself and I know it's hard.  I know it's hard but you can do it.  I know you can do it.  You're a slave to your cigarettes.  Deep breath.  And it's expensive.  Look how much money you've had.

PATIENT G922
Well, that's why I only @@@.

DOCTOR G922
(Laughter)  that’s your strategy?

PATIENT G922
Well, because when the day is over @@@.

DOCTOR G922
Financially uh it's a benefit for you financial to date people with cigarettes?  I'm sorry, any swelling.

PATIENT G922
No.

DOCTOR G922
Any belly pain?

PATIENT G922
No

DOCTOR G922
Blood in the stools?

PATIENT G922
No.

DOCTOR G922
Vomiting, @@@ or anything like that?

PATIENT G922
No.

DOCTOR G922
Nope.  Well alright my friend I don't have anything for you today.

PATIENT G922
Well I guess that's good news.

DOCTOR G922
That's good news.  Alright.

PATIENT G922
And you just tell me where to drop in and say hi.

DOCTOR G922
Alright I will.  So I'll have you @@@ four months @@@.  Okay.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
@@@ then you’ll be due for labs after you see the new doctor in four months.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
Okay and um I think we've covered everything.  Um you will need to stay seeing Mental Health.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
And they’ll increase your medicine and we can go up on the blood pressure medicine if we need to.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
And um um and let's just real quick, just so we can kind of talk about it, do you know what the signs of heart failure are?

PATIENT G922
No.

DOCTOR G922
Let's talk about that.  So @@@ you need to come back and see DOCTOR or whoever come to the ER, if you start getting short breath just getting here, you need to come in.  If you start swelling up, you need to come in.  If you gain four pounds in one day you need to come in.

PATIENT G922
Ah I can do that.

DOCTOR G922
You can do that, okay.  Well if you start gaining weight, on a daily basis.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
You gain four pounds and all of a sudden you're just ten pounds up, that's water for you, that's not food.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
Okay.  No matter what you’ve been eating.  If you start finding that you have to sit in a recliner to sleep because you can't sleep laying down on pillows, that's heart failure okay.  If you find that you know I used to be able to go up one flight of stairs and I didn't have to stop in the middle due to short of breath but now I can't even climb a few stairs without getting short of breath, that's heart failure okay.  Those are all signs of heart failure, and you need to come in.  You've got a little bit of a weak heart here.  You’ve chipped away at your heart muscles too with a heart attack.

PATIENT G922
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G922
And stuff so we need to just keep that in tune.  One more thing I want to talk to you, I think I talked to you about this before is that you have a little bit or your heart function is less than 30% and what we know with people with heart function less than 30% is and some other details that we know that sometimes they can benefit from a defibrillator.  We can put a little tiny box in your heart that if your heart would have stopped it would restart it.  Cause what we know is people with heart failure, when they die, you die suddenly.  Sudden cardiac death is what we call it and it’s just because your heart has an abnormal rhythm @@@.  And what we know is that people will live longer with heart failure if we put in something in their heart to shock it.  You see those defibrillators that you know the schools have and they have them in the airports and stuff like that in hospitals, that's what this is but it's in you already.

PATIENT G922
How come nobody has mentioned that before?

DOCTOR G922
Well it’s just something to talk about  I mean it's like you need to get back and see your cardiologist because we repeated a few echoes and it still shows that your heart function is a little bit low okay and it's right on the cusp definitely but I do want to make sure you have every benefit that you have that you can get to help this.  Alright, you're right on the cusp and obviously you're doing so good I would be hesitant to do that but I think that you deserve a discussion with them okay, a defibrillator is what that is.  Alright cause I'd hate to see you coming back here with you know your heart stopped and then a problem restarting it and it's too late @@@ when we could have had this discussion before and it could have potentially saved your life, okay.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
So I want you to see the cardiologist again to discuss that next time.  There's no hurry.  This isn't an emergency or nothing like that.

PATIENT G922
I've never seen a cardiologist.

DOCTOR G922
Yeah you have.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
In May.

PATIENT G922
So I don't have one.  I mean why did I see him in May?

DOCTOR G922
Because you have significant heart disease.  You have enough heart disease that you can see a cardiologist once every, every year or so.

PATIENT G922
I agree.

DOCTOR G922
Okay, so I want you to make an appointment with a cardiologist @@@.

PATIENT G922
You can't put it in there already?

DOCTOR G922
No because the @@@ get a new one.

PATIENT G922
Oh okay.

DOCTOR G922
If they're not here, you'll need to get a new one.

PATIENT G922
So if I saw him in May would they automatically set one up in May or no?

DOCTOR G922
@@@.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
Okay.

PATIENT G922
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR G922
@@@.

PATIENT G922
Just tell them that you said that.

DOCTOR G922
He wrote that in there too.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
@@@.  That it's 30% and @@@.  The defibrillator is not for everybody.  It's a surgical procedure but I think it's something that I think that you should have a conversation about @@@.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
@@@ for you.

PATIENT G922
Okay.

DOCTOR G922
Alrighty?

PATIENT G922
Thank you.

DOCTOR G922
@@@.

PATIENT G922
No what do I have to do @@@.

DOCTOR G922
Yeah right now.

PATIENT G922
The one I came out of.

DOCTOR G922
Yep it's the one right there.

PATIENT G922
@@@.

DOCTOR G922
Yep.  @@@.
