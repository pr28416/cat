Um I feel like I have restless leg and I was seeing on the TV um restless leg syndrome.

DOCTOR B097
Uh-huh.

PATIENT B097
And I don't have it every day but I um definitely when I'm laying down have it you know and that's when a lot of times I'll get up and take another metoprolol.

DOCTOR B097
Okay, it's sorry about that it's a Code Blue or something.  Alright.

PATIENT B097
And that's when I'll get up and take a metoprolol and then stay up for a while and what I'll do is try to relax or something.

DOCTOR B097
Okay so do you feel, during the day not at night when you're sleeping I mean during the day do you feel like you're anxious or that you have @@@, do you notice anything going on?  Do you feel like that?

PATIENT B097
Uh not every day.  Not every day.

DOCTOR B097
Okay.

PATIENT B097
Um but you know and some days you know I am uh you know kind of uh really wound up.

DOCTOR B097
Yeah.

PATIENT B097
I feel yeah.

DOCTOR B097
Uh do you find yourself, like, a worrier?

PATIENT B097
No.

DOCTOR B097
Okay so a lot of what you're telling me it seems like its stress versus anxiety.

PATIENT B097
Hmm.

DOCTOR B097
There's what we call generalized anxiety disorder.  @@@ and how they have a lot of anxiety and how they use anxiety they kind of manifest you know it might be provocations.  @@@ things like that usually from like you have episodes where you can have a lot of sweating, you can't sleep, sleep disturbances, you're like worrying a lot, @@@.

PATIENT B097
But I'm not a worrier.  It's like in each of these cases going back since the day we met I feel like its Christmas morning all, you know all the time.

DOCTOR B097
Yeah.

PATIENT B097
You've heard me say that.

DOCTOR B097
Yes.

PATIENT B097
You know and um you know I've just had this you know this feeling um.

DOCTOR B097
Just a lot of @@@.

PATIENT B097
Yeah I just don't know, I mean I don't know what it is but I just feel like you know there's some sort of, almost like an excitement feeling.

DOCTOR B097
Yeah.

PATIENT B097
You know um.

DOCTOR B097
You know what I think?  So the metoprolol that's you know a medicine to manage your heart rate, blood pressure.

PATIENT B097
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B097
A side effect is that um usually a bad side effect in someone as young as you are, um they tend to be tired.  But it seems to be to your benefit.

PATIENT B097
Yeah.

DOCTOR B097
You know that side effect, which is not a bad thing as long as you don't take too much of it but I feel that I think it’d be better to address with the meds that act on actual stress so there are certain meds that relax you and certain meds that act on the stressors and then you know when it comes down to it there are things you can do to relax yourself.

PATIENT B097
Hmm.

DOCTOR B097
Uh what kind of hobbies do you have?

PATIENT B097
Um well there are things that I use to relax myself and to try to take away those feelings is stretching.

DOCTOR B097
Okay.  Alright.  Do you do like yoga or just like regular stretching?

PATIENT B097
Like regular stretching.

DOCTOR B097
Okay.

PATIENT B097
You know um like my ghetto version of yoga.

DOCTOR B097
Okay.

PATIENT B097
You know like I'll sit on the floor and actually try to you know stretch out the muscles you know @@@ stuff you know.

DOCTOR B097
Okay.

PATIENT B097
Um and but that's why sometimes when sometimes when my heart rate gets elevated like I told you um then I take a metoprolol because I feel that my heart rate goes back down on that, cause that's part of helping me relax.

DOCTOR B097
So do you feel anxious at the time @@@?

PATIENT B097
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B097
Okay.  So there's one part of @@@ anxiety, there's another part of is that has to do with mood and that is um like certain people you know like normal whatever that is, most people have like a mood profile where like you have peaks and valleys you know it kind of like this, and then you have people get a little more fluctuating, so you go up really high you feel so great, you can just do anything and you have all these projects at once, a lot of energy but then at certain times you go down and you just get feel, you don’t want to move, you don’t want to get out of bed, you know you just feel sort of @@@.

PATIENT B097
That's like textbook, that’s how I look.

DOCTOR B097
I'm actually one of those people I mean.  Some days I get up and I just want to, like I want to run, I want to put stuff together, I want to do all the work that I have to do for the month, I could probably do it right now and on other days I'm honest, I just want to pull down the shades @@@

PATIENT B097
And that's one of the things that I'm not complaining about is you know sometimes I'm top of the world and I'll be you know I’ll take apart all the closets in the house @@@ 

DOCTOR B097
Yeah.

PATIENT B097
Did this whole house, I'm organizing all the tables, I got roast in the stove, I'm doing really good and then what I don't get done, if it doesn't get done in the next couple days, it just sits there because @@@.

DOCTOR B097

PATIENT B097
I feel too overwhelmed you know and I don't know what's going on.

DOCTOR B097
Yeah.

PATIENT B097
You know.

DOCTOR B097

(Someone knocks on the door and the doctor talks with the person 104:00 - 105:4)

PATIENT B097
He needs some metoprolol.

DOCTOR B097
Yeah.  Okay, alright so.  But the people that deal with that is the psych doc. Those kinds of meds, the mood meds and the anxiety meds.

PATIENT B097
Yeah I'm on that venlafaxine and we recently upped the dosage on that to 300 and uh man I've been doing much better with depression with that.

DOCTOR B097
So you think, they monitor, they have you um you know like depression here but seeing as how you  @@@, you have really I would call you more like @@@ it's you know for some reason I feel it's more like a @@@ and then if use more, you know super @@@ or clinically depressed or clinically manic they  call that bipolar.

PATIENT B097

I wouldn't take metoprolol for it uh I'll increase what you're doing for your stress relief.

PATIENT B097
Hmm.

DOCTOR B097
@@@ I don't know if you increase activity, I don't know if you go out with your wife or you could go out.  @@@ you like doing that?

PATIENT B097

DOCTOR B097
Which is more than @@@ specific problem.  So what other hobbies you got?

PATIENT B097
Um I ride my bike a lot and it relates to having anxiety.  It's just that when I ride my back, it's to the extreme.
