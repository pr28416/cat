DOCTOR I717
PATIENT?  

PATIENT I717
How you doing?

DOCTOR I717
How you doing, my name is DOCTOR.  Have we met before?

PATIENT I717
I believe so.

DOCTOR I717
We have, I didn't have a chance to look through all the chart before I called you so um, you're on here for some reason for this week and for next week.

PATIENT I717
Huh?

DOCTOR I717
You have an appointment with me this week and next week.

PATIENT I717
I do.

DOCTOR I717
For some reason, I don't know.  You might want to cancel the next week one since it's in the computer.  Uh.

PATIENT I717
That was for my cholesterol.

DOCTOR I717
Maybe it was in the computer.  You saw DOCTOR last time.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
But that was more like your three so um I'll just kind of talk to you about @@@.  How are you doing today?

PATIENT I717
Okay.

DOCTOR I717
Any concerns, problems, grievances?

PATIENT I717
No I don't have any today.

DOCTOR I717
Huh?

PATIENT I717
None today.

DOCTOR I717
Okay and you also saw DOCTOR.

PATIENT I717
The appointment next week might be for cholesterol.

DOCTOR I717
Maybe this was with me and I don't know if I can see you twice in a row.

PATIENT I717
Oh okay.

DOCTOR I717
But you might just see the pharmacist or something but.

PATIENT I717
Yeah I think that's who it is.

DOCTOR I717
Yeah but for some reason it was made with me so when you leave here, just check with the front desk so you don't have an appointment for the doctor but with somebody else.  Uh.

PATIENT I717
Cause the last time I was here I saw the pharmacist.

DOCTOR I717
Yeah.  I'll take a look.  Your blood pressure's good.  So it looks like you have high blood pressure which is good and you are currently on.

PATIENT I717
No.

DOCTOR I717
@@@ Blood pressure right?

PATIENT I717
The um, the um pravastatin you gave me.

DOCTOR I717
Yes.

PATIENT I717
The last time, they're five times bigger than the ones I usually take.

DOCTOR I717
Really?

PATIENT I717
Yeah.

DOCTOR I717
Like phsically bigger?

PATIENT I717
Right.

DOCTOR I717
Are they hard for you to swallow?

PATIENT I717
Yes.

DOCTOR I717
Yeah.

PATIENT I717
The ones I had before were smaller round pink ones.

DOCTOR I717
And the problem, I think that you're on pravastatin, I don't know let me see um.

PATIENT I717
She @@@ the last time I was here.

DOCTOR I717
Did they tell you why they switched you from @@@?

PATIENT I717
They wanted a higher dosage.

DOCTOR I717
Yeah that's okay.  The pravastatin is stronger than simvastatin.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
So it sounds like you – and I’ve never met you before -  that you have trouble getting good control on the normal medicine, they put on you a bigger, a different medicine.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
And so it's a different manufacturer that made your medicine. 

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
They're going to be potentially bigger or smaller or a different shape or something like that.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
Is there a way to break it in half and take it half at a time?

PATIENT I717
I guess I can.

DOCTOR I717
And just try to do that and you look like you're already on a full dose of it right?

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
You had a set of labs in January, I don't know if you remember because that was a few months ago.

PATIENT I717
Yeah.

DOCTOR I717
Uh for your cholesterol and I was just kind of wondering, were you fasting that day?  Do you remember?

PATIENT I717
I think so.

DOCTOR I717
You think you were, cause it was still kind of high.  Your uh LDL which is your bad cholesterol, was 166.

PATIENT I717
Yeah she said it was going down some from the last time.

DOCTOR I717
It did go down some, that's correct, it did go down.

PATIENT I717
That's why I started taking the cholesterol test.

DOCTOR I717
Now you actually take them now?

PATIENT I717
Yeah.

DOCTOR I717
Um in January were you taking them?

PATIENT I717
Yes.

DOCTOR I717
Every day, not skipping any evenings always.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
Okay.  Well it's still kind of high um.

PATIENT I717
But now I tell you with these white ones.

DOCTOR I717
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I717
I haven't been taking them.  I've been taking my olds ones.

DOCTOR I717
I see okay.  So you.

PATIENT I717
Since I got those but I just got those like two weeks ago.

DOCTOR I717
Okay so.

PATIENT I717
So I was finishing up my small pink ones.

DOCTOR I717
I see, so when you took your last cholesterol test in January which ones were you taking?

PATIENT I717
The small ones.

DOCTOR I717
The small ones.

PATIENT I717
Yeah.

DOCTOR I717
Every time you were taking, you weren’t skipping doses?

PATIENT I717
Right.

DOCTOR I717
You weren't taking the new ones?

PATIENT I717
No.

DOCTOR I717
Okay.

PATIENT I717
They just came about two weeks ago.

DOCTOR I717
So you just got the new ones.

PATIENT I717
Yeah.

DOCTOR I717
And have you been taking them?

PATIENT I717
No.

DOCTOR I717
Cause they're too big.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
Okay.

PATIENT I717
I been taking the smaller ones.

DOCTOR I717
Alright, okay.  So let's try to do this, try to take the big ones and break them in half and take them half at a time and then once you're on those for about two months we'll recheck the cholesterol and see if you do better on those.

PATIENT I717
Okay.

DOCTOR I717
Okay.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
So that and then blood pressures are good.  Do you take an aspirin a day?

PATIENT I717
Yes.

DOCTOR I717
And then, alright.  Any more problem with stomach problems?

PATIENT I717
No.

DOCTOR I717
Do you have heartburn?

PATIENT I717
No since I take them every day.

DOCTOR I717
Okay.  Um smoking?

PATIENT I717
Yes.

DOCTOR I717
Uh any decreasing of how much you're smoking yet?

PATIENT I717
Yes.

DOCTOR I717
How much?

PATIENT I717
Um a pack will last me probably almost two weeks.

DOCTOR I717
Okay.  That's not bad at all.  Are you using the gum at all?

PATIENT I717
No.

DOCTOR I717
No.  Uh let's see and you had a colonoscopy last June which is fine.  Uh.

PATIENT I717
I'm planning on quitting smoking by the time I come back.

DOCTOR I717
Good, great.  Very good uh.  Alright, let's see.

PATIENT I717
I went to draw blood today but they said I wasn't in the computer so.

DOCTOR I717
Oh yeah, @@@

PATIENT I717
Yeah.

DOCTOR I717
And plus, I wouldn’t want to check until you’ve been on this new cholesterol medicine for a while.

PATIENT I717
Okay.

DOCTOR I717
Let's see.  Do you have any problem with breathing?  No shortness of breath from the smoking?  @@@  No weight loss, no blood in the urine or stool, nothing like that?

PATIENT I717
No.

DOCTOR I717
Okay.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
@@@. Sounds like we’re just following the cholesterol.

PATIENT I717
Yeah.  Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
Not a diabetic right?

PATIENT I717
No.

DOCTOR I717
Okay can you have a seat up here for me and I'll take a listen to you?  Take some deep breaths.  One more, one more, one more.  Breathe normally.  No chest pain, no weight loss, nothing like that?

PATIENT I717
No.

DOCTOR I717
Okay, look forward.  So all we're going to @@@ is medication refills or anything like that?

PATIENT I717
No, no.

DOCTOR I717
You don't need refills today for anything?

PATIENT I717
I just got some uh when I was here the last time a couple @@@.

DOCTOR I717
Alright, very good uh.  You have two refills, two refills and @@@.  Um other than that it should be good.  Okay and @@@.  You had you flu shot this year?

PATIENT I717
I had both of them.

DOCTOR I717
Good, you had a tetanus shot.  You had pneumonia @@@ okay.  Alright let me talk to DOCTOR and I think that we'll be.  Uh what we'll have you do is actually, I’ll order the cholesterol test and once you’re on these pills for six to eight weeks @@@ we can still have you come back and check to see the numbers are good, okay.

PATIENT I717
Okay.

DOCTOR I717
Alright.  Yeah and your good cholesterol is actually pretty darn good and you're bad cholesterol, your triglyceride cholesterol were all @@@ you just have a very isolated cholesterol to try to treat.

PATIENT I717
Okay.

DOCTOR I717
I'll be back within a couple of minutes.

(DOCTOR OUT:  17:02  DOCTOR IN:  30:27)
DOCTOR I717
Alright sir.  I had nice long conversation about your cholesterol pills and we got a little confused but we got him straightened out.  So you are taking now the simvastatin, the old little pill.

PATIENT I717
Old pink pill.

DOCTOR I717
Whatever, old pink pill.

PATIENT I717
Yeah.

DOCTOR I717
And how much of it, what's the dose of that one?

PATIENT I717
Um I think 20.

DOCTOR I717
20, only 20?

PATIENT I717
I think, I'm not sure.

DOCTOR I717
Okay.

PATIENT I717
But I'm taking a whole one.

DOCTOR I717
A whole one.  Okay, so here's the thing.  There's the cholesterol pill that you're taking, there's like a whole bunch of different ones.  They're all almost the same.

PATIENT I717
Hmm.

DOCTOR I717
Some are a little stronger, some are a little weaker, so we just have @@@ to try to figure this out.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
This new big one that you got sent is actually not as strong as the old little pink one.

PATIENT I717
Well that's 80.

DOCTOR I717
The dose itself actually they don't correlate with numbers.

PATIENT I717
Okay.

DOCTOR I717
How strong the actual medicine but they are similar but the dosing wasn't quite match up.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
So did you have diarrhea with the little pink pill?

PATIENT I717
Yeah.

DOCTOR I717
How much diarrhea, how bad was it?

PATIENT I717
Um just once, after I take it and a little while after I have to go to the washroom.

DOCTOR I717
Like one time.

PATIENT I717
Yeah.

DOCTOR I717
Okay so that's not real diarrhea.

PATIENT I717
No it was, I think it was cause you know I, how @@@ it.

DOCTOR I717
Yeah okay.  Are you willing to try it again I mean you've been taking it now.

PATIENT I717
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR I717
Without trouble.

PATIENT I717
Right.

DOCTOR I717
Okay.  So what we're gonna do is that little pink pill also has a dose of 80.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
Which sounds like you weren’t on.  So we'll try to do that.  We'll put you on a full dose of the old pink pill okay.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
And have you take that because it's stronger and it's smaller.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh, right.

DOCTOR I717
So it sounds like you’d rather take it.

PATIENT I717
Alright.

DOCTOR I717
So we'll stop the pravastatin, the big horse pills.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
Uh and then I'm gonna give you the full dose of the other one okay.

PATIENT I717
Okay.

DOCTOR I717
And we'll see how your cholesterol does on that.

PATIENT I717
Okay.

DOCTOR I717
Now and if you are on that pill full dose and you're taking it and you take it for at least a year.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
And we still can't get your cholesterol under control; we actually do have another one that's stronger okay.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
So we'll talk about that if the other one @@@ okay.

PATIENT I717
Okay.

DOCTOR I717
Okay.  Alright, does that make sense?

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
So I put in the new same as the old pink pill.

PATIENT I717
Can you mail it?

DOCTOR I717
I'll put it in to mail, yeah, mail okay.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
Does that make sense?

PATIENT I717
Yeah.

DOCTOR I717
Alright now we'll see you in about two months.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
And before you come in could you get the cholesterol done so we can have that to talk about.

PATIENT I717
Okay, but you got to put it in right?

DOCTOR I717
Yeah, yeah I'm gonna put it in right now.

PATIENT I717
Cause the last one when I went to the Lab they said there was.

DOCTOR I717
They said, no I'll put it in right now for two months from now okay.

PATIENT I717
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I717
And we'll have you see DOCTOR in May, May 14th I put it in and I'll put in a lipid profile for a week before then okay.

PATIENT I717
