DOCTOR E148
Hi.

PATIENT E148
How are you?

DOCTOR E148
Good, good to see you again.  How you doing?

PATIENT E148
Not too bad, not bad.

DOCTOR E148
Good.

PATIENT E148
I had uh, I had some disappointing news this morning, I looked, I uh, my diabetic, I been taking the wrong dosage of this medication so my sugar was up so I had to you know get it down again you know and yeah I have to, I wasn't eating right.  So I know that so you know I have to, cause I usually eat fairly good you know, track of that stuff you know so.  But we got that straightened out so.

DOCTOR E148
Good.

PATIENT E148
I was spanked @@@.  She thought she was sending me home but I said no I had another appointment so.  Have you found out any results of that test?  Do you remember the test I took for my blood?

DOCTOR E148
The for your @@@?

PATIENT E148
Well I know @@@ and they didn't find anything.

DOCTOR E148
Exactly.

PATIENT E148
Okay now I went, I saw my heart doctor since then.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
He said stay off Plavix.

DOCTOR E148
Yep.

PATIENT E148
Okay.

DOCTOR E148
I read that.

PATIENT E148
I have not, I'm anxious to see what my results are now on that.  See really the main reason I really wanted to come today, I haven't, you know I tried to get a hold of you several times.  You were on vacation or something like that, it was during Christmas.

DOCTOR E148
Oh.

PATIENT E148
Or December.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
You were gone for a while and we were playing telephone tag.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
And you called me from your house or you might even call me from home.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
And I really appreciate that.  I couldn't get a hold of you and you couldn't get a hold of me because every time you called, I called back and nothing.

DOCTOR E148
Oh I know, that happens sometimes, it's hard.  So your blood count is what you want to know.

PATIENT E148
Yeah I guess that's what I need to know, I have no idea what I need to know but.

DOCTOR E148
Well we'll.

PATIENT E148
As long as it looks good.

DOCTOR E148
So, your urine you still have some protein in your urine.

PATIENT E148
Yeah she told me that already yeah.

DOCTOR E148
You knew that already.  Yeah.  And you know about your A1c so I'll skip over that.

PATIENT E148
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E148
This is your CBC so infection-fighting cells look great, normal.  Hemoglobin that's what falls when you bleed.

PATIENT E148
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E148
So that's your, the blood count I think you're worried about.  13 is normal.

PATIENT E148
Uh-huh.  Where am I at?

DOCTOR E148
You're at 13.

PATIENT E148
13 oh good.

DOCTOR E148
You're normal.

PATIENT E148
Good.  Now I cut back on the iron.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
Because you told me if after a month or I finished ferritin, I'm taking one a day.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
Is that right or not?

DOCTOR E148
Yeah so that's correct, that is what I told you um but I'm gonna show you we got some iron studies on you and your iron saturation's a little on the lower side so I definitely still keep and so is your iron 53.

PATIENT E148
Should I go up to two a day?

DOCTOR E148
Now have you had problems with constipation?  I think I'm going.

PATIENT E148
Yeah @@@.  I mean I've been going but it's been really been @@@.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
You it just hasn't been you know and every once in a while I get a good bowel movement.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
But it seems like every three days is a good bowel movement.  Every other day it's kind of sort of okay, today I have not had one.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
So, I’m constipated now, as we speak.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.

PATIENT E148
I mean that's why I feel constipation I'm probably not but who knows but when I go, I go, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR E148
Right.

PATIENT E148
I don't know why but I'm taking two a day, two of those um, you know those laxative things.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
I need to, I got plenty of those.

DOCTOR E148
The Docusate Senna.

PATIENT E148
I've got plenty of those.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.  Well you only have one refill so I'll refill those for you.

PATIENT E148
Thank you.

DOCTOR E148
So my thing with the iron is, I think you should at least continue to take one a day.  If you can't handle it.

PATIENT E148
Oh I say if it's normal I'll @@@ again.

DOCTOR E148
Because of the constipation I don't think you necessarily have to go up to two a day, you know.

PATIENT E148
Yeah.

DOCTOR E148
Those really are constipating pills.  You're not so low your hemoglobin, which is that blood count is in the normal range.

PATIENT E148
That's what I been @@@, I was really worried about that.

DOCTOR E148
So I'm fine with staying at one, one a day.

PATIENT E148
I haven't had any chest pain.  Remember I had chest pains on you know.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
I don't have it anymore.

DOCTOR E148
Oh wonderful.

PATIENT E148
And I think that's because I didn't have any blood you know.

DOCTOR E148
That's kind of essential for life, you gotta have blood.

PATIENT E148
You know.

DOCTOR E148
So do you want to go over the rest of your labs or did she go over those with you?

PATIENT E148
Who?  

DOCTOR E148
Uh the diabetic doctor.

PATIENT E148
Yeah she went over some stuff.  You can tell me what you want to tell me and then.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.  So cholesterol.

PATIENT E148
Yeah I got all that.

DOCTOR E148
Got all that.

PATIENT E148
Yeah and she said it was high.

DOCTOR E148
Um your electrolytes look good.

PATIENT E148
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E148
Your creatinine looks great.

PATIENT E148
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E148
So you're at 0.8.

PATIENT E148
I was worried about my electrolytes, I really was.  I thought that I would uh, now what's making me feel, I feel a little dizzy sometimes.  Could that be because my sugar is high?  It's not dizzy, it’s light-headed.

DOCTOR E148
@@@.

PATIENT E148
Dizzy, a little bit, just a little bit.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
I used to feel real lightheaded.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
Now it's just a little bit lately but about the last two weeks.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.

PATIENT E148
Not all the time.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
A little bit once in a while.

DOCTOR E148
Is it only when you're standing or immediately after you stand up?

PATIENT E148
No.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.

PATIENT E148
Not like it used to be uh uh.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.  Lightheaded even when you're sitting sometimes?

PATIENT E148
Well, like they took my test this morning on my lower end of my blood pressure.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
It was 40.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
48 I believe it was.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
And that's low.  Why is that, what causes that being low like that, can you tell me that?

DOCTOR E148
Variations in blood pressure and we've got you on blood pressure medicine um to control your blood pressure.  So really that low number um, a 48, shouldn't be causing you symptoms of lightheadedness.

PATIENT E148
Okay so that, so it must be, I guarantee it's probably my sugar then.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.  I mean it could be your blood pressure but I'd be more worried about the higher number being real low causing lightheadedness than the lower number being a little bit lower.

PATIENT E148
Now I get this @@@ lightheaded and it's, I can't even put it into words.  It's not all the time, it's just very, once in a while it lasts about maybe 10 minutes.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
For some reason.  My diabetic person said I got to get more exercise and uh I know I work but it's still not enough exercise.  You know what I mean; I'm not getting really much over there.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
I mean I do some things but I don't do anything real physical nor do I want to do anything real physical.  I want to do more aerobic type things like walking and stuff like that you know.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
I don't @@@.  I do a lot of standing and sitting.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
But @@@.

DOCTOR E148
What's your plan to do more exercise?

PATIENT E148
Um I'll tell you what, plan B is I have no plan.  Plan A is I have less than no plan um but I was thinking now that my sugar is you know, I'm starting to get a little concerned about it and uh I have, where I work is this gorgeous park.  I mean everybody and their brother's walking around this darn place and I'm not doing anything, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
I watch them walk you know but I don't do a damn thing to help you know so.  I don't know.

DOCTOR E148
So how many days a week do you work?

PATIENT E148
Too many.  I work between five and six days a week.

DOCTOR E148
Five and six days a week.

PATIENT E148
And I work eight hours a day when I work.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
But it's not hard work.  It's just like once in a while he'll have me come, I'll stay late at night.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
Cause I'm what they call, I work opposite him.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
He's doing this, I'm doing that.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
Okay so I'm like they call a closer.  You know @@@ the closer only, well I close okay.

DOCTOR E148
Sure.

PATIENT E148
As long as I can make sure the person's really @@@ and again that's a little stressful but not real stressful.  It's not like my old job used to be you know when I was really working.  You know this is a piece of cake believe me compared to what I used to do.  But then I have to come in early in the morning.  See I leave between 8:30 9 o'clock at night and pretty soon it'll be 9:30 at night and I have to come in at quarter after five in the morning.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
And every time I do, that takes me about a day and a half to recover from that.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
Because I don't get to sleep right away.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
Takes me forever to fall asleep.

DOCTOR E148
Well you know I think you need to make a point of at least three times a week to either show up to work early or you know stay late, depending on whether you're working late, come early and walk you know.

PATIENT E148
Yeah just take a, I could even go once around the place and it's be more than I'm doing now for crying out loud.

DOCTOR E148
Exactly.  It doesn't need to be anything big, huge.  Even if you start with you know a ten minute stroll would be.

PATIENT E148
It's getting out of bed.

DOCTOR E148
A ten minute stroll to get out of bed, that's kind of like a 20 minute stroll you know.

PATIENT E148
I know what you mean.

DOCTOR E148
So that should be uh, that should be your plan, small, small goals that have, it set and say you're gonna do it and then do it and then you can say come back and see me soon.

PATIENT E148
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E148
And say DOCTOR guess what I did? I've been walking three times a week for ten minutes and I'm feeling better you know.

PATIENT E148
So instead of saying doctor I'm a lazy bum.

DOCTOR E148
Exactly.

PATIENT E148
I'm gonna say I've been walking.

DOCTOR E148
And then I'm gonna cheer for you.

PATIENT E148
There you go, I love that.  I love when someone cheers for me you know.

DOCTOR E148
I know, I do too.

PATIENT E148
Cause usually they call me the bum of the month or something like that over at work you know, no I'm just kidding you.

DOCTOR E148
(Laughter)

PATIENT E148
No I kind of, it's kind of fun we have a real fun group over there.  So you know.

DOCTOR E148
Good.

PATIENT E148
It's a dream job for most guys.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
Really I mean and girls, it's really nice over there you know.  Too bad they don't pay you what a doctor gets paid cause you could work over there with us.  I'd just love to have you come.

DOCTOR E148
Oh well thank you.

PATIENT E148
You'd love that job cause you're out in the air all the time and now, three days a week I drive around in the golf cart.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
Well I do get more exercise when I do that because I get out and I move around a little bit you know.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
When I'm in the shop, I'm just running up the register you know, let me have your money you know, you know what I mean.  I make change to everybody that comes and I stand there.  I don't really get nothing, yeah I'll start.  That's where we're at so, so you think everything looks pretty good there as far as my hemoglobin and all that other stuff.

DOCTOR E148
Yep, as far as numbers.  Any blood in your stools that you see?

PATIENT E148
No, no I've been looking, no um.

DOCTOR E148
Good.

PATIENT E148
And in my urine no, uh uh.

DOCTOR E148

PATIENT E148

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
Okay.

DOCTOR E148
Yep.  So and you're on the proper meds to try and prevent any kidney disease from the diabetes, the losartan so.

PATIENT E148

DOCTOR E148
I don't know names of them.

PATIENT E148
Yeah.

DOCTOR E148
I can look in my records. Was it a new med?.

PATIENT E148
Uh yeah, it was because you put me on it because my blood pressures were real high and I wasn't, you know @@@ I take two now.  I used to take one, now I'm taking two.

DOCTOR E148
Imdur to 60 maybe, I increased your uh, I increased this one and isosorbide mononitrate.

PATIENT E148

DOCTOR E148
Okay.

PATIENT E148

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
I've been sleeping much much better.

DOCTOR E148
Good.

PATIENT E148
Cause you know I didn't sleep for almost a year and a half.

DOCTOR E148
Oh that's true.

PATIENT E148
I mean not that's terrible.  For an hour, an hour and a half a night you know.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
And I’m going to the bathroom less and less.  Only when my sugar level's up do I go to the bathroom more.

DOCTOR E148
That will do it.

PATIENT E148
You know so.

DOCTOR E148
That'll do it.

PATIENT E148
@@@.  I got one little joke to tell you before I leave okay.

DOCTOR E148
Good.

PATIENT E148
Okay, um this guy is really having problems he’s you know.  He's having sexual problems so he goes to the doctor and says at my age I shouldn't be having these problems I don't know what's the matter with me he says doctors says uh well he says what we can do here is take this jar, fill it up.  He says okay.  He says do you need anything like uh magazines or DVDs?  He goes nope doc I'll take care of everything.  He goes away and goes home, comes back the next day.  Doctor looks at the jar nothing.  He says what happened, he says well doc he said I got home, I put the DVD in, he said I tried my right hand and nothing happened.  Tried with my left hand nothing happened.  So I called my wife and she tried with the right hand nothing, she tried with the left hand nothing happening.  I called my neighbor and she came over, tried with her right hand nothing, tried with the left hand nothing and she said.

DOCTOR E148
@@@.

PATIENT E148
And he said you called your neighbor to help you out with this?  And he said yes and she couldn't get the lid off the jar either.

DOCTOR E148
(Laughter)

PATIENT E148
Isn't that cute.

DOCTOR E148
That's good, that's good.

PATIENT E148

PATIENT E148
Alright.  Alright @@@.

DOCTOR E148

PATIENT E148
Yeah, hello.

DOCTOR E148

PATIENT E148
Alright give it a shot.

DOCTOR E148

PATIENT E148

PATIENT E148
Oh that sounds good.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
That's probably what it should be @@@.

DOCTOR E148
It is 130/80.  Deep breath in for me good.  Alright that's good.  So one thing you are due for a tetanus shot.

PATIENT E148
I had one.

DOCTOR E148

PATIENT E148
I'm ahead of you.

DOCTOR E148
You are, good for you.

PATIENT E148
And it hurt for about a month.  It did, it was an owie.

DOCTOR E148
I believe you, those can be terrible and you've got just a touch of swelling in your legs.

PATIENT E148
No I had, every time I come she says the same thing, a little bit not much though.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
Maybe it's the @@@.

DOCTOR E148
I believe so.

PATIENT E148
No I feel good about that you know.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
I have blood so I feel good about that, it's pumping.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
You know all things being equal.

DOCTOR E148
Things are looking up right.

PATIENT E148
I couldn't ask for anything else.

DOCTOR E148
Alright.  Putting some of my paperwork in order here.  

PATIENT E148
So how have you been?

DOCTOR E148
How have I been?

PATIENT E148
Yeah.

DOCTOR E148
Been doing good, very good.

PATIENT E148
So things are going good for you as far as getting by you know.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
You're in your last year now?

DOCTOR E148
No this is the end of my first year.

PATIENT E148
They'll go by fast.

DOCTOR E148
Two more years for me.

PATIENT E148
Let us pray.  It's gonna be a long, I mean it's a long haul, seems like forever.  For you it must seem like forever.

DOCTOR E148
Well, yeah it can be tough but uh.

PATIENT E148
Yeah.

DOCTOR E148
But so far, so good, but I have two weeks left of work and then I have about a two week vacation before I start my next year so.

PATIENT E148
Now will you be, are you gonna be um, what do you study for?

DOCTOR E148
So I will get board certified in internal medicine by the end of this three years and I'll take a test and board certify in that.  So I'll be general internal medicine.  If I want to go on and do a specialty then I'll have to do a fellowship in that and I haven't decided.  I think I will probably just do general internal medicine, I just stay treating.

PATIENT E148
Yeah.  I mean there's a lot of GPs out there so you know.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
That ought to help you out a little bit you know what I mean.  You can get with anybody.  They're always looking for a @@@ you know.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
A lot of people are retiring now days, especially in Indiana.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.  @@@.  I think you know I enjoy doing a little bit of everything.

PATIENT E148
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E148
Kind of taking care of the patient as a whole and just being available for whatever they need.

PATIENT E148
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E148
So.

PATIENT E148
Let me ask you this, do you have any special area you want to live in, you know like Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, you know what I mean as far as where you'd want to live?

DOCTOR E148
I think I want to live in Kansas.

PATIENT E148
In Kansas, now are you from Kansas?

DOCTOR E148
Yep.

PATIENT E148
So you want to go back home.

DOCTOR E148
I think so yeah.  In fact uh my parents live there and I have my brother and his wife and nieces and nephews.

PATIENT E148
Yeah all of your family there.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
Yeah I've been through Kansas you know but never, the city itself.  I had once; I had a couple steaks there.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
That's about all I can say you know cause I stay overnight you know when I was traveling, a long time ago and uh I always liked Kansas I mean, what I saw of it, you know.  People seemed to be pretty friendly there, Midwesterners.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
I would say, wouldn't you say Midwesterners?

DOCTOR E148
Definitely.  That's really good.

PATIENT E148
But that's good, at least you get to go home you know.  Cause there's always something and you think, believe in the medicine field and the doctor field and all the hospitals, you should be okay.

DOCTOR E148
Yep.

PATIENT E148
They’ll never be short of that.

DOCTOR E148
I know.  I feel very blessed that I'll probably always be able to have a job, find a job.

PATIENT E148
Yeah.

DOCTOR E148
So tell me what is your plan for the diabetes?  When are you following up with them?

PATIENT E148
Three months.

DOCTOR E148
Three months okay, alright.  Then I don't think you necessarily need to see me in three months.

PATIENT E148
Not unless I, unless I have chest pains or something like that.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
And I will call you or go into the, if I have real bad chest pain I'll go into the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
But I'm going to, I told my cardiologist that I would uh call the doctor and let him know cause he was really concerned about it.  Cause before that, I said that blood thing must have done it, I mean that must have been cause my heart was working too hard I guess.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
For some reason.

DOCTOR E148
We call it demand ischemia so.

PATIENT E148
Okay.  If you say so.  You don't have to call it, you can call it Ray and you can call it Jay but you got to call it demand what is it?

DOCTOR E148
Demand.

PATIENT E148
Demand.

DOCTOR E148
Demand, so your heart is demanding.

PATIENT E148
Yeah.

DOCTOR E148
And then ischemia means uh kind of like hypoxia, that it's damaging the heart because your heart is working so hard.

PATIENT E148
So I'm @@@ oxygen @@@ everything.

DOCTOR E148
Yep, that's what it was.

PATIENT E148
Hmm.

DOCTOR E148
So I think six months would be good to see you.

PATIENT E148
Okay.

DOCTOR E148
Let me just talk with my attending and I'll be back.

PATIENT E148
Okay one thing.

DOCTOR E148
Of course.

PATIENT E148
Probably around December, when I quit, when I stop working again this year.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
That's probably when I'll probably see you.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.

PATIENT E148
Cause it doesn't make any difference between November and December, I'll make it work but if you want to put down December and then just set a date for that you know, that would work so.

DOCTOR E148
Sounds good.

PATIENT E148
Okay kiddo.

DOCTOR E148
Alright.

PATIENT E148
Sounds great doc.

DOCTOR E148
Give me just a few minutes okay.

PATIENT E148
Thank you so much.

DOCTOR E148
Of course.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:45  DOCTOR IN:  45:50)

DOCTOR E148
Alright.  So two more things, you have some low platelets, have you heard that term before?  Yeah so you've been losing blood for over a year and.

PATIENT E148
What are they?

DOCTOR E148
So they're a component in your blood that helps blood clotting and they're not so low that you're at risk for bleeding or.

PATIENT E148
Well that's because I'm taking all this medication, I'm on medication for the blood pressure medication.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
It's a blood thinner, I'm taking all this crap @@@ its working.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
Which is gonna lead me to have whatever the hell it is.  I know that I bleed, I bleed better you know than I used to.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
You know and uh now what do we want to do with that?

DOCTOR E148
So there are some lab studies we could do and then send you to a hematologist or specialist which is a blood specialist.

PATIENT E148
For?  But that means I have to pay money for that though.  If it's not important do you think I need to go I mean yet?

DOCTOR E148
So.

PATIENT E148
Could we wait till next time to see where I'm at?  I mean I'm sure they're not going to be real worse.  I mean higher.  I'm sure I'm not going to increase any but I don't.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
Really want to go at this time with my financial situation because I have to pay now.  I have to pay uh so much per visit.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
And in some ways, I don't have insurance.  I mean you know that's one thing cause I'm seeing four doctors now.

DOCTOR E148
I know.  That's a lot.

PATIENT E148
Yeah, yeah.  So I don't know what to do I mean.  Now what else is there, what else is this thing, the platelets are what is it, I'm low on platelets or?

DOCTOR E148
Yep low platelets.

PATIENT E148
I got nothing on my plate, what is this?

DOCTOR E148
So low platelets and you know I would expect you to bleed more because you're on the medicines but even being on these medicines the platelets are lower than what I would expect.

PATIENT E148
What are they supposed to be?

DOCTOR E148
So greater than 150.

PATIENT E148
I can't see what they were.

DOCTOR E148
You're at 62.

PATIENT E148
Okay.

DOCTOR E148
And yours have not been normal since oh about a here or so, 2009.

PATIENT E148
Well what causes that?

DOCTOR E148
October 2009.

PATIENT E148
Well what would cause that?

DOCTOR E148
So because I don't know the cause is why I'm sending, you know recommending that you go see.

PATIENT E148
Okay, I'll tell you what make me an appointment or do I have to make it myself.

DOCTOR E148
I'll put in a consult.

PATIENT E148
Okay.

DOCTOR E148
And then they'll schedule you for an appointment.

PATIENT E148
Why don't we say sometime in uh August?

DOCTOR E148
Okay.

PATIENT E148
August or September cause you know what I like to have it the same time I go see my diabetic.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.

PATIENT E148
And that'll be in September, sometime in there.  I'd like to get them together.  You know if I'm gonna go, then I don't mind going in you know what I mean.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.

PATIENT E148
It's not the fact that I even have the tests.  It's not that at all it's just, it's expensive.  It is expensive for me.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
Yeah it's not overly expensive I mean you know but.

DOCTOR E148
I know you work hard and.

PATIENT E148
I'm just the visit you know.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
And the visit, since I used to never have to pay for the visits, now I have to pay you know.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
And then what else do you want me to do?  What's the other thing?

DOCTOR E148
Um if you're open for getting lab work or if you want to wait on the lab work I would be more amenable to that.

PATIENT E148
What are you getting lab work like what?  Oh for that?

DOCTOR E148
Blood drawn.

PATIENT E148
What platelets?

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148

PATIENT E148
Today.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
So what would they do extra?

DOCTOR E148
B12 and folate, those are the two uh vitamins.

PATIENT E148
Vitamins could be low.

DOCTOR E148
Your vitamins.

PATIENT E148
Do you want to give me those?  Or am I taking those, taking something like that now?

DOCTOR E148
No I just want to see what your levels are in your blood.  I don't necessarily want to start more drugs.

PATIENT E148
Uh-huh.  No I don't want to do more drugs really.  I don't you know.

DOCTOR E148
No I don't either so you know if you want to wait and do all.

PATIENT E148
I'll do what I'm supposed to do yeah.

DOCTOR E148
The labs in August, September.

PATIENT E148
Yeah.

DOCTOR E148

PATIENT E148

DOCTOR E148
Okay.

PATIENT E148
I mean I don't care though.

DOCTOR E148
I'll put it in at that time.

PATIENT E148
They've drawn more blood from me than you know.  I'm probably down to 9 now after they do all the blood this morning.  You know it's no big deal bleeding because you know what it doesn't really bother me and that's uh, it is pain you know, a little blood doesn't really stop me.

DOCTOR E148
Yeah.

PATIENT E148
Tell them I'm amendable to that, to your suggestion because you are the best doctor in the whole world.

DOCTOR E148
Oh now you're just.

PATIENT E148
And.

DOCTOR E148
Being too nice.

PATIENT E148
No I'm not too nice; I just say what's in my heart.  You can't, you can't deny, you can’t call me a liar, talking about a man's heart you can't.

DOCTOR E148
Okay.

PATIENT E148
Alright.  Remember that line too, in case someone pulls it on you.

DOCTOR E148
Okay, alright that's it.  And let me know if you have any problems and good to see you.

PATIENT E148
I have another joke for you if you want to hear it.

DOCTOR E148
Alright.

PATIENT E148
It's kind of cute you know.  A choir boy he said something like, you he's got to go to confession.

DOCTOR E148
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E148
He says Father; forgive me Father for I have sinned.  Father says what's the matter my son?  He said well Father he says I've had illicit relationships with a member of our church.  He goes you have, son.  Yes I have.  He goes do I happen to know this young lady is it?  And he goes yes.  Yes, you do Father, you do know her.  He goes you care to tell me who it is?  And he goes no; I don't want to tell you who it is.  You know you would think I don’t want to hold that information back but I don't think it's relevant because.  He says well in a way it is I mean you know.  Well let me just say this, could it be a person named Ann and he goes, no.  I can't tell you Father.  He says how about, Mary.  No, how about, Sue?  No.  @@@ the names of two more girls right.  He goes no none of them.  He goes well I'll tell you here's your penitence.  I want you to say 40 Hail Mary's, 40 Our Father's and because you have really sinned I want you to have four months off from the altar, you cannot be an altar boy.  Father I… no my son that's my final, you cannot be an altar boy for four months.  Okay, so he goes up the stairs and all the guys are standing out waiting for him to come on out because he was taking up and they go what happened.  Well the bad news is I have to say 40 Hail Mary's and 40 Our Father's.  The good news is I get four months vacation and I have five new leads.

DOCTOR E148
