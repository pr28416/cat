DOCTOR G101

DOCTOR G101
130 before you eat lunch?

PATIENT G101
Yeah after.

DOCTOR G101
After you eat lunch?

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
What is it before you eat lunch?

PATIENT G101
It was like 180, @@@.

DOCTOR G101
And you don't take any insulin with lunch correct?

PATIENT G101
Right.  No I take it when I get up.

DOCTOR G101
You take the short-acting when you get up.

PATIENT G101
The regular one.

DOCTOR G101
When do you take the Glargine then?  When do you take the long-acting.

PATIENT G101
At bedtime.

DOCTOR G101
At bedtime okay.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
So you take the long-acting at bedtime.  You get up its like 284 and that's without eating.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
And then you take the 24 units now.

PATIENT G101
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G101
In the morning before you eat.

DOCTOR G101
How about after dinner?  After you @@@ then you take your insulin before dinner?

PATIENT G101
Right I take the regular, short-acting one at that time.

DOCTOR G101

DOCTOR G101
And then do you measure it ever after dinner, after you take your short-acting.

PATIENT G101
No.

DOCTOR G101
I’m going to see if we can check your blood sugar real quick.

PATIENT G101
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR G101
I think we need to recheck your A1c as well.

PATIENT G101
Right uh-huh.  I’m sure it’s bad.

DOCTOR G101
Well I'm sure it is.  Okay you seem to know that.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
The question is can we increase your Glargine, the nighttime insulin a little bit.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
Uh.

PATIENT G101
I know @@@.

DOCTOR G101
Oh.

PATIENT G101

DOCTOR G101
Are you not taking it at all?

PATIENT G101
What?

DOCTOR G101
How many times a week do you miss your Glargine?

PATIENT G101
Uh I take it every day.

DOCTOR G101
Okay well how many times have you missed it?  I know you try.

PATIENT G101
@@@ I missed it maybe @@@ not at all.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.

PATIENT G101
@@@ very concerned.

DOCTOR G101
Let's get you a glucose monitor.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
Alright let me just check your blood sugar alright.  

PATIENT G101
Let me do that.

DOCTOR G101
You want to do it?

PATIENT G101
Yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR G101
@@@ one of these.

PATIENT G101
@@@.  

DOCTOR G101
@@@ finger there.

PATIENT G101
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G101
There you go.

PATIENT G101
Is that it?  That's @@@.

DOCTOR G101
Yeah, that's it.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
Not bad.

PATIENT G101
@@@.  120 and under.

DOCTOR G101
That's good; I mean it should be when you wake up in the morning.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
That's what we, now if you take your Glargine at night when you wake up in the morning it needs to kind of 120 or under.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
Now what did you eat today?

PATIENT G101
Uh well @@@.

DOCTOR G101
What have you eaten today?

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
What time?

PATIENT G101
Around 12 noon.

DOCTOR G101
Did you @@@ before that?

PATIENT G101
Yes.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.  So it's about 4 o'clock now.

PATIENT G101
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G101
Okay so it's just four hours post prandially so it still might be a little bit high.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
Um.  Maybe what we can do is we can check your A1c.  If your A1c is really high.

PATIENT G101
Yeah.

DOCTOR G101
Uh then maybe I could give you a call and I could tell you to just increase your Glargine.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
Alright.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
Um but if it's fine then we can keep it as is okay.  We just made a change recently so you said it's still high.  Your morning blood sugars are still high.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
Right.

PATIENT G101
Well then before I had, I had one low.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.

PATIENT G101
I had one low level @@@ 98.

DOCTOR G101
Those are great.

PATIENT G101
Right.  @@@ before, before they increased it.

DOCTOR G101
Before the change.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
You said since the change your sugars have been higher?

PATIENT G101
Right.  And I was thinking uh that the Glargine is the long-acting, 20 and then I was taking uh the 70/30.

DOCTOR G101
Yeah.

PATIENT G101
I was taking 80 and 80.

DOCTOR G101
Oh.

PATIENT G101
Of that.

DOCTOR G101
Right.

PATIENT G101
And uh @@@ cause it was lower @@@.

DOCTOR G101
My suspicion.. but the 70/30.  Before, you were taking your blood sugar, you thought your blood sugar was more controlled with the 70/30 and the Glargine?

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.  So but what we just need to do is titrate up or increase what you're on now.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
Right.  Uh it's a little bit of a better you know regimen.

PATIENT G101
Yeah, okay.

DOCTOR G101
So let me see.  I think we'll check the A1c today.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
And kind of see where it's at.  I think if you're taking the 24 with meals and you're taking 20 just at night before you go to bed.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
And your blood sugars in the morning are still high; they're still very high right?

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
Um we should.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
You're doing a lot of pop.

PATIENT G101
Well not, no maybe one.

DOCTOR G101
Alright.  Do you want to quit that?

PATIENT G101
Yes I do.

DOCTOR G101
Alright.

PATIENT G101
Yes I do.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.  Um let's do that.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
Well it's tough for me to really know what to change when I don't see the blood sugar records okay.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
Let's take a look at your A1c; if it's still high then we'll consider increasing your Glargine dose.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
Probably we'll probably do that.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
I need to know also what your blood sugars are a couple hours after you eat and when you take the insulin with it because we need to make sure that that insulin, okay is accurate.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
So again, bring in your blood glucose log in a month.

PATIENT G101
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G101
Alright.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
We want to know what the morning is and we also want to know what it is two hours after you give yourself insulin in the evening.

PATIENT G101
Right, right.

DOCTOR G101
Those are important to know.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
Right so we need to know if we need to increase the dose.

PATIENT G101
Right @@@ it's pretty accurate.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.  I'm going to be right back okay.

PATIENT G101
@@@ possible @@@.

DOCTOR G101
To what?

PATIENT G101
@@@ Secretary of State @@@.

DOCTOR G101
I don't know if I need to take a look at what else is going on.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
This is the part that's the problem okay.  And they're being a little bit more stringent with us.  Cannot walk 200 feet without stopping to rest does no longer qualify them for disability.

PATIENT G101
I see.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
So I don't think because you can walk okay.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
Right?

PATIENT G101
Right.  @@@.

DOCTOR G101
Yeah but I don't think unless there is one of the following conditions okay.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
Lung disease which I don't think you have.

PATIENT G101
No.

DOCTOR G101
Alright.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
Right uh you don't have a heart condition.

PATIENT G101
Right.

DOCTOR G101
Uh you walk on your own; you don't have an assistive device.  You don't have @@@ or orthopedic condition that's severe right.  So I don't know if you necessarily qualify.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
Alright.  Let's hope you don't.

PATIENT G101
@@@.

DOCTOR G101
Alright, hold on one second okay.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:35  DOCTOR IN:  63:47)

DOCTOR G101
Alright.

PATIENT G101
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G101
Yeah so I think what we're gonna do, because your blood sugars are so high in the morning, in the 200s.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
We want to increase your nighttime insulin.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
Okay.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
So we're going to increase it from 20 to 25.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
You know what you need to do if you feel low blood sugars right?

PATIENT G101
Yes.

DOCTOR G101
I want you to then come down.  If you get low blood sugars in the morning.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
I want you to come down back to 20.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
Alright.  So you're gonna be taking Glargine 20.

PATIENT G101
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G101
And then the long-acting.  At night, tell me what you're taking, tell me what you're gonna be taking.

PATIENT G101
@@@ 24.

DOCTOR G101
Yep.

PATIENT G101
And @@@ 24, then 25 at bedtime.

DOCTOR G101
Alright.

PATIENT G101
Yeah.

DOCTOR G101
Good.

PATIENT G101
Good.

DOCTOR G101
Today you're gonna go to the Lab.

PATIENT G101
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G101
You're gonna get a couple lab tests.

PATIENT G101
Okay.

DOCTOR G101
And then I'm going to put in for the colonoscopy okay.

PATIENT G101
Okay.  When will I see you again?

DOCTOR G101
Uh you want to come back in a couple of months?  That sound okay?

PATIENT G101
Yeah.  @@@ pharmacy doctor.

DOCTOR G101
DOCTOR.  Uh it's just very helpful if I could have that.

PATIENT G101

DOCTOR G101
Okay.  Are you taking aspirin?

PATIENT G101
Yes.

PATIENT G101
No.

DOCTOR G101
Are you, you are taking insulin, diabetic medication yeah.

PATIENT G101

Okay.

DOCTOR G101
