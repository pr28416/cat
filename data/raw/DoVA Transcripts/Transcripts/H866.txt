PATIENT H866
Oh.

DOCTOR H866
But uh it’s okay, we'll just put that you've been having all this pain and what not.

PATIENT H866
It's not way too early is it?

DOCTOR H866
No.  It's like a few months.

PATIENT H866
Okay.

DOCTOR H866
So it won't really make a difference.

PATIENT H866
Yeah.  Because you know when I had it done the first time, she said they found two something and they cut them off.

DOCTOR H866
Yep and that's why you have to have it done five years later so that one was about five years ago.  Um and then I saw so you went and got you hearing aids.

PATIENT H866
Yeah I got one hearing aid.

DOCTOR H866
How's that so uh they did find anything wrong.  Cause I remember the last time your hearing.

PATIENT H866
That's because some of my hearing is lost in the left ear.

DOCTOR H866
That is, well I'm glad that you have that for your left one.

PATIENT H866
I forgot it.

DOCTOR H866
Oh.  Well you can hear me, sound good.

PATIENT H866
Okay.

DOCTOR H866
Why don't you sit up here I'll take a listen to you.

PATIENT H866
Uh.

DOCTOR H866
Deep breath.  

PATIENT H866
I got what they did with my naval.  I had um.

DOCTOR H866
I'm going to have you lay back.

PATIENT H866
What's that operation?

DOCTOR H866
Hernia.

PATIENT H866
Umbilical.

DOCTOR H866
Yeah.

PATIENT H866
And sometime there be something running out of it.

DOCTOR H866
But does it go back in?

PATIENT H866
Yeah.

DOCTOR H866
That's okay.

PATIENT H866
Okay.  I got one more thing.

DOCTOR H866
Yep.

PATIENT H866
I got a cough.

DOCTOR H866
Okay.

PATIENT H866
At night I have a real bad cough.  It just started a couple days ago.

DOCTOR H866
Have you been using your inhalers?  Okay, does it help?  Probably your asthma with changing of the season.

PATIENT H866
Yeah that's what I was thinking.

DOCTOR H866
Usually nighttime cough, that's what it is.

PATIENT H866
Yeah it's bad.

DOCTOR H866
Yeah.  Um you're just taking the albuterol now right?

PATIENT H866
Um I don't know they gave me something.  I was taking.

DOCTOR H866
Formoterol are you using that too?

PATIENT H866
No they gave me just one.

DOCTOR H866
Formoterol with mometasone?

PATIENT H866
Nope.

DOCTOR H866
No steroids?

PATIENT H866
I was taking it but she gave me this one that replaced that.  Instead of taking both of them she said it's just one.

DOCTOR H866
Yeah that's one.  Uh I don't know the name of it.  It's the two things in one.  But it's a steroid, you been using that?

PATIENT H866
Yeah.

DOCTOR H866
How long has the cough been going on?

PATIENT H866
About three days.

DOCTOR H866
Okay.  And I think maybe we should just let it ride out for a little bit. With the season, I don’t think changing the medicines is gonna do much.  I'm pretty sure it's probably the asthma so I think you just have to give it a little bit of time.  If it gets worse we can maybe try changing the medicines.  I think with only three days we don't really want to do anything aggressive and then have you on too much medicine.

PATIENT H866
Okay.

DOCTOR H866
Does that sound okay?  Your lungs sound good.  You're not wheezing or anything like that so.  Um and you haven't had a prostate exam yet or anything like that have you?  Uh uh.

PATIENT H866
I thought the colonoscopy and the prostate is different?

DOCTOR H866
Yeah the colon, the prostate is a different uh.

PATIENT H866
I never have done it.

DOCTOR H866
We can do a blood test to look for that.

PATIENT H866
Okay.

DOCTOR H866
Um and then.

PATIENT H866
I don't know I took a blood test.  Oh you already took it.

DOCTOR H866
Do what?  You had a blood test.

PATIENT H866
Yeah.

DOCTOR H866
Yeah it looked at um, it looked at your, we want to look at your lipids, your cholesterol.  You haven't had that for a while so um.  Alright well let me go talk with DOCTOR to see if he has any other thoughts about things to change and you're not taking anything for your cholesterol are you?

PATIENT H866
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR H866
Okay.  We might need to go up on one of these blood pressure pills cause it looks like the last time you were here it was a little high.

PATIENT H866
Yeah.

DOCTOR H866
So maybe we'll go up on your amlodipine um, so we'll go ask him okay.  I'll be right back.  Everything else looks great.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:11  DOCTOR IN:  37:18)

DOCTOR H866
Alright.  Everything he said looks good.  We'll just do blood tests today.  We'll go up on the amlodipine and um.

PATIENT H866
Um could you put in um a what do you call it?  A consult for me to go to the gym or the Wellness Center?

DOCTOR H866
Yeah, I can, sure um.

PATIENT H866
Cause I haven't been in a couple of weeks so I might be out of the.

DOCTOR H866
