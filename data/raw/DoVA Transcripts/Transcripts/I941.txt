PATIENT I941
You had it.

DOCTOR I941
Oh no it's okay.

PATIENT I941
@@@ now friend.  @@@.

DOCTOR I941
I want to listen to it and see.  Remember the last time you were here we talked about how this was the first time coming to the doctor it was kind of a new thing for you.

PATIENT I941
Right.

DOCTOR I941
So it kind of takes some time to get used to all of the medications and how to take them and all that stuff.

PATIENT I941
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I941
But what I want you to remember is you don't feel sick but you have a very sick heart and you have a sick body and you need to take the medications seriously, so as long as you understand that you need to make sure you review your medication list and you take them as it's written.  Are you taking the medication called Plavix?  The one they told you to stop because of the foot surgery?

PATIENT I941
Hmm.  I think it's called Plavix or another name for it.

DOCTOR I941
Clopidogrel?

PATIENT I941
Yes.

DOCTOR I941
Yeah did you stop that one like you were supposed to?

PATIENT I941
Yes.

DOCTOR I941
Okay are you taking your aspirin yeah?

PATIENT I941
Yes.

DOCTOR I941
You restarted the.

PATIENT I941
Started taking it again.

DOCTOR I941
Okay good but no Plavix, no clopidogrel.

PATIENT I941
You told me to stop taking that.

DOCTOR I941
Good.  Are you having any problems with your medications or do you have any questions about them?

PATIENT I941
No.

DOCTOR I941
Now the medications were the main thing I was worried about last time and again what's the most important thing in terms of how your health is doing?  Do you remember what we talked about?

PATIENT I941
No.

DOCTOR I941
You don't remember?

PATIENT I941
And I'm not drinking anymore.

DOCTOR I941
That was one of the big ones was the drinking.

PATIENT I941
Yeah I stopped drinking.

DOCTOR I941
And then other big one was uh your heart.

PATIENT I941
My heart.

DOCTOR I941
So you understand it right.

PATIENT I941
Right I can't do no more exercising, no @@@ stuff like that?

DOCTOR I941
So you still do that?

PATIENT I941
Yeah.

DOCTOR I941
Okay.

PATIENT I941
My blood pressure is back to, what was it 135 is what it was.

DOCTOR I941
Yeah and for you.

PATIENT I941
It was 180 at one time, I remember that.

DOCTOR I941
Do you know what your goal blood pressure should be?

PATIENT I941
No.

DOCTOR I941
So because you have heart disease, now when I say heart disease I was talking about the blockages in your heart.

PATIENT I941
Right.

DOCTOR I941
Because you had that, your goal blood pressure should be 120 on the top and 80 on the bottom and you're about that right now.

PATIENT I941
135 yeah.  I thought, I asked the lady and she said that's normal.

DOCTOR I941
She didn't know you had all these other, it's normal for somebody who doesn't have heart disease.

PATIENT I941
Normal for normal people.

DOCTOR I941
Yeah but you're not normal anymore.

PATIENT I941
I ain't normal man.

DOCTOR I941
So we don't mean it in a bad way we mean it in just the, that way we identify you as somebody we need to take close care of.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
So your heart doesn't get you.

PATIENT I941
Yeah.

DOCTOR I941
Does that make sense?

PATIENT I941
Yeah.

DOCTOR I941
I'm not saying your abnormal to make you feel bad.  We just say that you don't have a normal heart anymore; you have blockages in the arteries and that.

PATIENT I941
What causing it?  The food I eat?

DOCTOR I941
The food you eat, the cholesterol you have, high blood pressure, all those things combined.

PATIENT I941
Blocks the heart.

DOCTOR I941
Yeah.  So.

PATIENT I941
Exercise don't help?

DOCTOR I941
It does help but it doesn't take away all the other problems.

PATIENT I941
Hmm.  Okay.

DOCTOR I941
It builds up over time.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
So you've stopped drinking all together?

PATIENT I941
Yeah.

DOCTOR I941
Wow, that's very good.

PATIENT I941
Well I'd say coming from me that is good.

DOCTOR I941
When was your last drink?

PATIENT I941
About two months ago.

DOCTOR I941
You didn't have any problems trying to go back to the bottle or wanting to drink more?

PATIENT I941
Hmm.  I tell you what, I don't want any more, cause I quit drinking before.

DOCTOR I941
Good, good.

PATIENT I941
@@@.

DOCTOR I941
Cause the liver, it's gonna cause you a lot of trouble.

PATIENT I941
Cause that's @@@ when I worked.

DOCTOR I941
Okay and you're not working?

PATIENT I941
No.

DOCTOR I941
Okay.  How about smoking are you smoking?

PATIENT I941
No.

DOCTOR I941
Are you exercising still?

PATIENT I941
Hmm.  It normal, nothing more.

DOCTOR I941
You walk up and down flights of stairs?

PATIENT I941
Yes.

DOCTOR I941
How many stairs do you go up at night?

PATIENT I941
I go up two flights.

DOCTOR I941
Do you have any problems with chest pain?

PATIENT I941
Sometimes shortness of breath, sometimes pain you know, it stops me, I get dizzy, lightheaded.

DOCTOR I941
@@@

PATIENT I941
I think that my blood pressure.  Do you get dizzy.

DOCTOR I941
Uh this also could be from the heart.

PATIENT I941
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR I941
The blood pressure has to be really low to give you those symptoms.

PATIENT I941
To make you dizzy?

DOCTOR I941
Yeah.

PATIENT I941
My blood pressure is high.

DOCTOR I941
Exactly, I don't know if that's it.

PATIENT I941
Yeah.  But if I exercise or over exercise I get dizzy.

DOCTOR I941
Okay.

PATIENT I941
And I get dizzy and I stop.

DOCTOR I941
Do you have it every time you go up the stairs?

PATIENT I941
Not all the time, just if I overdo it you know.

DOCTOR I941
Now since they put that stent in your heart, has it become less frequent?  Do you notice you're doing better since then or is it the same?

PATIENT I941
The same. The same. I did notice I get the dizziness sometimes after @@@ short winded.  

DOCTOR I941
Alright.  What other questions do you have for me today, sir?

PATIENT I941
None.

DOCTOR I941
None.  Do you remember um the last time you were here you also told me you were having some problems with peeing at night and um you know you were going to the bathroom pretty frequently and we talked about it.

PATIENT I941
No that stopped.

DOCTOR I941
That stopped?

PATIENT I941
Yeah I don't have to go to the bathroom frequently.

DOCTOR I941
Oh when did that happen?

PATIENT I941
No, I don't know I don't know what to say, I just don't go.  I don't think @@@ I sleep good.

DOCTOR I941
Well you could probably try to get pension or disability.

PATIENT I941
That's what I'm trying to do.

DOCTOR I941
Do you need to pick up the forms for that?

PATIENT I941
I went to Social Security @@@ to try and get that.

DOCTOR I941
What did they say?

PATIENT I941
I got to get records from here.

DOCTOR I941
So if you go to the Business Medical Office they give you all your records I think it's the Regional Office just across the street.

PATIENT I941

DOCTOR I941
Right and they can give you all the stuff to take to Social Security.  Okay.  And if you have questions you can always come back and ask me how I can help.

DOCTOR I941
Alright listen.  I'll explain it to you like this; you can watch these football games while you have beers.

PATIENT I941

DOCTOR I941
But you'll probably watch football games for a couple more years.

PATIENT I941
Oh okay.

DOCTOR I941
Alright. 

PATIENT I941
I'm not gonna get too worried.

DOCTOR I941
Or you can watch 20 years of football games without the beer.

SECOND PERSON I941

SECOND PERSON I941

DOCTOR I941
Alright you were telling me you're gonna look into getting disability and Social Security. Yh so @@@ good and then we talked last time what is your combat history?  

PATIENT I941

DOCTOR I941
Where were you at?

PATIENT I941
Vietnam, Germany.  Do you to know exactly @@@?

DOCTOR I941
No that's fine.

PATIENT I941
Munich, Dachau, the whole of Germany.

DOCTOR I941
And you were in Vietnam.

PATIENT I941
Oh man @@@ I saw @@@

SECOND PERSON I941
@@@.

PATIENT I941
I @@@ we were digging holes laying in the ground.

SECOND PERSON I941
Wow.

PATIENT I941
@@@.

DOCTOR I941
The reason why I was asking you was I was wanting to know if any of that stuff with you wanting to drink and stuff like that.  Do you ever have flashbacks?

PATIENT I941
Oh plenty of them yeah, plenty of them.

DOCTOR I941
@@@.

PATIENT I941
@@@ about that.  All that stuff in Vietnam.

DOCTOR I941
What do you think about your old days of partying and the fact that now you're 59 and you have blockages in your heart and a bad liver.

PATIENT I941
I have to slow down the party you know.

DOCTOR I941
That’s all I want to hear.

PATIENT I941
Slow down that party.

DOCTOR I941
You understand that right?

PATIENT I941
@@@.  Yeah I still going around peaking at parties you know and what's been going on, man I'm giving it a little break, that's the end of the conversation.  That's @@@ alright.  I'm not drinking right now.

DOCTOR I941
Did you get your colonoscopy yet?

PATIENT I941
Is that where they put you in the MRI @@@.

DOCTOR I941
Uh MRI.

PATIENT I941
MRI.

DOCTOR I941
No the colonoscopy is the one where.

PATIENT I941
You get to drink all this stuff.

DOCTOR I941
Yeah.

PATIENT I941
Yeah I did that yeah.

DOCTOR I941
But they said they were going to schedule it but I don't think they did it did they?

PATIENT I941
Yeah they did it.

DOCTOR I941
When?

PATIENT I941
I think it was a colonoscopy?  They put me in a MRI and.

DOCTOR I941
No.

PATIENT I941
I drank a lot of stuff.

DOCTOR I941
Oh that's something different yeah.

PATIENT I941
PET, @@@ on the first floor.

DOCTOR I941
No that's another one, that's something different.  The colonoscopy is they make a drink a prep overnight that makes you poop all night long cleans out your entire bowels and then they put you to sleep while they put a camera in your rectum and they look for cancers in your intestines.  You have not had that.  I think people remember that.

PATIENT I941
Yeah.

DOCTOR I941
@@@.  I think they talked to you about it in the GI and explained to you that the reason why they want to do it is uh everyone is supposed to have one at the age of 50 okay.  It's a screening for colon cancer.

PATIENT I941
Right.

DOCTOR I941
And the reason why we do it is because colon cancer is one of the few cancers that if you catch it, while it's still like a little small couple of cells that are growing in your intestines we can see we cut it out and its gone and we just have to do a follow-up test later.  If we don't look for it, we don't catch it and it becomes a cancer and grows into the stomach, goes through the walls of the colon, just through the walls of the colon and then it goes to other places.  Once it spreads past the colon.

PATIENT I941
What does the colon do anyhow?

DOCTOR I941
The colon is the large intestines, that's all it is.

PATIENT I941
Hmm.

DOCTOR I941
The large intestines.

PATIENT I941
Pancreas.

DOCTOR I941
Pancreas is different.  That helps you digest food.  The colon helps you pass the food out and makes stool but that's the second highest form of cancer Americans get.

PATIENT I941
Hmm.

DOCTOR I941
Okay.  The only thing more than that is lung cancer.  

PATIENT I941
Yes.

DOCTOR I941
But the colon cancer is the only one we can actually look at, cut out and stop it before it becomes a cancer.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
So they wanted to do it but then they got worried that you were on that blood thinner.

PATIENT I941
Right, right, right.

DOCTOR I941
So now that you've stopped it, I think we should probably have you go back and get that done, what do you think?

PATIENT I941
Yes.

DOCTOR I941
You'll go for it?

PATIENT I941
Yes.  In order to get a lot of years.  I love my Sci Fi.  @@@.  Comic books, science fiction.

DOCTOR I941
What kind of comic books?

SECOND PERSON I941
@@@.

PATIENT I941
@@@.  Flash Gordon, @@@.  Doctor Who.

DOCTOR I941
@@@.  Um your blood pressure's better um but we need to get it even lower by you know the next time you come.

PATIENT I941
Will I still be breathing?

DOCTOR I941
Well do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?

PATIENT I941
No.

DOCTOR I941
Do you want to pick up one today so that we can actually have you check your blood pressures at home?

PATIENT I941
I can check my own blood pressure?

DOCTOR I941
Yeah you just put a cuff on your arm, press the button and the machine reads it up to you.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
And that way, actually bring it when you come in.

PATIENT I941
So what happens if it's too high or too low?

DOCTOR I941
I want you to write it down.

PATIENT I941
Call 911.

DOCTOR I941
No.  I want you to write them down and the next time you come see me bring in the sheet of the blood pressures you wrote down.

PATIENT I941
I take the blood every day?

DOCTOR I941
One in the morning and one in the evening.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
Do it for like two weeks and then write them down and bring them in.  Cause if something like you know if your blood pressure's like 140/90 that's not good enough but you're like but here it shows every day I'm 120/80 at home, maybe I just don't like you and that's why my blood pressure goes up.  We'll leave it at that and we won't change your medications.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
But if you’re continuously high then we need to change it.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
The same thing, when you come to see, we'll reschedule the Pharmacy visit.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
When you come in to see the pharmacist uh.

PATIENT I941
You going to reschedule that for me?

DOCTOR I941
Yeah, so when you come in to see her, she can actually even look at the blood pressure medications, blood pressures and decide what we need to give you.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
And she'll just put it under my name.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
So why don't we pick up a blood pressure cuff today.

PATIENT I941
I can get that today.

DOCTOR I941
Yeah and then once we get that going, for the next two weeks write down your blood pressures and we'll move your Pharmacy visit back two weeks.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
Sound okay.

PATIENT I941
Okay.

DOCTOR I941
Um now let me try to remember where you get your blood pressure.

PATIENT I941
What about my cholesterol?  We didn't say anything about that, the results of the blood test.  I took about 100 gallon of blood for a while.

DOCTOR I941
@@@ vampires.

PATIENT I941
Hey.

DOCTOR I941
@@@.

PATIENT I941
What's going on.  I thought @@@.

DOCTOR I941
So you could get your blood pressure cuff today, yeah we'll get that.

PATIENT I941
Hmm.

DOCTOR I941
@@@ take off your jacket, how am I supposed to @@@.

PATIENT I941
It’s Chicago, man?

SECOND PERSON I941
You must be warm out there.  How many more layers do you put on when you're cold?

PATIENT I941
Because I'm working, when I'm working I don't do all that stuff.

DOCTOR I941
You want to know about.

PATIENT I941
This is Chicago.

DOCTOR I941
You know you got to.

PATIENT I941
@@@ wait five minutes.

DOCTOR I941
Alright let me tell you something too about this.

PATIENT I941
Alright.

DOCTOR I941
Your hepatitis.

PATIENT I941
Yeah what about it.

DOCTOR I941
They were going to talk to you about whether to talk about treatment and whether or not to treat you for your hepatitis C.

PATIENT I941
I need my liver out.

DOCTOR I941
No we're not taking your liver out.

SECOND PERSON I941
That wouldn't work too well I don't think.

PATIENT I941
They deliver, @@@.

DOCTOR I941
Okay.

PATIENT I941
