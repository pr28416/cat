Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR R458
How you sir?

PATIENT R458
Oh, my heels, my knee.

DOCTOR R458
What's going on?

PATIENT R458
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
Somebody said this might be arthritis.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.

PATIENT R458
@@@.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
My heel now when I get up in the morning for the last, I'd say almost month.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
When I wake up in the morning my heels are bothering me.

DOCTOR R458
Your heel?

PATIENT R458
Yeah.

DOCTOR R458
Which one the right heel?

PATIENT R458
Right heel.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.

PATIENT R458
And then after I walk around a while.

DOCTOR R458
It goes away.

PATIENT R458
It feels better.

DOCTOR R458
You may have a spur down there.

PATIENT R458
That's what they were saying.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah.

PATIENT R458
What is a spur?

DOCTOR R458
So a spur is basically an extra bone growth um.  It could have been arthritis.  You know when you get, what happens with arthritis is you get inflammation.

PATIENT R458
Alright.

DOCTOR R458
And the bones sort of react to that inflammation with age and it kind of grows and we get spurs.  So basically it's like extra bone growth in there.

PATIENT R458
Like that.

DOCTOR R458
Um does it hurt when you push on the heel?

PATIENT R458
No I mean, like I said after I get up.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
Like the first time I.

DOCTOR R458
Sure.

PATIENT R458
Actually @@@ prostrate have to get up three or four times a night.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
Okay I haven't been asleep for about three or four hours.

DOCTOR R458
Right.

PATIENT R458
The first time I get up.

DOCTOR R458
You feel pain in that heel.

PATIENT R458
Yeah if I got to get up I go again but after that it @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.

PATIENT R458
And you know I know its there.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah.

PATIENT R458
But it's not as severe as it is when I first get up.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.  Um we'll take a look at it and see.  Um now you saw the GI doctors and they said everything was okay um from your stomach, you know from the perspective of your stomach.  No more black stools or anything?  Okay.  Um and then now I understand that you decided didn't want to take the Coumadin?

PATIENT R458
Uh that's what I had when I you know I got sick you know.

DOCTOR R458
Right.

PATIENT R458
Before that blood and everything.

DOCTOR R458
Right, right.

PATIENT R458
Uh.

DOCTOR R458
Well the reason you bled is because you had an ulcer.

PATIENT R458
@@@.

DOCTOR R458
You know so the blood thinner has made it worse because you had the ulcer and then you, because you had blood thinners it made the bleeding worse.

PATIENT R458
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R458
Uh the only thing to sort of understand is, you know that arrhythmia you have, that atrial fibrillation that A fib.

PATIENT R458
Yeah.

DOCTOR R458
You know where your heart doesn't go regular.

PATIENT R458
Right.

DOCTOR R458
So you're at increased risk for developing blood clots because of that irregular rhythm okay.  So if you, I mean aspirin helps some but not as much as the Coumadin does and so what happens is if you're not on the Coumadin you're at a higher risk of developing blood clots cause your heart doesn't pump like a regular heart.

PATIENT R458
Right.

DOCTOR R458
Sometimes it does this sort of shaky thing and that can set you up for blood clots and the thing with that is that it can increase your risks of having a stroke because the blood clots can go from your heart and shoot up into your brain you know so that's why we recommend that you be on Coumadin.  We stopped the Coumadin when you had your bleeding episode because you were actively bleeding.  You know you had that ulcer but now that the ulcer has healed uh you could go back on Coumadin.  The decision is up to you but I want you to understand what the risks and benefits are.

PATIENT R458
Okay and um like the dosage, she gave me what, I was on 5 mg.

DOCTOR R458
Right.

PATIENT R458
I think they wanted me to go to 5 1/2.

DOCTOR R458
Right.

PATIENT R458
So that's when I started having problems.

DOCTOR R458
I mean what we, cause when they adjust the doses it's based on the blood tests and we want your level, that INR level, we want it between 2 and 3 so they adjust the dose based on the levels.  But I want you to understand that the Coumadin doesn't cause the bleeding, it's the ulcer that caused the bleeding, it's just that the Coumadin made it worse because you were on a blood thinner.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
You know so unless you have an ulcer or something like an ulcer you know the Coumadin should not cause you to bleed like that.  It's just that you had an ulcer you know.  Uh you know the decision's up to you but.

PATIENT R458
Oh I, if you recommend it I'll.

DOCTOR R458
I would recommend it because I think you're a pretty functional guy and you're 70 years old and your annual risk of having a stroke when you have that atrial fibrillation is 2% okay.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
So you know I think, now you can see, you know it’s one of those things.  If you start the Coumadin, if you start @@@ we got to figure out why you know.

PATIENT R458
Right.

DOCTOR R458
Or if you start having bleeding, we'll stop it you know and then but you did have this one episode, we treated it.  We treated the ulcer um so the ulcer is healed and so now we can see if you know.

PATIENT R458
Like I say, if you recommend it I can go along with it as far as the you know.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah.

PATIENT R458
I want to protect my health you know.

DOCTOR R458
Right you know I think a stroke is no small thing, you know.

PATIENT R458
Yeah I know, I know.

DOCTOR R458
@@@.

PATIENT R458
@@@.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah oh yeah.

PATIENT R458
Yeah my brother had a stroke and my father had a stroke so you know.

DOCTOR R458
And do have some limited mobility from it?

PATIENT R458
Well my brother, well my father passed and my brother yeah he's @@@ walk.

DOCTOR R458
Right, you know so that's why we you know sort of push for it.

PATIENT R458
Yeah you know that's what I'm saying I.

DOCTOR R458
And you know we'll see if things, if things um, your blood levels got a lot better.  They checked your blood in March and your blood levels were significantly better than they were you know a few months ago so um.  Let me see here.  Are you still taking the iron or did you stop taking the iron?

PATIENT R458
No I stopped taking the iron.

DOCTOR R458
Okay, alright.  Your cholesterol was checked in December and your cholesterol looked good.  When did you stop the iron?

PATIENT R458
Uh it's been like 30 days.  I had a 30 day supply and I used them up and @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Okay, okay.

PATIENT R458
Because you said that I had another blood test.

DOCTOR R458
Right, right.

PATIENT R458
@@@.

DOCTOR R458
Um okay.  And your blood pressure looks good today and your diabetes looked good the last time we checked it.  Still like to check it you know before our next visit when you come back in three months.  We should probably check it before then, the diabetes, just to make sure its still under control.

PATIENT R458
Me or you?

DOCTOR R458
You.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah.

PATIENT R458
I can do that.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah um and then did you see the eye doctor this year?

PATIENT R458
Yeah I @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Oh okay, @@@ February, the clinic okay.

PATIENT R458
@@@.

DOCTOR R458
Oh okay.

PATIENT R458
I go there @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Okay so have you been gaining weight?

PATIENT R458
Yeah I was wondering if can't be some of the medicine I'm taking.  Cause my appetite is @@@ for some reason.

DOCTOR R458
Well part of it may be, part of it, you know you have been gaining some weight over the past year and a half here.

PATIENT R458
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR R458
Part of it may be that if you have your diabetes under better control, you know normally if your sugars are too high you can pee out the sugar.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
So when you get, you take your medicines and you get your diabetes under better control you actually absorb the sugar in your body and then that can make you gain weight.  So, actually having your diabetes under good control, which you do and you seem that you do, you actually can gain weight. So, the way you can help that is you have to exercise more and watch what you eat more.

PATIENT R458
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R458
But how has your diet been?

PATIENT R458
Well just uh.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
My appetite, I don't know, I seem like I be hungry all the time @@@.  I know but lately it's like uh and I told my wife, she's small.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
But she's been trying to gain weight.

DOCTOR R458
Oh.

PATIENT R458
And she's having to cook a lot of food and I don't like to waste food you know she's giving it to the dog and he's getting bigger and I'm getting bigger.

DOCTOR R458
Well you've got to, clearly your wife should take a bigger portion and you need to take a smaller portion.  Um okay.  Uh I mean you know we also have the MOVE Program here.  I don't know if you've been offered that before.

PATIENT R458
Yeah.  Actually I have a lot to do all day.  Like I said my wife she's been sick.

DOCTOR R458
@@@ going on?

PATIENT R458
She's got cancer.

DOCTOR R458
Oh that's why she's losing all this weight.

PATIENT R458
Right yeah.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.  Breast cancer or?

PATIENT R458
No, no, she's got a lung cancer.

DOCTOR R458
Lung cancer.

PATIENT R458
She's a big smoker.

DOCTOR R458
Oh I see okay, alright.  So that's why she's trying to gain weight and eat a lot.

PATIENT R458
Yeah she feels like, but she can't walk now.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
She lost @@@.

DOCTOR R458
I see uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
She can't walk so I have to get her up you know.

DOCTOR R458
Sure, sure.

PATIENT R458
Do what I can do you know.  @@@. It’s just the two of us.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.  I think then what we need to work on to start with is the diet at least because that's when you can control, you know you can control your portions at least.

PATIENT R458
Yeah.

DOCTOR R458
You know.  Um let me ask you, what uh, you were saying that you have to get up three or four times a night to go to the bathroom, the prostate is still bothering you?

PATIENT R458
See but I drink a lot of fluid like uh, Crystal Light you know I drink a gallon.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
Of water and put Crystal Light in it and @@@ most of the food I eat is @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.  I know that we tried that one prostate medicine but it made you a little bit dizzy.

PATIENT R458
I think I was taking it twice, now I only take it once.

DOCTOR R458
You're still taking the prostate medicine? Tamsulosin?

PATIENT R458
Yeah I take it.

DOCTOR R458
You take it once, okay you're taking it.

PATIENT R458
I take it once at night.

DOCTOR R458
But it hasn't really helped that much?  Has it helped at all?

PATIENT R458
Well like I said you know, cause you know the water I take in, you know I don't have no problems urinating and stuff like that you know.  It doesn't bother me; it's just that now I held, I had to go to the washroom when I first came over here.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah.

PATIENT R458
And I hold it just because I might have to go to the you know.

DOCTOR R458
Right catch stuff right.

PATIENT R458
@@@.  It doesn't bother me, it just the fact that I know that I'm gonna have to get up two or three times a night.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.

PATIENT R458
That's when I'm drinking water you know like Crystal Light.

DOCTOR R458
Alright so if you don't drink the water you don't have to get up?

PATIENT R458
Yeah, I find out what I drink, anything like a pop or something, like a soda, I don't have to get up @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Okay, well you know, the other thing that I would suggest is that you don’t drink anything, like too much a couple hours before you go to bed.

PATIENT R458
Yeah.

DOCTOR R458
And that will probably let you get a better night's sleep because you don't have to get up three or four times a night.

PATIENT R458
Yeah, I had an appetite for water and so.

DOCTOR R458
Oh yeah that's good.  Drinking water is good, it helps your diabetes.  It helps a lot of different things.

PATIENT R458
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R458
But maybe just cutting back late at night before you go to bed.

PATIENT R458
Right, right.

DOCTOR R458
You know um and then how, any problems with your hernia?

PATIENT R458
No that's still the same you know.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.

PATIENT R458
I don't, you know.  As long as I @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Okay, alright.  So why don't you take a look, I'm going to take a look.  Why don't you take off your shoes, I'll be back in a few minutes, we'll take a look at it okay.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
And which knee is it that's bothering you?

PATIENT R458
Uh both, this right here.

DOCTOR R458
Right in here?

PATIENT R458
But this one is worse.

DOCTOR R458
Okay can you kick in and kick out for me?

PATIENT R458
I can do all that.  But it @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
I got a @@@ stops me from running.  This one hurts too at night.

DOCTOR R458
Go in and out for me.

PATIENT R458
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R458
See you have a little bit of what we call crepitus there which may signal arthritis.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
What is, has this been going on for a while or is it kind of getting worse?

PATIENT R458
Well like I said this just started.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R458
In a month.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.

PATIENT R458
And this one started @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.

PATIENT R458
You know that @@@ all that stuff @@@.  So then lately this one started too, giving me trouble too so @@@.

DOCTOR R458
I wonder if you have enough arch support in your shoes.

PATIENT R458
I got those @@@ shoes.  @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah.  I wonder if maybe, let me talk to DOCTOR cause maybe we could send you to Podiatry to see if you can get some good inserts.

PATIENT R458
I got those Dr. Scholl's you know.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah.  But they can give you ones that will actually fit for your foot.

PATIENT R458
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
Uh that might be something that might be helpful.  Let me, because that might help.

PATIENT R458
@@@.

DOCTOR R458
@@@.

PATIENT R458
@@@.  Right there.

DOCTOR R458
Oh here?

PATIENT R458
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R458
When I push there does it hurt?

PATIENT R458
Yeah it hurt but I just you know.

DOCTOR R458
That's where it is, so that's where it hurts.

PATIENT R458
Right yeah, uh-huh.  I'd say too like when you drive when your foot stays like this all the time, I @@@.

DOCTOR R458
Yeah no that could be it too, if you're pushing on the nerve there.

PATIENT R458
You know and driving.

DOCTOR R458
How is it when you sleep, how are you positioned?  What is your foot positioned like when you sleep?  Cause you @@@ if it's only happening mostly when you wake up in the morning if your foot is being positioned at night in a way that is pushing on a nerve or something.  Something to pay attention to.

PATIENT R458
@@@.

DOCTOR R458
You can try, you know you can put a pillow underneath your leg at night just to see what happens.

PATIENT R458
Yeah.

DOCTOR R458
Provide it some cushioning it and even that might help and you know we have nerves and veins and stuff everywhere in our body.  There may be a nerve there that's being pushed on.

PATIENT R458
@@@ that's what I'm saying I thought maybe from me driving all these years from my foot being like that.

DOCTOR R458
That's possible.

PATIENT R458
@@@.

DOCTOR R458
It's possible.  The other thing is that when you've got arthritis in the knees it can also affect the feet.

PATIENT R458
Really.

DOCTOR R458
It's not arthritis in your feet but it can also kind of mess with the way you walk.

PATIENT R458
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R458
And the way you know because you know you don't feel comfortable with your knees.  Let's say this knee was bothering you more and then you're putting more pressure on the right foot because the left knee is bothering you, you know.

PATIENT R458
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R458
Uh because there are lots of different things that can cause it.  I think one thing that, let me check @@@ I think one thing that might help is having good arch supports.

PATIENT R458
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R458
Under your feet and that might help them with the support and then you put a pillow under your heel at night and see if that helps when you get up in the morning okay.  Just sit up here.  I think your heart is regular.  So right now you're not in that atrial fibrillation rhythm.  Okay let me go talk to the boss and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  27:06  DOCTOR IN:  35:43)

DOCTOR R458
Alright sir.  I think, um I'd like to refer you to a podiatrist to see if they feel that you need any custom inserts for your shoes um and ask them to just take a look at your foot and see if they could find any cause of the pain that you're having there okay.

PATIENT R458
When today?

DOCTOR R458
No I'm gonna give you a referral today.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.  Um and then the last thing is in terms of restarting the Coumadin.  This is something that we want to monitor you closely when we restart it because we don't want what happened last time to happen again you know.  So what um you're gonna be following, I know you used to come and follow with the pharmacist, right with DOCTOR.

PATIENT R458
Right.

DOCTOR R458
So we're gonna have you follow with them um.  The other thing is that we probably, I'm going to give you a set of stool cards um and after you've been on the Coumadin for a couple weeks I want you to send in your stool in on the card okay.  So I just want to make sure that there's no further blood in the stool after you've been on the Coumadin.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.  Um and that way we can be sure that it's safe for you to be on the Coumadin.  You know that sort of risk benefit kind of thing here okay.  Alright just give me one second here.  And I'm going to put some labs in for three months from now okay.  So or well 2 1/2 months from now.  So if you could come in and get your blood tested maybe a week before you come for your appointment.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
Then we'll have all the labs when you come back in okay.

PATIENT R458
And I'm gonna need to you know update all my medicines.

DOCTOR R458
Right okay what do you need?  Uh do you know which meds you.

PATIENT R458
Well I don't know, you know some of them may have, you know @@@ the last time I get them.

DOCTOR R458
Uh-huh.  Sure.

PATIENT R458
You I want to make sure that I have them.

DOCTOR R458
That you have enough.

PATIENT R458
Yeah.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.  So @@@ at least three refills on I'm going to renew them.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
Okay.  Looking good.  You'll come back and see us, so I'm graduating come July 1st, so I don't think I'm gonna be seeing you anymore in this clinic.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
Um I'm working in the Diabetes Clinic upstairs starting in July um.  Let's see if there's anything here.  So they'll call you about the Coumadin Clinic.

PATIENT R458
Okay.

DOCTOR R458
So those are the guys getting in touch with you regarding setting that up uh and let me see if we've got those cards.  Okay let me walk out with you sir.  I'm gonna give you this to make your appointment.  Your medicines were renewed.  Um and you're gonna get some labs @@@.  I still need to get you some stool cards that you take with you @@@.  So @@@.  Yeah they're gonna mail the appointment to you.  You can make the Podiatry appointment right here in the front when you check out.

PATIENT R458
