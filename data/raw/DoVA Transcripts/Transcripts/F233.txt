And I'll decide on.  Do you have a blood pressure machine at home?

PATIENT F233
Not a blood pressure machine no I don't.

DOCTOR F233
No okay uh.  I would probably recommend you to get one.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
So that you know you can have the readings when you're at home.

PATIENT F233
Sure.

DOCTOR F233
Uh most of the times the readings at the hospitals are not the correct ones.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
Because you walk all the way down and then you know you are already on the stressful situation.

PATIENT F233
Sure.

DOCTOR F233
And then usually that bumps it up.

PATIENT F233
Okay, right.

DOCTOR F233
So the home readings are the most helpful.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
Uh and then uh.


PATIENT F233

For colon cancer for instance what we do is something called colonoscopy.

DOCTOR F233
It is a scope that we take it through your anus and out per your rectum and they can see the lining of your colon as part of how it is working.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233

PATIENT F233
Yeah I went down to.

DOCTOR F233
The other hospital.

PATIENT F233
It was at a yeah, at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.  Uh let's see, @@@ okay.  Um what I'm gonna do is we're @@@ discuss with my clinic supervisor.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
So we discussed about the @@@ and come up with a plan.

PATIENT F233
Yeah there's another thing, I have a doctor, I have a civilian doctor as well.  

DOCTOR F233
Okay.

PATIENT F233
They diagnosed me with asthma.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.

PATIENT F233
That just happened, I want to say probably a month ago.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.

PATIENT F233
They gave me a @@@.

DOCTOR F233
Albuterol?

PATIENT F233
It was the pink, the pink one.

DOCTOR F233
The pink one.

PATIENT F233
Yeah and I take it twice a day to control my asthma.

DOCTOR F233
Do you take even today, you take it on a daily basis?

PATIENT F233
Yeah twice a day.

DOCTOR F233
What happens exactly?

PATIENT F233
Oh what happened is I was wheezing and I couldn't breathe.

DOCTOR F233
When was that?  A month back?

PATIENT F233
About a month.  I came to the Emergency Room here when it was bothering me.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.

PATIENT F233
And I was coughing um severely.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
And I came to this Emergency Room and the lady gave me a regular bottle, not the one that they have but a red bottle instead.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
And um I take that and all it did was calm me down but they didn't do anything, anything tremendous for me.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
Then I went to my civilian doctor to find out why was I coughing so much.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
And I went to St. um, St. Agnes is it or St. Alexis.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
I went to St. Alexis and I did a pulmonary exam.  During my pulmonary exam I blanked out.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
Um so during that blank out the technician and the doctor said that they cannot continue the exam because I blanked out on the pulmonary exam.  I came over here to DOCTOR, down at Garfield.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.

PATIENT F233
At the VA Hospital and saw a doctor in there, and whatever his name, and he gave me, he was the pulmonary doctor he gave me an exam and he said he just checked it that I do have asthma.  DOCTOR was the doctor's name.

DOCTOR F233
So you came over here at the Emergency.

PATIENT F233
Yeah.

DOCTOR F233
That was June, is that correct?

PATIENT F233
Yep, that's right.  @@@ yep.

DOCTOR F233
Uh I don't see that in June @@@.

PATIENT F233
Was it June?

DOCTOR F233
@@@ inhalers?  Did they?

PATIENT F233
Yeah they gave me; um well they gave me something outta here.

DOCTOR F233
They gave you a nasal spray.  They gave you a spray to put in your nose?

PATIENT F233
Oh that's what they gave me?

DOCTOR F233
@@@.

PATIENT F233
Was that from the Emergency Room or was that from the doctor because I wasn't breathing good with my sleep um, with my CPAP machine?

DOCTOR F233
So @@@.  I don't see the reason why they gave you but that is what is here.  I don't see any uh.

PATIENT F233
Okay.  I mean you might be right, it's been a while but I came to the Emergency Room cause um a constant cold that wouldn't go away.

DOCTOR F233
I get that and they gave you some antibiotics for it.

PATIENT F233
There you go; they gave me some of that.

DOCTOR F233
Yeah.

PATIENT F233
So they, so I wasn't satisfied with the Emergency Room results here.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
And I was supposed to go to DOCTOR.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
And they did some more testing which I think the VA should have done it themselves.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
And they failed to do.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
And then the doctor I went to see was DOCTOR.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
Down at @@@ hospital.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
And he diagnosed me with um asthma.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.  Okay.  Uh, typically with asthma what we see is when we listen to your chest we see something called wheezing okay.

PATIENT F233
Yes that's what I was doing, that's right and that's what I was doing too.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.  Uh, did you have asthma in the past?

PATIENT F233
Never.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.  Let me tell you this story, okay, this is how it goes.  Uh, usually at your age @@@.  Most of the time the asthma is a @@@ of what happened during your childhood okay.  It is very rare for a person to have a new onset asthma at your age.

PATIENT F233
Right.

DOCTOR F233
Not impossible, it can happen but it is not usual.  In asthma what we hear is wheezing okay.  Many of the time, you have got an infection.  That also tends to relate to wheezing.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
And infection gets corrected and the moment the infection gets corrected the wheezing gets corrected.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
So the thought they treating you, they give you some dramatic relief with this wheezing okay.  So all wheezing need not be asthma.

PATIENT F233
Sure.

DOCTOR F233
But then you need to be @@@ and it was correct to start you on those medications.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
Today I am not able to hear any wheezing on your chest.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.  But on the days when you do do, you taking puffs on a regular basis.

PATIENT F233
Alright.

DOCTOR F233
Because if you do it on a regular basis then you might not be @@@ okay.

PATIENT F233
Yeah.

DOCTOR F233
So @@@ I'm not going to make a diagnosis of whether you have asthma or not.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.  Uh, what I will do is that we will uh, I will talk, I will discuss with my supervisor.

PATIENT F233
Alright.

DOCTOR F233
What would the plan be if we stopped the inhaler and can see how you do by stopping it and the moment you have the problems, you take the inhaler.

PATIENT F233
Hmm.

DOCTOR F233
They work there and then.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
So we can @@@ but how many times do you need to use that inhaler in a month okay?  If you need to take it more than once in a month, then you might need to consider reevaluating you for asthma.

PATIENT F233
But they never evaluated@@@.

DOCTOR F233
Yeah.  So we can go ahead and do that okay?

PATIENT F233
Fine.  That's what I'm saying.  I think, I feel.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
That the VA should of did further evaluation for that emergency result.

DOCTOR F233
Exactly.  With the kind of story you presented at the Emergency Room, Iâ€™m reading through your note, if I had been there, I would not have evaluated you for asthma. The reason being, first of all, asthma onset as an adult is very unusual   What we will do is @@@.

PATIENT F233
Sure, sure. 

DOCTOR F233
And if you have an infection and I think that we will, then we cannot evaluate for asthma.

PATIENT F233
Right cause you're treating an infection.

DOCTOR F233
Exactly.

PATIENT F233
Yeah, @@@.

DOCTOR F233
Yeah.

PATIENT F233
But after the infection.

DOCTOR F233
Yes.

PATIENT F233
I should get a follow-up.

DOCTOR F233
Yes.  After the infection you gonna get a follow-up provided okay and that is what I am doing now okay.  So let us do that way, if nobody diagnosed you with asthma, I would never do a function test on you, a pulmonary function test.

PATIENT F233
Right.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.  But now since somebody diagnosed you, let's make sure that what we are dealing with is actually correct or not.

PATIENT F233
Sure.

DOCTOR F233
@@@.  So you stop using the inhaler for now.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
Keep the inhaler only when you need it okay.

PATIENT F233
Alright.

DOCTOR F233
And then we count the times of how many times you need it, if you need it for more than one a month then we'll get you back over here and weâ€™ll evaluate you for asthma okay?  And then we'll do a pulmonary function test to get to see what kind of lung problems okay.  It may not be asthma, maybe something else @@@ do that, okay?

PATIENT F233
But based on, based on DOCTOR evaluation, another civilian doctor.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
Um and he determined that DOCTOR diagnosed me with asthma.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
Based on the other doctor's assessment, can you say then do a function test?  Can you talk to your supervisor.  Cause I myself would like to get a function test, so what I want to know, I don't want to wait another month or two months.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
That look at as BS.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
Or why, look I gotta do something, I gotta go back and not hear @@@.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.

PATIENT F233
I feel I got a problem and I want to rectify it.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.  What happens you believe the person @@@ asthma.

PATIENT F233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F233
Asthma is a disease that you already carry it, okay.  Even if you have an asthma okay, but asthma may have some problem only once a month okay.  So what happens is you'll be normal, asthma attack comes, you get into the situation that day and come back to normal, you remain normal and @@@ and then you get asthma.  That's how the attack of asthma comes okay.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
Now when you are normal.

PATIENT F233
Mine didn't come like that.

DOCTOR F233
How does it come.

PATIENT F233
If I'm, if I'm exerting myself.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
The asthma hits me.  If I'm doing exercise.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
Or I'm walking up the stairs, my asthma hits me.

DOCTOR F233
It hits you.

PATIENT F233
If I'm having sex with my wife, the asthma hits me.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.

PATIENT F233
And I'm tired of that.  I really am.

DOCTOR F233
Now.  This is another kind of asthma.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
This is the kind of asthma which call exercise-induced asthma okay.  Now if you have got these kinds of symptoms, then the best way to treat it is when you anticipate that you do the, @@@ when you are gonna get the asthma, is to take a puff before that okay.  That is typically what you do.  That's typically what you do right?

PATIENT F233
Iâ€™m laughing here because Iâ€™m in the middle of a sex problem here, with my wife.


DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
And here I'm getting an attack.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
Which it's, it's funny because I have to stop having my sex, intimate moment with my wife, it's just a problem.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F233
And it frustrates me that I can't continue this process.

DOCTOR F233
Exactly.

PATIENT F233
And you're telling me this way.  I'm saying I want the test, I want the test now.

DOCTOR F233
Okay.

PATIENT F233
I want to get it over with.  I'm frustrated.

DOCTOR F233
Uh-huh.  If you are on a normal day okay, if you're on a normal day when you get the test.

PATIENT F233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F233
It's gonna come normal okay.  This test is gonna be normal okay.  What we Iâ€™m trying.

PATIENT F233
How can you call me a date for a test when you don't know if day I'm going to have an attack or not?

DOCTOR F233
What we do is something called challenge test.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
Where we give you some medication which is gonna precipitate your asthma at that time at the Lab okay and then they'll do the test.  

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
But we'll see whether you are, whether there, it is a precipitating factor okay.  Now I just wonder since now I'm seeing you for the first time okay, let me try and to get that indication @@@ that you actually need it okay.  

PATIENT F233
Oh.

DOCTOR F233
A simple pulmonary function test is something which can be done anytime okay.  Challenge test is something which I can do it but that is what I'm just trying to and I'm going to analyze it but let me see how you do @@@ okay.  Now then if you need it we can schedule you on the phone and you can come out and have it okay.

PATIENT F233
Uh yeah that's cool.

DOCTOR F233
What I'm trying to do, the situation at this time is, you could stop the inhaler for now okay.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
If you do some kind of exercise and if you get short of breath at that time the next time what you do is even before you started the exercise, take that puff.  Even if you don't have symptoms.

PATIENT F233
Right.

DOCTOR F233
Now do the exercise.

PATIENT F233
Right.

DOCTOR F233
And we'll see if you get that symptoms again or not okay, okay.  If you don't get that symptoms then it gives me an idea that you are having so-called exercise-induced asthma and the only way how we control the exercise-induced asthma is by giving you medication prior to that exercise so it's not that you develop the symptoms and then you get the medication no.  If you feel that when you lift your boxes, you get asthma.

PATIENT F233
Alright.

DOCTOR F233
Then you, even before lifting the boxes you get a puff, do the exercise and @@@.

PATIENT F233
I'm not using the word exercise, anytime I walk up flights of stairs@@@.

DOCTOR F233
Exactly.

(Knock on the door)

PATIENT F233
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR F233
Well that is what I'm trying to prove to you at this time okay and I will try to, I will try to reschedule the appointment in three months, earlier if you require.  Then all you need to do is give me a call okay.  

PATIENT F233
So give me the card.

DOCTOR F233
Yeah exactly and then at that time I can actually get some idea that how many times you needed it okay and how many times it actually benefited you.

PATIENT F233
Sure.

DOCTOR F233
Okay, um this will give me some idea that which kind of test @@@ I need to put in and what type of @@@ test I need to verify.

PATIENT F233
Yeah.

DOCTOR F233
This gives me an idea of what.

PATIENT F233
Yeah.

DOCTOR F233
If I did one now, I'm sure it would come normal.

PATIENT F233
Okay.  No that's good yeah.

DOCTOR F233
@@@.  I'm going to discuss this with DOCTOR okay and then I'll be back in a few minutes and then we'll talk more about it.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

DOCTOR F233
Sounds good to you?

PATIENT F233
Yeah, yeah.

(DOCTOR OUT:  88:38)

SECOND DOCTOR F233
I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT F233
How ya doing sir?

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Great and yourself?

PATIENT F233
Not bad.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
My name is DOCTOR I work with DOCTOR here.  Uh we were just kind of talking a little bit about what's going on.  @@@ I'll have you sit there for a minute, @@@ formal about it.  Now um, are you a smoker?

PATIENT F233
No.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Have you ever smoked?

PATIENT F233
Never.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Never.  Not even pot?

PATIENT F233
No.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Okay alright um, it's just kind of weird to have asthma pop up later in life.

PATIENT F233
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
So um, DOCTOR we were talking quite a bit about what to do about this and we got a plan for it but I think ultimately you wanted to try and redo that test that sounds like they couldn't do last time.

PATIENT F233
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Did they use, was it one where they asked you to breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe?

PATIENT F233
Exactly.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Yeah.

PATIENT F233
I blanked out on that exam.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Okay alright.

PATIENT F233
It happened at St um, St. Alexis.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Okay.  Would you mind trying it again?

PATIENT F233
No I don't mind.  I want to find out what's going.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT F233
I really do.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Cause you know there's other things that kind of creep into the picture you know with your obstructive sleep apnea.

PATIENT F233
Sure.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
That could be affecting things.  You know, so you look like you sometimes have @@@.

PATIENT F233
Yeah around my chest.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Okay, what do you, what kind of stuff.

PATIENT F233
Uh I go to school right now, to auto mechanic school.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Okay do you notice that your shortness of breath is problematic at work?

PATIENT F233
No it's only when I do any kind activity.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
@@@.

PATIENT F233
Exactly.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Okay, alright.  So I think starting from scratch is reasonable.  We may not find the answer with just one test but at least we can call the decision if it's not asthma.

PATIENT F233
Sure.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
It's a pretty good test.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
If we can get you through it.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Um and then in the meantime we're gonna have you stop that albuterol.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
You don't need to take it twice a day.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Um you can take it if you feel like you need it.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
If you feel like this is associated with exertion as well um you can take it um basically like half an hour to an hour before.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
You start exerting yourself so in some ways it's like pulmonary Viagra.

PATIENT F233
Yeah, okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
To dilate.  I think this happens a lot when you're with your wife.

PATIENT F233
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Okay so, if you think you're gonna put the moves on her you know.

PATIENT F233
Oh.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
You know it's gonna be a night where the kids are sleeping.

PATIENT F233
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
@@@.  Well not.

PATIENT F233
Yeah, a combination.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Well go ahead, exactly, exactly.  So and that might work and that's something that we can, if something definitely happens with people that you know go outside in the cold.

PATIENT F233
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
But don't be, @@@ asthma at all.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
So we got to take it one step at a time.

PATIENT F233
Okay that's fine.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
I'm gonna take a listen to you now.

PATIENT F233
Sure.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Um, the main thing is DOCTOR was telling me a little bit about your survey.

PATIENT F233
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F233
Seems that they do, it's verbal.  Looks like you're gonna see Mental Health.

PATIENT F233
No I was seeing DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR F233

FIRST DOCTOR F233
You're gonna stop the albuterol.

PATIENT F233

FIRST DOCTOR F233

PATIENT F233
Sure.

FIRST DOCTOR F233
Before exercise.

PATIENT F233
Before activity.

FIRST DOCTOR F233
Exactly.  And I'm gonna put this pulmonary function test @@@ study if needed.

Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR F233

PATIENT F233

FIRST DOCTOR F233
Uh apart from that, I donâ€™tâ€™ have anything for you.

PATIENT F233

FIRST DOCTOR F233

PATIENT F233
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR F233
Let me put in the order, now.

PATIENT F233
Okay.  Doctor, uh I ran out of my Levitra.  Is there any way um the doctor could recommend my Levitra back?

FIRST DOCTOR F233
Do you take the Levitra on a regular basis?

PATIENT F233
Only when Iâ€™m going to do someting I don't have it every day.

FIRST DOCTOR F233

PATIENT F233

FIRST DOCTOR F233
Okay.

PATIENT F233
Uh with doctor, I think @@@ gave me.

FIRST DOCTOR F233

PATIENT F233
