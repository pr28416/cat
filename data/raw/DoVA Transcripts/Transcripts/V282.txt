Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V282
Do want any nicotine gum or any patches?  Sit up here.

PATIENT V282
I'd try some gum.

DOCTOR V282
You want to try some gum okay.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V282
Nice deep breaths, again.  How much, um how many cigarettes do you smoke a day?

PATIENT V282
About half a pack.

DOCTOR V282
Half a pack.  And how long have you been smoking for?

PATIENT V282
38 years.

DOCTOR V282
38 years okay.  Okay so the thing about the gum is that um you can't chew it and smoke at the same time.  So if you're gonna smoke, then you spit it out.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V282
What you do is you take the gum; you chew it a little bit when you get the urge and then you park it in the back of the mouth.  You don't keep chewing it cause this is going to keep releasing nicotine.  Once that urge goes away then you park it and then you chew it again if you have another urge.  If you have to have a smoke then spit it out.  Be careful @@@ okay.

PATIENT V282
Okay.

DOCTOR V282
Let me order that for a pick-up.  Do you want to pick that up today?

PATIENT V282
Yes.

DOCTOR V282
Or do you want to pick, okay sure.

PATIENT V282

DOCTOR V282
All at once?  You want me to just order all your medications for pick-up today?

PATIENT V282
Yes.

DOCTOR V282
Okay.

PATIENT V282
So you said I got 30 days to get it right?

DOCTOR V282
Uh-huh.  Do you know how much hydrochlorothiazide you're on?  Is it 12.5 or 25 mg?

PATIENT V282
I don't know.

DOCTOR V282
You don't know um hmm.  How do I order this then for you?  Do you want to call back or how do you want this done because I don't know what dose you're on.

PATIENT V282
The lowest dosage.

DOCTOR V282
It's the lowest dosage?

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V282
Okay.  Do you take half a pill or a whole pill?

PATIENT V282
Whole pill.

DOCTOR V282
You take a whole one then I think its 25 mg then okay.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.  Sound about right, 25 mg that sound about right.

DOCTOR V282
Yeah cause half a pill would be 12.5.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V282
I'm gonna have these all available for pick-up okay.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V282
Whenever you want to come get them.

PATIENT V282

DOCTOR V282
Yeah, any time between today and 30 days.

PATIENT V282

Uh-huh on the 7th.  Okay.  Okay I will be right back okay.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

(DOCTOR OUT:  18:53  DOCTOR IN:  21:45)

DOCTOR V282
Have you had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT V282
No.

DOCTOR V282
Are you interested in having one?

PATIENT V282
I don't know, it depends on how long will it take?

DOCTOR V282
Um you've got to prep so you have diarrhea for about a day and then the procedure so when you go in it's uh kind of wait a little bit, they prep you and then they go in.  Actually it's a 30-40 minute procedure but there are, there's a time period where you do have to wait while you're there.  Um mainly because they give you stuff to sedate you and then you need someone to drive you home.

PATIENT V282
Well maybe next year.

DOCTOR V282
Maybe next year okay.  Did you get your flu shot this year?

PATIENT V282
Around January.  @@@ yes, yes.

DOCTOR V282
You did get your flu shot okay great.

PATIENT V282
As a matter of fact your nurses gave them to me.

DOCTOR V282
Oh yeah you said that.

PATIENT V282
About that colonoscopy, what are you guys looking for?

DOCTOR V282
We're looking for cancer.

PATIENT V282
Colon cancer?

DOCTOR V282
Uh-huh.  So the reason why we um screen for colon cancer early, starting at the age of 50 is because uh colon cancer is asymptomatic so a lot of times when you have it you don't even know you have it.  If we catch it early while it's still in the asymptomatic stage.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V282
Then it's easier to treat than if we catch later and it spreads everywhere.

PATIENT V282
If I had colon cancer what would some of the symptoms be?

DOCTOR V282
Um you might have some bleeding from below, you might have some weight loss but sometimes you can be completely asymptomatic so you don't know.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.  If you schedule it it's got to be for January.

DOCTOR V282
Yeah I mean, so I mean do you want me to set you up for it or not right now?

PATIENT V282
Not right now.

DOCTOR V282
Not right now okay.

PATIENT V282
Why did you guys stop sending me my ED pills?

DOCTOR V282
You're what?

PATIENT V282
Erection dysfunctional pills?

DOCTOR V282
Hold on let me see.  I don't know.

PATIENT V282
Could you have them send them back to me?

DOCTOR V282
Sure I can ask, that's a question for DOCTOR, you can ask her when she comes in here okay.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V282
Were they working for you?

PATIENT V282
Yes they were.  I miss them too.

DOCTOR V282
So these actually have to be mailed to you.

PATIENT V282
And I want to know why they stopped, what happened, how come they stopped mailing them to me.

DOCTOR V282
I'm not sure why they stopped.  I'm going to give you some more of those though.

PATIENT V282
So @@@ 

DOCTOR V282
No thoughts of um hurting yourself, hurting others?

PATIENT V282
No, no, no, no.

DOCTOR V282
Great.  Alright, I don't know what's taking so long for this.  

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Did you page me?

FIRST DOCTOR V282
Oh yeah sorry, can you take your shoe off again so she can look at your toe?

SECOND DOCTOR V282
How long has it been bothering you? 

PATIENT V282
It's not bothering me, its ugly looking.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Oh okay.  So how long has it been going on?
 
PATIENT V282
About ten years.  Every time I cut it off it grows back the same way.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Looks like an ingrown toenail.  And it doesn't hurt at the base of your toe at all?

PATIENT V282
No.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Oh uh-huh.  Lay back for me sir.  Never hurts you at all?

PATIENT V282
Uh uh.

(Doctors discuss between themselves)

PATIENT V282
Should it be hurting?

SECOND DOCTOR V282
No it's good that it's not hurting.  I'm just surprised that it's not hurting at all @@@.  Um there's no liver disease or anything?

PATIENT V282
No liver disease.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Do you drink sir?

PATIENT V282
I was @@@, I been clean 20 months.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Good.  You're not drinking at all?

PATIENT V282
No.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Excellent.

(Doctors talk among themselves)

SECOND DOCTOR V282
So uh you definitely have a fungal infection in your toenail.  Um I want you to see the foot doctors and we'll see what they think would be like an option for you but cutting it, with just starting you on a fungal medication and taking it for a while, seeing what happens to your toe and if it gets better then I think in the end you're still going to need to get part of the toenail cut off and hopefully it'll re-grow normally.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
But I think they're probably going to say you need to take a fungal medication for quite some time, months in fact, before they'll cut it okay.  Cause this will probably control this infection.  Uh when you have a fungal infection in your toenails it doesn't cause a blood infection.  It's not going to go into a bloodstream and cause you know sickness.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Uh it is cosmetic, actually this is quite severe uh.  In order for a fungal medication to work you have to take it the entire time your toenail is growing.  So you can imagine how slow your toenail grows, you have to take this medicine for 2-3 months sometimes while the toenail is growing so all the new growth does not have fungus in it. Fungal medications can cause, you can sit up, can cause liver problems and that's why we were asking you about hepatitis prevention and stuff.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
So you have to come in every one month to two months to get uh blood tests to make sure your liver is okay.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

(Doctors talk among themselves)

SECOND DOCTOR V282
So uh it is an option.  I want you to talk to the foot doctors first and then we'll go from there.

PATIENT V282
Gotcha.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Okay.  So you can make an appointment up front with the foot doctors um.  I do want you to know because this is not painful, it is in some ways cosmetic, so if you decide you don't want to do any of these things because you're worried about hurting your liver or whatever, then that's an option too because this is not going to cause a blood borne infection.

PATIENT V282
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
And this is @@@ so you have to decide if you're willing to take that risk.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
I can't decide that for you.

PATIENT V282
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Okay, questions?

PATIENT V282
Uh uh.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Okay.  So why don't you put your shoes and socks back on.  I'll put in the Podiatry consult and you can make an appointment up front okay.

PATIENT V282
I have to make the appointment for the foot doctor?

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Yeah they'll make it right up front.

PATIENT V282
They can do that?

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Yeah.

PATIENT V282
Can you do it in the computer?

FIRST DOCTOR V282
No I don't do that; they can do it up front though.

SECOND DOCTOR V282
Of course they can.  Okay but we'll put the order in the computer for you today.

FIRST DOCTOR V282
Alright for this is for you, take it out to the front desk and I'm gonna you to go to the Lab to check your liver profile, to get the liver labs.  You haven't had one in over a year okay.  So @@@ medicines @@@ hurt your liver.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR V282
It's something that you could consider, @@@ talk to the podiatrist okay.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR V282
They can see if they can possibly treat it, um after they cut it out and stuff and that is also an option but we're not the foot specialist and I'm not really sure what I can offer you.
 
PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR V282
Other than the medicine okay.  Go ahead and put your shoe on.

PATIENT V282
Do you know what's @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR V282
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V282
You can tell me, I was @@@ 80%, 60%, 30% of health care here?

FIRST DOCTOR V282
I’m not sure how much you are covered if you like.  It should say on this piece of paper.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR V282
I do believe but it doesn't.  You can ask them up front how much, what percent you are but it doesn't say right here and I'm not really sure where I would find it @@@.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR V282
Oh you're free to go.  All you have to do is go up to the front and schedule your foot doctor appointment, tell them as soon as possible but they schedule it cause it's written on that piece of paper, then go to the Lab and get your labs done and @@@ back here.  Feel free to pick up your medicines whenever @@@.

PATIENT V282
Uh-huh.
