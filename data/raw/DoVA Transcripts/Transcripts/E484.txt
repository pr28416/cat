You don't think so?

PATIENT E484
No yeah @@@ to it.  Uh uh, it's supposed to make you dizzy?

DOCTOR E484
Is it supposed to?  No.  I'm just worried, I'm just wondering if it ever drops your blood pressure too low.

PATIENT E484
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

DOCTOR E484
And it might not.  This might be a perfect regimen for you to be on these three pills.  Cause it looks like your blood pressure is a lot better.

PATIENT E484
Yeah but sometimes I'd have to say no.  I've been @@@ for the last, every @@@ exercise more @@@.  I haven't been stressed out.

DOCTOR E484
Good.

PATIENT E484
I just try to take one of those.

DOCTOR E484
You can take it, so that medicine hydralazine only lasts for a few hours.

PATIENT E484
Oh.

DOCTOR E484
To lower your blood pressure.  It's one of those that if you're not controlled on these two medicines then sometimes we add, we just take twice a day each pill like I'd say lasts for about 6-7 hours okay.

PATIENT E484
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E484
But if you take one in the morning you know and you take one in the afternoon.  Do you ever check your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT E484
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR E484
And what does it usually run?

PATIENT E484
Uh 140 over sometimes 79, 82.

DOCTOR E484
Like 140?

PATIENT E484
Yeah.

DOCTOR E484
Okay so you can take this probably in the afternoon okay.

PATIENT E484
Okay.

DOCTOR E484
So take it twice a day so once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  You probably have a lot of it, the hydralazine.

PATIENT E484
Okay what was the date 1/15?

DOCTOR E484
Yeah.  That's if you took this in the morning probably.

PATIENT E484
Yeah cause I had.

DOCTOR E484
So it lasts for about 6-7 hours.

PATIENT E484
I see, but yeah that's as long as I get no pain.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah that's good.

PATIENT E484
Yeah.

DOCTOR E484
Because this is blood pressure.

PATIENT E484
Yeah I just get, if I lose some weight I don't need all those pills.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah.

PATIENT E484
I need some uh.

DOCTOR E484
So if you lose a lot of weight then maybe we can get rid of the hydralazine okay.

PATIENT E484
Yeah I need acetaminophen.

DOCTOR E484
Acetaminophen?  Let's see you've got three refills on that so we'll just refill it today.

PATIENT E484
Okay that's good.

DOCTOR E484

PATIENT E484
Okay that's good.

DOCTOR E484
Um and then we'll check these other blood tests because we want to make sure you don't have another reason to have high blood pressure and it was normal too.

PATIENT E484

DOCTOR E484

PATIENT E484
@@@.  I don't even know.

DOCTOR E484
Okay so a number of years ago.

PATIENT E484
Yeah it's been a couple of years ago.  That's a blood thinner right?

DOCTOR E484
No metoprolol is actually a medicine, when did you have your heart attack?  In 2000?  Around there?

PATIENT E484
Yeah something like that yeah that's it.  And I think I was on, they put me on metoprolol then I think.  What's the blood thinner they had me on?

DOCTOR E484
You might have been, were you on Warfarin or anything like that?  Heparin?

PATIENT E484
Uh uh, I was on metoprolol.

DOCTOR E484
I'm looking back so let's see you were on metoprolol in July of 2000.  So we'll see what was going on then.  Okay.  Okay so you were also on Plavix.

PATIENT E484
Yeah that's what I was trying to think of, Plavix.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah.  How long, you were probably on Plavix for a year or so.

PATIENT E484
Yeah that one, I think I was on metoprolol at the same time.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah you were on them together, so let's see when they took you off.  It looks like you're still on metoprolol in 2001, in 2002; you were still on metoprolol in 2003 so.  

PATIENT E484
And I @@@.

DOCTOR E484
Let's see in 2004 you were still on it and let's see 2005 you were still on it.  You were on it for a long time.

PATIENT E484
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E484
Looks like so the Plavix you were still on in 2005 too.  Even in 2008 you were on the metoprolol but you weren't on the Plavix then.  Let's see what it says.

PATIENT E484
Now why did they take me off the metoprolol?  Seems like the metoprolol gave me @@@.

DOCTOR E484
So you were on the metoprolol for a long time.

PATIENT E484
About 8 years?

DOCTOR E484
At least so up to 2009 I think you were still on it.

PATIENT E484
Well @@@.

DOCTOR E484
In 2011 you were still on it.  So why did this get discontinued in 2011?  January @@@.

PATIENT E484

DOCTOR E484
Yeah DOCTOR.

PATIENT E484

DOCTOR E484
So it looks like you got a stress test done, 2011, do you remember that?

PATIENT E484
Uh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR E484
We're cracking open the vault here.  Uh let's see.  I think DOCTOR took you off of it.  Do remember him?

PATIENT E484
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR E484
Skinny guy.  Yeah.

PATIENT E484

DOCTOR E484
I took his place.

PATIENT E484
Oh yeah I think, well it seemed like I was getting a doctor every six months.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah we switched, me and DOCTOR.  He went to Houston.

PATIENT E484
Oh okay.

DOCTOR E484
That's where I'm from.

PATIENT E484
Oh.  I don't know if he's been @@@.

DOCTOR E484
What were doing @@@?

PATIENT E484
Uh I seemed to have a family reunion down there.  I was in Houston in a place called Sugarland. 

DOCTOR E484
Oh that's where my family lives.

PATIENT E484
Oh they do?

DOCTOR E484
Yeah.

PATIENT E484
I was just.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah that's where @@@.

PATIENT E484
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR E484
On the bay.

PATIENT E484
The @@@.  It's hot down there, pretty hot.

DOCTOR E484
Oh was it really hot?

PATIENT E484
Hot, hot, hot.  It was so hot I was in the hotel and when I go outside my glasses would get fogged up boom.  Just like @@@.

DOCTOR E484
You were glad to come back to Chicago?

PATIENT E484
It was hot here too though.  Yeah it was still @@@, Sugarland, Texas, thatâ€™s the first time I heard of Sugarland.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah people think I'm making it up when I say I'm from Sugarland.

PATIENT E484
No it's a real city, it's real.

DOCTOR E484
It's a real city.

PATIENT E484
It's real.  There was a nice little place, @@@ little stores and malls.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah.

PATIENT E484
Little slot machines, within walking distance of everything.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah it's a nice little suburb.

PATIENT E484
Yeah sort of @@@ with Houston.

DOCTOR E484
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E484
They had good food.

DOCTOR E484
Okay so I think I cracked the mystery.

PATIENT E484
Alright.

DOCTOR E484
So do you think around the time that you had your heart attack did you use any kind of drug whatsoever back then?  It was a long time ago so you may not remember.

PATIENT E484
Uh 2011.

DOCTOR E484
It was 2000.

PATIENT E484
2000 oh yes I was kind of back on drugs then.

DOCTOR E484
@@@ cocaine?

PATIENT E484
2011 you say?

DOCTOR E484
In 2000.

PATIENT E484
Oh 2000.

DOCTOR E484
A long time ago.

PATIENT E484
Yeah.

DOCTOR E484
You might have been using cocaine or something like that?

PATIENT E484
I could've yeah.

DOCTOR E484
Could be right so I think why they took you off of that is because I think when they did your stress test.

PATIENT E484
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E484
They didn't see anything with your heart that would predispose you like this just showed that you had a heart attack that caused a lot of damage.

PATIENT E484
Alright cause I stopped doing some of the things I was doing.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah so it got better though.

PATIENT E484
Yeah it did.

DOCTOR E484
So.

PATIENT E484
I stopped a whole lot of things.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah so I think that maybe what could've caused is maybe some cocaine.  Sometimes this causes what they call a spasm in the heart.

PATIENT E484
Right.

DOCTOR E484
It's called a spasm and it looks exactly like a heart attack and it feels exactly like a heart attack and it is.

PATIENT E484
Yes.

DOCTOR E484
So people get a lot of recovery time.

PATIENT E484
Yeah but what's, I've been, okay I been still having an @@@.

DOCTOR E484
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E484
And I was in the hospital and uh they said I had a heart attack, I had a walking heart attack and wondered if I'd used cocaine but I couldn't use no cocaine cause I was in the hospital.  I had been in the hospital about 2-3 weeks.

DOCTOR E484
Oh @@@ time.

PATIENT E484
Yeah.  Oh come on get in the wheelchair. Wheelchair for what? @@@ heart attack.  @@@ that's what I'm saying.  So @@@.  I had to stay in Intensive Care for a long week.  I think my high blood pressure had a lot to do with @@@.

DOCTOR E484
Okay good.  

PATIENT E484
I think the high blood pressure got something to do with @@@.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah.  What @@@ Viet Nam?

PATIENT E484
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah.  Oh you were right.

PATIENT E484

DOCTOR E484
Let's look at those.

PATIENT E484
I mean do I have to do a whole new CPAP right?

DOCTOR E484
Oh you would?

PATIENT E484
Yeah cause I have the dinosaur CPAP.  I got it in the 90s when I first got that CPAP.  I said I'd use it @@@.  And it's old really.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah.  Cardiovascular @@@.

PATIENT E484
Uh what?

DOCTOR E484
Those are the @@@ the sleep apnea does.  I'll go over with you.

PATIENT E484

Uh-huh.  You stop breathing sometimes.  It can increase your blood pressure but you're already on medicine.

PATIENT E484
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E484

@@@.  Yeah.  @@@.  You have to sleep with it over your head all strapped and that's not comfortable.

DOCTOR E484

So anytime you feel like maybe you want to exchange your dinosaur CPAP machine and try a new one and see if maybe the new ones like, I don't know I've never used a CPAP but I imagine it's really uncomfortable.  Maybe the new ones are a little bit better I don't know.

DOCTOR E484
Yeah so, the good thing is to lose the weight.
