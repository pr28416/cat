PATIENT U531
And I had some of them and some of them counts as some of them still and my machine ain't no young machine, it's a old one.

DOCTOR U531
You need to bring it in so we can make sure that it's actually working right.  Um your diabetes is definitely not well controlled.

PATIENT U531
I can see that.

DOCTOR U531
Okay and it needs to be controlled a lot better.

PATIENT U531
And I can check it three times enough, that ain't no problem.

DOCTOR U531
It's not a matter of checking it three times, it's a matter of making sure your monitor is working right and then it's a matter of uh you know maybe adjusting your medication or increase it.

PATIENT U531
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR U531
And I think we probably do at this point.

PATIENT U531
I was on 20 units and ‘020 they raised it to 22.

DOCTOR U531
You're on 22 right?

PATIENT U531
Yes ma'am I am.

DOCTOR U531
Okay.  Are you taking, but you're not taking anything else for diabetes right?

PATIENT U531
All I'm taking is what you gave me.

DOCTOR U531
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U531
I was on two but I got scheduled at @@@ and he took me off of it.  I had went into a semi-coma cause of that, it was too low.

DOCTOR U531
And when was that?

PATIENT U531
Oh back in the summer.  It happened to me like three times.  @@@ I call it.

DOCTOR U531
What?

PATIENT U531
@@@.  You get it down real fast when it’s high.

DOCTOR U531
And what did you take?

PATIENT U531
Oh I don't take it now, DOCTOR took me off it.

DOCTOR U531
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U531
I was scared of it.  It was dangerous.  Like you know make my sugars drop too low.

DOCTOR U531
Yeah.

PATIENT U531
And now I'm @@@?

DOCTOR U531
Hmm.  So it looks like in January they had increased to 26 units.

PATIENT U531
Well I ain't, I ain’t gonna be lyin’, I ain't never took no 26.

DOCTOR U531
@@@?

PATIENT U531
On my vial I only take the 22.

DOCTOR U531
Okay.

PATIENT U531
Maybe that's the problem.

DOCTOR U531
And you finished five days of steroids right, for your knee?

PATIENT U531
Is it what I was taking for the gout?

DOCTOR U531
Yes.  It was, you were taking it at the beginning of January.

PATIENT U531
Uh they send me a.

DOCTOR U531
And they gave you five days of steroids.

PATIENT U531
Yeah, yes ma'am I guess that was the name of it.  I took it like they told me and it helped that.

DOCTOR U531
And it helped with the pain, okay.

PATIENT U531
But they know they can say they won't give it to no diabetic, that's what they said but I then @@@ go with the instruction only.

DOCTOR U531
Okay.  Ho’s your eating going?

PATIENT U531
I got a pretty good appetite sometimes.

DOCTOR U531
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U531
And like, well my nurse you know, that's the home nurse from the doctor in the Mobile Unit and I wouldn't, wasn't really giving me a good appetite, I didn't want no more of that Ensure milk.  They got a milk pill for me for a diabetic.

DOCTOR U531
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U531
And they claim they don't have it but they do have it and I knows that.

DOCTOR U531
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U531
And I want to know why I can't have it.  

DOCTOR U531

PATIENT U531
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR U531
Okay.

PATIENT U531
And my nurse had gave me.

DOCTOR U531
Oh you're wondering why they can't prescribe it to you.

PATIENT U531
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR U531
Oh, I don't actually normally prescribe that's something, because that's something you can buy over-the-counter.  I can ask DOCTOR.

PATIENT U531
I can't afford that kind of milk over-the-counter.

DOCTOR U531
Yeah I mean.

PATIENT U531
I’m telling you they gave me.

DOCTOR U531
Wait, it's not a medication.  It's just a supplement.

PATIENT U531
It's a medication for me.

DOCTOR U531
Unfortunately it's not a medication for everybody, so it's not something that we can prescribe.

PATIENT U531
They said @@@ I had @@@.

DOCTOR U531
I can talk with DOCTOR and ask her, you know how they do it.

PATIENT U531
But, what they saying they didn't have it.  She gave me uh, she wrote it down for me.

PATIENT U531
But that @@@ makes you go, whoo.

DOCTOR U531
Yeah, you want to make sure.

PATIENT U531

DOCTOR U531
Yeah I don't think I've ever actually written a prescription for that but we can ask DOCTOR and see.

PATIENT U531
