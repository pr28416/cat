PATIENT S782
Even in the house.

DOCTOR S782
Do you get short of breath if you don't or?

PATIENT S782
You know sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.  When you usually go through a flight of stairs or just when?

PATIENT S782
Oh stairs, the stairs kill me.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
But I'm getting ready to move somewhere there ain't no stairs, the stairs are killing me.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.

DOCTOR S782

DOCTOR S782
Still a little short of breath when you move.

PATIENT S782
Still, it ain't no difference you know.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT S782
It still hurts right up in here.  The pain, it hurts right up in here.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
You know something, dropping it's something a little bit more.  This is mild pain.  There's some a little bit more complicated than what uh what the doctors think it is cause it's been there five years.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.

PATIENT S782
And it's been the same thing.  It's the same thing.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
It ain't getting no worse but it ain't getting no better.

DOCTOR S782
Okay, okay.

PATIENT S782
You know I can't walk upstairs.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.

PATIENT S782
Can't walk a long distance.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
And it's steady and it's constant.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.

PATIENT S782
If I was 25 or 30 years younger I'd ask to do exploratory surgery cause.

DOCTOR S782
You don't want that, trust me, you don't want that.

PATIENT S782
No, I don't want that.

DOCTOR S782
You've had, I mean you've had like heart work up before because besides your lungs, your heart sits right there, if I remember correctly looked fine right?

PATIENT S782
Yeah.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.  So that's good in that respect um.  It's a combination of things.  It's your lung disease, the COPD um combined with the obstructive sleep apnea you have.  Are you using the CPAP still at night?  Do you use it every night or half a night?

PATIENT S782
Every night.  When I'm sleeping but when I sleeping light.  I'll go to sleep at 9 or 10 o'clock and I'll wake up at 2 in the morning.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
And then I'm up until 8, 9 or 10 o'clock the next night.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.

PATIENT S782
You know sometimes I take a nap, sometimes I don't.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.  Is it the breathing that keeps you from sleeping well or what is it or you just never have been a good sleeper, or what?

PATIENT S782
Uh you know it's hard to you know, it's hard to say.  It is hard to pinpoint because.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
I been like that ever since I uh came from Vietnam.  You know I couldn't get a good night's sleep and this carried on over the last four years because for that one year I was over there.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
I was up at all different times of the night.  You know I never got no more than three, four hours sleep.  Maybe five some nights if it was that much and it just carried over, over the years.

DOCTOR S782
Do you find yourself dozing off during the day sometimes?

PATIENT S782
No.

DOCTOR S782
You don't doze off?

PATIENT S782
No, you know that lady, that doctor up in the hospital had me, made me admit to that but you know what I don't doze off during the day.

DOCTOR S782
You don't.

PATIENT S782
No.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.

PATIENT S782
But see I was up there, I was up there and they had me on so many different type of drugs, I don't know what I was doing up there or what I was saying.

DOCTOR S782
What do you do for your blood pressure right now?

PATIENT S782
Um carvedilol.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
Losarin.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
And it start with a d, what is that?

DOCTOR S782
Diltiazem?

PATIENT S782
@@@ that.

DOCTOR S782
They had increased some of your stuff.  Have you taken the higher doses?

PATIENT S782
Right.

DOCTOR S782
You have been?  Cause your blood pressures are a little bit high so do you?

PATIENT S782
This morning.

DOCTOR S782
Did you take it this morning?

PATIENT S782
This morning I forgot to take my carvedilol.

DOCTOR S782
Okay, okay, sure.

PATIENT S782
I forgot to take it.

DOCTOR S782
Sure, yeah uh that happens a lot um.

PATIENT S782
And because you know I take it, I took it last night at 10 o'clock.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
So at 5 o'clock that was too early.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
To take it again.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
But see I'm up every night at 5 in the morning.

DOCTOR S782
Right.

PATIENT S782
I want to take all my medication at 5 in the morning but if I take it at 7 or 8 at night you know that ain't 12 hours.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah and I mean it doesn't have to be 12 hours on the dot.  If it's between not taking it at 12 hours on the dot or.

PATIENT S782
Taking it.

DOCTOR S782
Taking it then we'd rather you just take it at like eight hours than not taking it at all so.

PATIENT S782
And uh since they increased that carvedilol I got, like water or something is in my ear you know.

DOCTOR S782
Oh.

PATIENT S782
Yeah you know, it does it just like a 300 gram of aspirin do me.  I can't take a high volume aspirin.

DOCTOR S782
Oh.

PATIENT S782
Cause I do this, you know I feel something like a echo.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.  Does it affect your hearing?

PATIENT S782
No.

DOCTOR S782
It doesn't affect your hearing okay.

PATIENT S782
Just uncomfortable.

DOCTOR S782
Okay, alright.  Do you check your blood pressure at home by any chance?

PATIENT S782
Uh I don't have a machine.

DOCTOR S782
You don't, oh we can get you one.

PATIENT S782
And they uh, they wanted me to get one of those oxygen monitors.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah that actually wouldn't be a bad idea either.

PATIENT S782
But uh.

DOCTOR S782
@@@.

PATIENT S782
But I don't uh, at home, like here, I feel pretty good but see at home I got some carpet on the floor.  I think I'm allergic to that carpet where I stay at.

DOCTOR S782
Why do you say that, what is it?

PATIENT S782
You see I can't breathe sometimes.  But when I leave it, when I leave it.

DOCTOR S782
Does it stop when you're gone?

PATIENT S782
Sometimes.  When I leave the house I'm good.

DOCTOR S782
Okay um.  How old is this where you're staying?

PATIENT S782
Oh it's a new place.  Could be how cheap is the carpet right.

DOCTOR S782
It's new?  Yeah or if it's had mold on your carpet but it's brand new.

PATIENT S782
I have no, the carpet ain't brand new.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.

PATIENT S782
And you know what, you're probably right because when my son moved in to the apartment, see I stay with my son now.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
The apartment, the carpets looked like it was dirty but they say they had cleaned it so it was probably what you said mold on those carpets.

DOCTOR S782
It's possible and that can really aggravate your lung disease.

PATIENT S782
Yeah.  My son will be walking around sniffling.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.

PATIENT S782
He don't know, he don't know nothing about it now.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.

PATIENT S782
He ain't figured it out yet.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.

PATIENT S782
But I done figured out about that carpet.  He better off not having it.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah that's true actually.  Would you rather pick it up or would you rather it sent to your house?

PATIENT S782
What's that?

DOCTOR S782
The blood pressure cuff and the O2 machine?

PATIENT S782
Well I'll be back down this Thursday the 10th.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.

PATIENT S782
I could pick it up.

DOCTOR S782
Do you know where to pick it up?

PATIENT S782
Yeah.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.  I'll have it ready for you so it's there um.

PATIENT S782
And uh other than that you know I don't know why you increased that carvedilol on me uh.

DOCTOR S782
What was the reason?  It looks like your blood pressure was pretty high while you were in the hospital.

PATIENT S782
They made it that high.

DOCTOR S782
Because they aggravated you?

PATIENT S782
I ain't gonna say that, I ain't gonna say a word.

DOCTOR S782
Well you know it's, I mean.  Stick with the increased dose.

PATIENT S782
Yeah.

DOCTOR S782
You keep checking your blood pressure at home, if they're low or if you're getting nauseated or dizzy, then certainly we should back off a little bit okay.

PATIENT S782
I don't get nauseated.  I don't get dizzy.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah, yeah.  Those are usually the side effects that we see with if the carvedilol dose is too high.

PATIENT S782
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S782
I mean if you get those and your blood pressures are low, lower than normal, um cause your blood pressure usually runs high so if you start getting blood pressures like 100, 110, then maybe that's a little bit too aggressive and we can back off a little.

PATIENT S782
That's what I was getting.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.

PATIENT S782
I missed the two tablets this morning.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
And it's at 147.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.  Well what 147 is still considered high.

PATIENT S782
But see some doctors say they like to see my blood pressure at 130.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah less than 130.

PATIENT S782
Yeah less than 130.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah it's higher than 130.

PATIENT S782
Right but.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
That worries me but anybody say well 147's alright for you.  You know I say what you know what can I say?

DOCTOR S782
The goal is less than 130.  If it's running in the 140s then we can be okay with it but we would prefer not cause you're 62, you're still young.

PATIENT S782
(Laughter)

DOCTOR S782
Relatively.  With all the Veterans that we see.

PATIENT S782
Oh yeah I know.

DOCTOR S782
So.

PATIENT S782
Yeah.

DOCTOR S782
So you still have a lot of years left.

PATIENT S782
Yeah.

DOCTOR S782
So you have your blood pressures all crazy now, that's gonna cut years off of your life.

PATIENT S782
Right, right.

DOCTOR S782
So we might as well be a little more aggressive if we can.

PATIENT S782
And there's something else I be wondering too.  They gave me these two things up there, where you know you inhale them.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT S782
One got a capsule.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
And the other one got a counter.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
What is that with the one with the counter?  I don't see nothing in there.

DOCTOR S782
Is it?

PATIENT S782
Is it liquid or what?

DOCTOR S782
The, do you put anything in it?

PATIENT S782
One of them you don't put nothing in it you just take the cap off.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
And the counter goes, you know there's a counter on it, it's 60 doses.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
And the counter goes there and you inhale it.

DOCTOR S782
And you like push the lever or whatever and you inhale it real quick?  Is there a lever or anything that you push?

PATIENT S782
You talking about the one with the capsule.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah let me see which ones you're on.

PATIENT S782
You talking about the one with the capsule.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.

PATIENT S782
Now that's the only one that I can feel when I can inhale it.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
But uh that other one.

DOCTOR S782
You don't feel like there's anything in it?

PATIENT S782
I don't feel like nothing's coming out, that's what I say uh.

DOCTOR S782
Oh.

PATIENT S782
I even took it one time and turned it over upside down.  I didn't see nothing come out.

DOCTOR S782
You know the best thing to do in that instance is probably to bring it to the Pharmacy next time you're here and ask them about it and say hey look at this is it really working.

PATIENT S782
Yeah.

DOCTOR S782
So yeah, bring it in.

PATIENT S782
But I'm trying to say do I really need it?

DOCTOR S782
You do for your lung disease.  One's called mometasone.

PATIENT S782
Right.

DOCTOR S782
And that is supposed to be twice a day.

PATIENT S782
Right.

DOCTOR S782
And what's the other one they have you on, let's see.  Do you take albuterol, does that sound familiar?

PATIENT S782
I got some albuterol.  I got that which is use as needed.

DOCTOR S782
How often are you using that?

PATIENT S782
Well I used it last night.  It seemed to work.

DOCTOR S782
It does?

PATIENT S782
I feel like, you know after I used the two powders.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
Uh I be stopped up.  Something's happening down there with them two powders and uh you know I can't breathe after using those two powders.  I believe that's what it is.  See I mean, I know you doctors like to order medication but.

DOCTOR S782
Formoterol, that's what it is.

PATIENT S782
That's what I got?

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
But that's the powder.

DOCTOR S782
You're on formoterol.

PATIENT S782
What about the other powder though?

DOCTOR S782
You only have two medicines for your lungs disease right, besides the albuterol.  Albuterol is the one you use.

PATIENT S782
Correct.

DOCTOR S782
The formoterol and mometasone are the two that you have.

PATIENT S782
Okay.  One of them is a little capsule.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.

PATIENT S782
That's the one you drop in the little machine.

DOCTOR S782
And then you inhale it.

PATIENT S782
Squeeze it.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
And inhale it.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
Now I feel that.

DOCTOR S782
Yes.

PATIENT S782
That other one, you just screw the cap off and a counter, I don't feel nothing coming out of that.

DOCTOR S782
The best thing to do is just bring it into the Pharmacy and let them look at it.

PATIENT S782
What does that do though?  Do I need them both?

DOCTOR S782
You do need them both cause they do different things.  One is, one is to make your airways bigger.

PATIENT S782
Right.

DOCTOR S782
So more air can come in and one is to decrease the inflammation that you have going in there.  So they work differently.

PATIENT S782
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah cause we can make your airways bigger but if you have a ton of inflammation then it's not going to do anything right?

PATIENT S782
It'll clean it out huh?

DOCTOR S782
Right or we can get rid of the inflammation but if your airway is still teeny tiny that's not gonna help either.

PATIENT S782
Right.

DOCTOR S782
So that's why you need both to kind of work together.

PATIENT S782
Okay.

DOCTOR S782
Um the albuterol, I know you're saying helps you, you seem to feel like it but the albuterol is supposed to be only as needed and we try to make it so that you're other medications control your breathing so that you only need albuterol maybe once or twice a month if even.

PATIENT S782
Right.

DOCTOR S782
Cause albuterol is not supposed to be like a daily or even weekly thing.  We try to keep it to a minimum cause if you're having to use it every day or you know almost every day that means you're not well controlled enough with your other stuff.

PATIENT S782
Okay now do they have anything that you can get a breathing treatment with at home?

DOCTOR S782
Yeah, I think so.  You like the breathing treatments you get in the hospital?

PATIENT S782
Yeah sometimes.  Yeah they work.

DOCTOR S782
With the humidifier.

PATIENT S782
Yeah they got something you can take that at home.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah I think so, let me find out for you.

PATIENT S782
Okay.

DOCTOR S782
I'm pretty sure there is yeah.

PATIENT S782
And uh.

DOCTOR S782
What is your um, have you been checking your um blood sugar?

PATIENT S782
Oh yes, it's uh I'm starting to get it back under control now, but when I went into the hospital they would give, all they would give me is short-acting insulin.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.  Unfortunately you know the hospital.  So what are you taking right now?

PATIENT S782
15.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
Of long-acting.

DOCTOR S782
Okay, once a day or twice a day?

PATIENT S782
Twice a day.

DOCTOR S782
Twice a day.

PATIENT S782
And 15 of fast-acting.

DOCTOR S782
Okay with each meal.

PATIENT S782
Right.

DOCTOR S782
Okay and what are your morning sugars looking like?

PATIENT S782
I got them back down to 90 or 120.

DOCTOR S782
Good, wonderful.

PATIENT S782
You know uh anytime it's above 90 and 120, that mean I don't woke up eating something.

DOCTOR S782
Oh okay.

PATIENT S782
(Laughter)

DOCTOR S782
At least.

PATIENT S782
With eggs then I wake up in the morning and I'll check and maybe 160.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah do you write them down?

PATIENT S782
No I don't.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.  Well, do you think you can start writing them down and then we'll set you up with our pharmacists so they can take a good look at it and see if there's room to go up because your A1c which is the number we use to follow your diabetes.

PATIENT S782
Right.

DOCTOR S782
Shot way up.

PATIENT S782
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah it was, its 9., let me make sure so I'm not lying to you what it is, it is 9.3 when you had lab work done last week.

PATIENT S782
Okay.

DOCTOR S782
It was 7.4 in July.

PATIENT S782
So it went up 2 points.

DOCTOR S782
So way, way off in the wrong direction.

PATIENT S782
Well why would it, why would it made it do that?

DOCTOR S782
It's probably a combination of a lot of different things.  I think because you were in and out of the hospital a lot since July.

PATIENT S782
Maybe it's been since July once or twice.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah, yeah, in September or whatever.  So usually there's not too terribly good control there and then um I don't know what else has been going on, I don't know if you've been having missing meals or eating too much sweets or this and that, little things can always do it.

PATIENT S782
Oh okay.  Well that's a task; I'll get it back down.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.

PATIENT S782
That last one was just a little score right?

DOCTOR S782
The 7 yes, 7 is the goal, if we get it down to 7 for the A1c.  Um so why don't, if you can why don't you or actually does your monitor keep um.

PATIENT S782
The date and time.

DOCTOR S782
Does it keep track of it?

PATIENT S782
Yeah.

DOCTOR S782
So you don't even need to write down.

PATIENT S782
I brought it into her last week.

DOCTOR S782
Oh you did?  Did you bring @@@?

PATIENT S782
Yeah, I seen them once a week.

DOCTOR S782
For the warfarin .

PATIENT S782
For the blood thinner, right.

DOCTOR S782
And did they check your?

PATIENT S782
She checked it.  She told me just what you said keep a log.

DOCTOR S782
Oh okay, okay.

PATIENT S782
Keep a log and write down what I eat.

DOCTOR S782
Good, good.

PATIENT S782
You know cause.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah I mean for you, I mean you come in and seem them like once a week right?

PATIENT S782
Yeah they adjust my warfarin.

DOCTOR S782
Okay, okay, so then it seems like they kind of check on your diabetes as well.

PATIENT S782
That too.  

DOCTOR S782
Good.

PATIENT S782
They do that.

DOCTOR S782
Good okay.

PATIENT S782
They uh, you know they do all that, you know.

DOCTOR S782
Good, good.

PATIENT S782
Are you gonna be my permanent doctor or?

DOCTOR S782
We're gonna try.  We can try to make it that way um, we kind of switch around a lot.  So we try to keep seeing the same patient over and over but every now and then it, we have to.

PATIENT S782
Yeah cause I had one doctor he left.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.

PATIENT S782
He was my doctor for almost a year.

DOCTOR S782

DOCTOR S782

PATIENT S782
And we ended up having a little thing you know and then I got another friend, he spoke good of that doc too with his doctor.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
So you know, he was alright, I hate to see him go.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah.

PATIENT S782

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
This oxygen, they got more modern stuff than this but the VA they won't give it to you.  They got some equipment that keep you out, where you can stay out for eight hours.

DOCTOR S782

PATIENT S782
You know that's the first thing I did when I went out and bought those cigarettes.

DOCTOR S782
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S782
Got back in the car, opened them up and smoked it.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT S782
Those things are the devil.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah, and donâ€™t smoke around the oxygen either.

PATIENT S782
Yeah well I don't have it on, you know I ain't crazy.

DOCTOR S782
Either way, I mean there could be like a small leak that you don't know about I mean.

PATIENT S782
Don't you know that can happen to me before?

DOCTOR S782
Right, you're increases your changes.

PATIENT S782
But I don't do that no more, with those cigarettes, back to those cigarettes.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.

PATIENT S782
That's the hardest thing I ever had to do, quit smoking cigarettes.

DOCTOR S782
Yes, yeah no I can understand.  Alright, I'll be back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  85:58  DOCTOR IN: 98:24)

DOCTOR S782
Okay.  So you can get those nebulizers at home, I can order it.  So the actual medication you pick up from the Pharmacy but the actual equipment to do a nebulizer.

PATIENT S782
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S782
You can get from Prosthetics.

PATIENT S782
Okay.

DOCTOR S782
So let me put this in.  You'll probably like those better anyway huh.

PATIENT S782
Yeah.

DOCTOR S782
That seems to work better for you.

PATIENT S782
Well you know it makes it seem like it do how.

DOCTOR S782
No I mean it works differently.

PATIENT S782
Yeah.

DOCTOR S782
So um it's called Combivent and it's a brand name but it's a combination of albuterol and ipratropium.  I don't know what the name is.

PATIENT S782
Oh that's what this supposed to be?

DOCTOR S782
Yeah that's what the nebulizer treatment is.

PATIENT S782
Then you do it once a night, at night before you go to bed.

DOCTOR S782
Three times a day.

PATIENT S782
Three times a day.

DOCTOR S782
Yeah uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah if you want um I mean if you go and leave the house a lot I can prescribe the nebulizer and the inhaler then you can do nebulizers only at night and do the inhalers during the day.

PATIENT S782
Yeah.

DOCTOR S782
How would that sound?

PATIENT S782
That's alright.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.

PATIENT S782
Cause I don't want to sit up in the house.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.  So why don't we, um we'll plan on um doing the inhalers um during the daytime.

PATIENT S782
Alright.

DOCTOR S782
And do the nebulizers at night.

PATIENT S782
Okay.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.

PATIENT S782
But usually we like to say like every six hours or so but you know I mean people are busy.  I doubt anyone ever gets every six hours but if you can get it in three or four times a day that'd be ideal.

DOCTOR S782
Okay.  So let make sure you get that and then continue the mometasone.  Do you need refills on that?

PATIENT S782
The who now?

DOCTOR S782
Mometasone, that's the new one that you got.

PATIENT S782
