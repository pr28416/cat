DOCTOR D107
Come on back.

PATIENT D107
Okay.

DOCTOR D107
How you doing?  Good to see you.  What's new?  What's new?

PATIENT D107
What's new?  I got a sore throat.

DOCTOR D107
You got a sore throat huh?

PATIENT D107
Yeah overnight.  Something that and I got a back ache every morning.  I was here a month ago.

DOCTOR D107
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D107
And I had a different doctor, you weren't available I guess so.

DOCTOR D107
Okay.

PATIENT D107
Anyway uh, the hardest part is in the morning when I get up.

DOCTOR D107
Backache?

PATIENT D107
It's above the back and it goes from both sides.

DOCTOR D107
Okay.  What did they do when they saw you?

PATIENT D107
They took an x-ray.

DOCTOR D107
A what?

PATIENT D107
X-ray.

DOCTOR D107
Of what?

PATIENT D107
Of my hip and my back and uh at the time I told them I think that I had taken Advil but it was Aleve.

DOCTOR D107
Okay.

PATIENT D107
So he says to take one in the morning and one at night.  Well I stopped doing that after a while and the last three, four nights now I take one Aleve in the evening, you know at bedtime.

DOCTOR D107
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D107
Well.

DOCTOR D107
Does it help?

PATIENT D107
Uh well, it appears to be a little bit, but the hardest part.  During the day I can live with it.

DOCTOR D107
Bilateral.

PATIENT D107
It doesn't affect me during the day but the hardest part is getting up, when I get up in the morning, just out of bed.

DOCTOR D107
Um do you have any sort of aching, do you have aching in the morning?

PATIENT D107
It hurts.

DOCTOR D107
On the side, or in the middle.

PATIENT D107
It's the side and it's been on both sides.  It'll go from one side to the other.

DOCTOR D107
Now is this in the same place you have here because you had that surgery done about six years ago.

PATIENT D107
Yes.

DOCTOR D107
Is it in the same spot?

PATIENT D107
I don't think so, I thought that was on, this is more on like now, the last couple days it's on the right side and I did come in for the colonoscopy.

DOCTOR D107
Let's see we had little, well they checked your urine and that was fine.  You're having no problems urinating right?

PATIENT D107
Correct.

DOCTOR D107
And then no fever or chills?

PATIENT D107
Nope.

DOCTOR D107
Now, hold on one second.  So what you were just saying, you had your colonoscopy.

PATIENT D107
Yes I did.

DOCTOR D107
When was that done?

PATIENT D107
A month ago, well maybe a little more.  A month ago I was seen here for the back so, maybe two months.

DOCTOR D107
Two months.

PATIENT D107
I'm not positive but.

DOCTOR D107
Uh-huh. 

PATIENT D107
Shortly after you arranged for it.

DOCTOR D107
Now you said that the back issues, they started about a month ago?

PATIENT D107
It started in July really, 4th of July.

DOCTOR D107
So you get back pain on the side.  Point to me, show me where it is.

PATIENT D107
It's right in here.

DOCTOR D107
Okay.

PATIENT D107
It's not directly in the back.

DOCTOR D107
Did you recently, were you lifting things, were you doing anything like that, nothing new?

PATIENT D107
Nothing out of the ordinary.

DOCTOR D107
Worse in the morning but it goes away by the end of the day?

PATIENT D107
During the day I'm fine, it doesn't affect me.

DOCTOR D107
So when you wake up how long does it last for?

PATIENT D107
Uh till I get in gear.  I sit.

DOCTOR D107
So about an hour, two hours, how long?

PATIENT D107
Oh ten minutes, maybe even less.  But it's just the idea of getting up.

DOCTOR D107
Yeah.

PATIENT D107
Sitting up and then and trying to get up because it hurts just getting up into a sitting position.

DOCTOR D107
You have no problem specifically getting up?

PATIENT D107
No except for the pain of the back, inside the back or whatever you want to call it.  But it has seemed to alleviate a little bit.

DOCTOR D107
No numbness or tingling in your legs or your hands?

PATIENT D107
No.

DOCTOR D107
And then no loss of bowel or bladder?

PATIENT D107
Nope.

DOCTOR D107
No weight loss?

PATIENT D107
I don't believe so.  I may have lost two or three pounds.

DOCTOR D107
Nothing big.

PATIENT D107
Nothing.

DOCTOR D107
No night sweats?

PATIENT D107
No.

DOCTOR D107
You said no fever or chills.

PATIENT D107
Correct.

DOCTOR D107
No nausea, vomiting?

PATIENT D107
No sir.

DOCTOR D107
Okay and then um right now you would have no problems turning, walking?

PATIENT D107
No, no.  Uh the hips are beginning to have a little pain in them when I start walking, you know when I walk.  I mean I would walk without no problem and now my hips, both of them, are kind of sore.

DOCTOR D107
Um and then does the medication you're taking help?

PATIENT D107
It seems to have helped somewhat.  I was going to ask you, which would you recommend, Aleve, Advil, Tylenol or which?

DOCTOR D107
Now do you have any problems with your stomach?

PATIENT D107
No.

DOCTOR D107
Um typically if this is just for arthritis um, you know you have a history of lower back pain, osteoporosis, so this could just be degenerative.  But let me look at the films real quick.  If it's just that I would recommend probably anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen.  But you've never had any bleeds?

PATIENT D107
Bleeding?

DOCTOR D107
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D107
No.

DOCTOR D107
Um if you have then we can recommend another type.  But you've never had any stomach problems?

PATIENT D107
No.

DOCTOR D107
Or you don't have any heart problems or kidney problems right?

PATIENT D107
I hope not, not to my knowledge anyway.

DOCTOR D107
Yeah.  And you just have, you have hypertension and gout, uh high blood pressure.  Okay you don't seem to have any of the other ones.  You're just on the simvastatin, lisinopril, folic acid um vitamin B12, the alendronate and the aspirin and calcium right?

PATIENT D107
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D107
Take a look at the imaging, spine and lumbar.  Worsening compression deformity, extensive degenerative changes with a lot of osteophytes.  Okay.  Well basically what that means is you have quite a bit of um, quite a bit of degenerative changes.  My guess is those degenerative changes, in which case the anti-inflammatory should work the best, for you so ibuprofen.  How much ibuprofen have you been taking?

PATIENT D107
I haven't.  This Aleve.

DOCTOR D107
Why not?  Oh you're taking Aleve?

PATIENT D107
Well I've taken it the last three to four days.  I've taken Aleve one at night.

DOCTOR D107
That's it?  Oh you can take.

PATIENT D107
Well.

DOCTOR D107
Uh take it in the morning when you wake up.  Cause when you go to sleep it's just going to wear off in a few hours and when you wake up, let's say if you're having problems in the morning then um.

PATIENT D107
But then during the day I don't have any problems.

DOCTOR D107
Then don't take any during the day.  You only take them when you have problems.  So I would say only take them when you notice that you have some problems there okay.  Does that make sense?

PATIENT D107
So the only problem I have is when I get up, like I say.

DOCTOR D107
Right, yeah I think, so what I would say is when you get up, maybe take them when you get up and then if you don't have any symptoms during the day then great.

PATIENT D107
I don't have it without the pill in the morning.  

DOCTOR D107
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D107
I only take it at night thinking that in the morning it might be better.

DOCTOR D107
Sure.  Well yeah, exactly.  In the morning um, when you have the pain that's when you take the medicine.

PATIENT D107
Okay.

DOCTOR D107
In other words take the medicine when you have pain.

PATIENT D107
Alright.

DOCTOR D107
Does that make sense?

PATIENT D107
Sure.

DOCTOR D107
Okay, let's see here.  Let's see the last time, so I actually saw you in June.

PATIENT D107
Well you told me you wanted to see me in three months.

DOCTOR D107
Yeah no I was just trying to remember when the last time was that I saw you.

PATIENT D107
And since then I came in for the colonoscopy and then I came in for.

DOCTOR D107
Oh great.

PATIENT D107
Because of my back pain problem.

DOCTOR D107
And what else and you had just recently been diagnosed with diabetes?

PATIENT D107
I have?

DOCTOR D107
No back then.

PATIENT D107
If I have, I haven't been told.

DOCTOR D107
What's that?  Well no we told you that you had recently high blood sugars right?

PATIENT D107
Well the last time I came here you asked for a blood test and a urine test.

DOCTOR D107
Correct.

PATIENT D107
That was the last; I'm not taking anything for diabetes.

DOCTOR D107
Right.  Well this one the idea is in your hemoglobin A1c was how we measure your potential diabetes.  Your hemoglobin A1c was 5.9 which is really good.  Let me look at the old one because let me just take a quick look at.  I think one of your labs was off and then we rechecked it and your hemoglobin A1c was 5.9, that's really good.  You're spilling some protein in your urine which was um, let's go over this.  So that was fine.  Your kidney function is doing okay.

PATIENT D107
And you know you had me here taking the eye test, I did that two or three times when I came in to that and they told me to come back in a year.

DOCTOR D107
And we checked your, let's see we checked your cholesterol in November of 09.  Your total was 177, your HDL was 75 and your LDL, yeah so your cholesterol looks really good.  See the sugars that we took were high but your hemoglobin A1c was okay, so I think we won't, basically we're just not going to start you on anything but you're kind of on the borderline of diabetes.

PATIENT D107
Okay.

DOCTOR D107
Okay.  Okay, okay and then um we talked about the colonoscopy and you ended up getting it.

PATIENT D107
Correct.

DOCTOR D107
And the good news is you don't need to get any more.

PATIENT D107
Wonderful.

DOCTOR D107
What's that?

PATIENT D107
Wonderful.

DOCTOR D107
Was it uh.

PATIENT D107
No it wasn't bad.  I mean the worst part is before.

DOCTOR D107
You had a little external hemorrhoids, that's about it, so diverticulosis, okay.  And let's looks at your immunizations.  You should probably be up on your immunizations.

PATIENT D107
Is the flu shot in already?

DOCTOR D107
Not yet unfortunately.  We’re still waiting for that darn flu shot.  Now do you want the zoster vaccine, remember we talked about it last time?

PATIENT D107
What is that one for?

DOCTOR D107
For when, or if you were to get the shingles.

PATIENT D107
I took that, I had that, I did get that shot.

DOCTOR D107
Oh you did?

PATIENT D107
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR D107
Oh it was the Pneumovax right.

PATIENT D107
Yeah that I got.

DOCTOR D107
Okay, oh no you need the zoster and you just got the pneumonia one.  You need the zoster one for the shingles.

PATIENT D107
I thought it was for the shingles.

DOCTOR D107
When was that?

PATIENT D107
I don't know, at least a year ago if not longer.

DOCTOR D107
I really don't have it in here.

PATIENT D107
Because.

DOCTOR D107
Okay.

PATIENT D107
Because I think.

DOCTOR D107
At least you think you got it.

PATIENT D107
You told me that uh if you do get it, it shouldn't be as severe as.

DOCTOR D107
Exactly and you think you've gotten it.

PATIENT D107
I have gotten it.

DOCTOR D107
Huh.  I wonder why it doesn't show it.

PATIENT D107
I had one done.

DOCTOR D107
You said you've already had one okay.  Well did you have some back pain right there?

PATIENT D107
Not really, it's just, that's the way I get up now.

DOCTOR D107
Why is that?

PATIENT D107
Oh well, old age I call it, I don't know.  But there have, in the past, like when I came here a month ago to see the other docs, I mean I had a hard time getting up.  It was really painful.

DOCTOR D107
You hadn't, you did do, no lifting.

PATIENT D107
No.

DOCTOR D107
Or nothing like that.

PATIENT D107
And it's, now like I said it has subsided considerably.

DOCTOR D107
But no weight loss?

PATIENT D107
Not to speak of.

DOCTOR D107
Okay and no night sweats and you're eating well?

PATIENT D107
Yes.  Maybe too much.

DOCTOR D107
You're eating well.  What's that?

PATIENT D107
Maybe too much.

DOCTOR D107
Maybe too much?

PATIENT D107
Right.  

DOCTOR D107
Okay, I'll take a listen to you.

PATIENT D107
You want the shirt off or?

DOCTOR D107
Um, no you’re good.

PATIENT D107
Okay.

DOCTOR D107
What do you do for uh, what did you do for a living?

PATIENT D107
I worked at the lumber yard.

DOCTOR D107
Oh that's right.

PATIENT D107
For 32 years.

DOCTOR D107
Right.

PATIENT D107
And then I was the equipment man at the high school @@@.

DOCTOR D107
Oh I forgot about that.  Good.  Your blood pressure was a little better when I checked it than when the nurse checked it.

PATIENT D107
Good for you.  I think next time I’ll go by you.

DOCTOR D107
What's that?

PATIENT D107
Next time I’ll go by you.

DOCTOR D107
Right.  Deep breaths.  In and out.  In and out.  In and out.  Good.  Where is the pain, point to me where the pain is?

PATIENT D107
It's right in here.

DOCTOR D107
If I push in does it hurt?

PATIENT D107
No.  It's more on the side, but it's above the belt line.

DOCTOR D107
Point to me where it is.

PATIENT D107
It's right in through here.

DOCTOR D107
Now does that hurt?

PATIENT D107
No.

DOCTOR D107
No.

PATIENT D107
No, like I said the only time it really hurts is.

DOCTOR D107
Give me your hand.

PATIENT D107
When I uh get up in the morning.

DOCTOR D107
You've never had any other signs of osteoarthritis?

PATIENT D107
Not that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR D107
Okay squeeze but not too hard, good.  Lift up, lift pull, good.  When was the last time you saw an eye doctor?

PATIENT D107
When I was here.

DOCTOR D107
How recently?

PATIENT D107
Uh it'd be four months ago now.

DOCTOR D107
Oh four months ago.  No ulcers on your feet?

PATIENT D107
No what?

DOCTOR D107
Ulcers on your feet?

PATIENT D107
No.

DOCTOR D107
Now did they do, they did something in 2002, but they did a colonoscopy in 2002?  Oh I see you had tubular adenoma that's why.  But did the colonoscopy in 2002 as well huh?

PATIENT D107
Yes.

DOCTOR D107
And 2010.

PATIENT D107
I had it three, this is the third time I had it done.

DOCTOR D107
Yeah did they not take any biopsies this time?

PATIENT D107
Uh evidently not.

DOCTOR D107
Okay.

PATIENT D107
If they did the, all I got is the letter stating that the colon is normal.

DOCTOR D107
Okay.

PATIENT D107
That's all I got and like you said the hemorrhoids were there.

DOCTOR D107
Yeah okay sir I'll be right back, give me a few minutes.

PATIENT D107
Can I put this back in?

DOCTOR D107
Yeah of course, yes.

(DOCTOR OUT:  43:15  DOCTOR IN:  54:38)

DOCTOR D107
Alright.  Well the good news is you're doing great.

PATIENT D107
Thank you.

DOCTOR D107
Um I think really the only thing that we would need to do is obviously if you have worsening pain just let me know.  If you start having fevers, night sweats, chills, weight loss, worsening pain let me know.  I think this is all just degenerative changes in your spine.  You can take ibuprofen.

PATIENT D107
Any particular brand would be recommended?

DOCTOR D107
Aleve is fine.

PATIENT D107
Aleve isn’t ibuprofen.

DOCTOR D107
You can take that too, that's not important.

PATIENT D107
That's better than Advil or Tylenol?

DOCTOR D107
Yeah.

PATIENT D107
Same thing?

DOCTOR D107
Well the Tylenol is not the same thing.

PATIENT D107
Oh.

DOCTOR D107
But uh ibuprofen are.

PATIENT D107
Well I, personally I don't like to take anything.

DOCTOR D107
Right, well if it doesn't bother you very much then you don't have to.

PATIENT D107
Like I say.

DOCTOR D107
But if you have problems well then take it.

PATIENT D107
Okay.

DOCTOR D107
Um obviously if you have any worsening symptoms let us know.  Uh all your labs are pretty much up-to-date.  We really don't need to do any labs until probably six, seven months from now.

PATIENT D107
Great.

DOCTOR D107
Flu shot, as soon as they come in they'll give you a mass mailing and you can come in to get it.

PATIENT D107
Okay.

DOCTOR D107
And then I don't think you need to see me for six months unless something pops up, in which case you just call up and let me know and we'll see you earlier.  How does that sound?

PATIENT D107
Thank you very much.

DOCTOR D107
You're welcome.  That was an easy, easy solution.  

PATIENT D107
I hope so. Yeah.

DOCTOR D107
Nice to see you.  

PATIENT D107
Alright.

DOCTOR D107
Have a good evening.

PATIENT D107
Doc.

DOCTOR D107
Did you bring anything?

PATIENT D107
I didn't bring anything.

DOCTOR D107
Okay.  (Doctor talking with someone else)

PATIENT D107
I should get that sent to the house correct?

DOCTOR D107
Yeah absolutely.

PATIENT D107
Thank you sir.
