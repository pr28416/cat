But the thing was, at the beginning of the year January her whole hospital changed from HMO, Blue Cross Blue Shield to Aetna.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.

PATIENT A565
And they dropped me.

DOCTOR A565
Oh so now you're coming here okay.  So were you looking at something.

Um I woke up one morning at home and I had water on my lungs, I couldn't catch my breath.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.

So my wife took me to the nearest hospital which is St. Margaret's.  I live in Dawson.

DOCTOR A565
Okay and you've never had this happen before right?

PATIENT A565
No uh I'm taking dialysis now and uh I went to St. James out in Rowland Park.  They gave me a pacemaker.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.

PATIENT A565
And I'm taking uh dialysis.  They just put a stent in my arm so I can take it in my arm and not in my hip.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  When was that?

PATIENT A565
Uh the stent was put in two Tuesdays ago and the Pharmacy won't fill the prescription unless I see my doctor first.

DOCTOR A565
Uh-huh, okay.  @@@.  Did you get a biopsy done?

PATIENT A565
I was scheduled to have it done but I'm already on dialysis @@@.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  Just reading up on the hospitalization.

PATIENT A565
Okay.

DOCTOR A565
Did you get an echocardiogram done here?

PATIENT A565
I had one done the last time I was in the hospital here.

DOCTOR A565
So was it here?

PATIENT A565
Yes sir.

DOCTOR A565
Let's look.  So from here on out would you start having your primary care doctor here or would it be outside?

PATIENT A565
Uh my primary doctor's always been out here I just used her insurance card because she didn't want to travel.

DOCTOR A565
Right.

PATIENT A565
We live in Dalton a far south suburb so.

DOCTOR A565
I understand.

PATIENT A565
So she didn't want to drive all the way over here to get me in Emergency here.

DOCTOR A565
No I understand.

PATIENT A565
As long as I feel pretty decent now, I always bring myself here.

DOCTOR A565
Hmm.  Um any recent shortness of breath or that's good okay.

PATIENT A565
I @@@ where I'm at.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  There you go then.  @@@ November at least.  Have they diagnosed you with heart failure?

PATIENT A565
At St. James.

DOCTOR A565
They did?

PATIENT A565
Yeah that's why they put the new pacemaker in here.

DOCTOR A565
What did they say was your um ejection fraction?  Do you remember that?

PATIENT A565
No sir.

DOCTOR A565
Now is that a pacemaker or a defibrillator?

PATIENT A565
Oh.

DOCTOR A565
Do you have card or anything?  

PATIENT A565
Yes. Does it tell you which one it is?

DOCTOR A565
Um I got to look this up and all.  Um when was this placed?

PATIENT A565
Uh December the 23rd.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  They said that you had a slower heart rate during the hospitalization?

PATIENT A565
Right.

DOCTOR A565
Oh a slow heartbeat.

PATIENT A565
That's it.

DOCTOR A565
So that's what it was, okay.  Did they send documents over here, do you know?

PATIENT A565
Um there was a problem with me getting an appointment.

DOCTOR A565
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A565
They kept putting me back in March and then it was April and I bet they haven't really sent any of my records in there.

DOCTOR A565
Now would the dialysis @@@

PATIENT A565
Yes that was on the same @@@.  This was done at St. James.

DOCTOR A565
Hmm.

PATIENT A565
And I was asking them well why did they put it in my chest they said cause I had to have it right away, I got to start doing dialysis right away.

DOCTOR A565
For the dialysis okay.

PATIENT A565
So they put the first on in and said in about three or four weeks when this gets well.

DOCTOR A565
So let's say in a month how many times have you been hospitalized?

PATIENT A565
Uh last year was the most in my life.

DOCTOR A565
Yeah.

PATIENT A565
I think it was about four times.

DOCTOR A565
Okay so let's, I just want to get an idea of when things were happening. So you, as of, in November you weren't on dialysis right.  You didn't have the pacemaker, you didn't have okay.

PATIENT A565
I didn’t go on dialysis till December.

DOCTOR A565
So what happened in December?

PATIENT A565
Uh.

DOCTOR A565
Was that the same time with the heart issues or @@@.

PATIENT A565
Yes. My legs were you know I couldn't get my shoes on and my feet were swelling and my legs were swelling.

DOCTOR A565
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A565
My arms was getting fat so my wife got real nervous and took me straight to the hospital.

DOCTOR A565
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A565
At St. James.

DOCTOR A565
So at St. James.

PATIENT A565
Right.

DOCTOR A565
Uh they said that your kidneys weren't really working right?

PATIENT A565
Yes that's what it was there.  I know they took a lot of blood and uh then they said I have kidney failure they said it's kicking on and off.

DOCTOR A565
Yeah.

PATIENT A565
But it's supposed to work 24 hours a day but it wasn't so.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.

PATIENT A565
They put me on the dialysis right away.

DOCTOR A565
So the dialysis.

PATIENT A565
And I felt better.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.

PATIENT A565
Then in January I was at home.

DOCTOR A565
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A565
And uh I woke up that morning and uh my wife was in her room with the grandbaby and uh I couldn't catch my breath.

DOCTOR A565
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A565
So she uh called 911, they took me to St. Margaret which is close to my home.

DOCTOR A565
Right.

PATIENT A565
And they gave, they took off four liters of fluid that Sunday I went then the next Monday they took another four, so they took off about eight.

DOCTOR A565
Eight liters so that was.

PATIENT A565
Right and the doctor there suggested that I go to dialysis across the street from St. Margaret's.

DOCTOR A565
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A565
Da Vita.

DOCTOR A565
At Da Vita and that's where you've been doing it?

PATIENT A565
Yes.

DOCTOR A565
How often?

PATIENT A565
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  Now, can you still do that without your wife's insurance or?

PATIENT A565
Right uh I was on disability.

DOCTOR A565
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A565
Uh DOCTOR put me on disability many years ago.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  So you were able to get the dialysis.

PATIENT A565
Right.

DOCTOR A565
I just wanted to make sure @@@ dialysis okay.  Are they going to continue following you for dialysis or do they want you to be followed here?

PATIENT A565
No I'd rather be out there, it's closer to home.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.

PATIENT A565
It's quite a drive to come from Dalton over here.

DOCTOR A565
Right.  So you're able to with your insurance.

PATIENT A565
Yes sir.

DOCTOR A565
Yeah if you're able to do that alright it's just for the primary stuff that you need to be here?

PATIENT A565
Yes sir.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  

PATIENT A565
I'm a long time patient of DOCTOR in Rheumatology you know.

DOCTOR A565
Yeah he's a good guy um.

PATIENT A565
Yeah he's real sharp.

DOCTOR A565
Okay so after, at this the hospitalization on the 12th they also told you that you have heart failure?  But we can check on the pacemaker.

PATIENT A565
That was at St. James where they uh.

DOCTOR A565
In December, right okay.

PATIENT A565
Right.

DOCTOR A565
But they did the pacemaker that month too?

PATIENT A565
Yeah December the 23rd.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.

PATIENT A565
Cause I wanted to go home for Christmas and they kept me, they put that in and had to keep me in observation then they gave me blood, two pints of blood.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  Alright so basically three hospitalizations that we're talking about since November okay.

PATIENT A565
Yeah.

DOCTOR A565
@@@.  It's, I just want to make sure I got everything straight.  Sometimes things can slip a little bit and uh you know it's good just to have all of this documented.  So you ran out of and uh in January, mid January they gave you all your medications so it was just for 30 days right?  Is that right?

PATIENT A565
Yes.

DOCTOR A565

PATIENT A565
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:22  DOCTOR IN:  60:56)

DOCTOR A565
Hey.  So I'd like to ask a couple of questions. In terms of this medication list.

PATIENT A565
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A565
Were you getting your medications at the other hospitals or were you always getting your medications here?

PATIENT A565
I was always getting them here.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  Um because some of these were expired so I don't know if you were still taking them or not.  What I want to do um, yeah instead of refilling everything what are the things that you.

PATIENT A565
Those are the things I need right there on the @@@ list.

DOCTOR A565
Yeah I think that you have refills for most of them.

PATIENT A565
Right.

DOCTOR A565
But so the only thing was the Docusate.

PATIENT A565
Docusate yeah.

DOCTOR A565
I'm just gonna look here.  Where did you get the metoprolol from, was it here?

PATIENT A565
No the last time I was out I had to go to Walgreens.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.

PATIENT A565
That's going back here.

DOCTOR A565
@@@ prescribe that.

PATIENT A565
Uh I think it was at St. Margaret's.  I know I sound vague @@@ you know my wife handles a lot of this stuff you know.

DOCTOR A565
Yeah.  Well the, it's I mean I guess as long as you're taking, if you're getting all your medical care here it helps to have you getting them in one place.  You know because it's impossible for you to know some of the things that happen in other hospitals.

PATIENT A565
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A565
But to keep track of what medications they've given you okay so.

PATIENT A565
Okay.

DOCTOR A565
So the metoprolol we'll do that.

PATIENT A565
So I can go down to the Pharmacy and get that today?

DOCTOR A565
Yeah you can basically, metoprolol.

PATIENT A565
You put the Dulcolax in there?

DOCTOR A565
Yeah I'm gonna do that too um.  Okay the statin.

PATIENT A565
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A565
The atorvastatin.

PATIENT A565
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A565
And you can get it out there, oh it looks like you got it recently, you got that on the 24th uh.

PATIENT A565
I think what probably happened was the doctor prescribed it at 150 mg a day twice a day and I only got the 50 mg so I went right straight through it you know and that's why I'm almost out.  

DOCTOR A565
Okay.

PATIENT A565
And I need enough to make 150 mg a day.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  Do you have enough insulin or do you need the um?

PATIENT A565
Well according to the package it says that it's only filled for 28 days so.

DOCTOR A565
@@@.

PATIENT A565
I need the needles and the insulin.

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  And so these are the only things I'm going to refill for a month's supply.

PATIENT A565
Okay.

DOCTOR A565
What I want you to do is with your old um, yeah with whatever bottles you've been taking before okay.

PATIENT A565
Bring them back?

DOCTOR A565
Yeah I want you to bring them back to the Pharmacy.  Do you have that form that they gave you initially when you walked in?

PATIENT A565
The form?

DOCTOR A565
Yeah it's with your name and it's got all the stuff.

PATIENT A565
No they didn't give me a form.

DOCTOR A565
Uh Pharmacy visit, in one month okay.

PATIENT A565
Okay.  

DOCTOR A565
Or not one month sorry, one week, okay.

PATIENT A565

PATIENT A565

DOCTOR A565
Were you supposed to have an appointment with them any time soon?

PATIENT A565

DOCTOR A565
Okay.  Well so you need to try to make that appointment okay.

PATIENT A565
Okay.

DOCTOR A565
So we'll do that.  Now with the pacemaker they want you to see the cardiologist over there or did they say for you to have a cardiologist here?

PATIENT A565
Um I think I was supposed to take a stress test out there.  I seem vague about this, but my wife is the one @@@ make the appointment @@@.

DOCTOR A565
So basically if you're seeing a cardiologist there you can continue seeing them.

PATIENT A565
Hmm.

DOCTOR A565

PATIENT A565
Okay.
