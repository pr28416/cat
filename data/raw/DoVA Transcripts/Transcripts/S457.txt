Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR S457
Hi there.  I'm DOCTOR come on back.  @@@.  How you feeling?

PATIENT S457
I feel pretty good.

DOCTOR S457
@@@.  Can I have your coat; I can hang it up for you?  Oh is that for your blood sugar?

PATIENT S457
It's a recording yep.

DOCTOR S457
Great, okay, gotcha.  Alright so how are you doing sir?

PATIENT S457
Okay, doing alright, getting by.

DOCTOR S457
Fabulous It's very good to see you.  You know the last time I saw you you were talking a lot about tiredness and having fatigue.

PATIENT S457
@@@ it hasn't left yet.

DOCTOR S457
Hasn't left yet huh.

PATIENT S457
@@@ cut that out because uh you know, because staggering a little bit.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah.  Been a little bit off balance?

PATIENT S457
Off balance.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah.

PATIENT S457
So @@@ no one sees.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT S457
(Laughter) So ain't gonna have you cut it out and @@@ I'm getting better.

DOCTOR S457
In what ways?  

PATIENT S457
Well I'm not staggering.  That's just about it.  Also um I noticed it takes more heat for me to get warm.

DOCTOR S457
Okay.

PATIENT S457
You know as compared to some of the other members of my family.

DOCTOR S457
Okay.  

PATIENT S457
Yeah, I don't know why.

DOCTOR S457
You use more blankets, that kind of thing?

PATIENT S457
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Have you been having any other symptoms like constipation or any skin changes.

PATIENT S457
No.

DOCTOR S457
Nothing like that, okay.  Um you know typically a couple of the things that we think about, I know you've had the trouble with the fatigue, trouble getting warm um.

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Those types of things can be related to endocrine issues, meaning hormone issues um.  But we have checked hormone levels including thyroid hormones.  Typically we think about when you express those symptoms and they were normal okay.  Well the last time we checked on it and it looks like even just last month, back in March and uh it looks fine.  Um other things we think about sometimes are anemia causing that, some tiredness, maybe increased coldness um but for anemia I believe it's, let me double check but I think it's been pretty stable if a little bit better over the last month.  They have been checking that when you come in for various appointments and you're pretty stable, not too low.  Okay your number right now is 12.7 so I think that's acceptable considering you know all the therapy you've been going through with the radiation and things like that.

PATIENT S457
What about the uh PSA?

DOCTOR S457
The PSA, another good question.  The PSA looks good.  Let me pull up your numbers for you so you can see them.  There you go um; we go back to all your results here at the VA.  When they became concerned with them was when they got up to 10.9 here back in December of 2008.

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Right now, after the treatment, it's down to 0.04 and they did a @@@ further treatment for that too, the androgen depravation therapy you're getting @@@ is that correct?  Um I'll double check for you yeah.  The thing they inject under your skin every three months.

PATIENT S457
Oh yeah, yeah, that's right yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Well I think we're making progress.  That's a major progress with that.  Your prostate levels are nothing right now so, that's what I think we're going to keep following to make sure you don't have any recurrence of the prostate cancer.  Okay.

PATIENT S457
Is @@@ that occurs in patients?

DOCTOR S457
Prostate cancer?

PATIENT S457
No I mean the reoccurrence.

DOCTOR S457
Oh reoccurrence um you know what from what I remember about you again, let me check my notes real quick again, um, yeah your prostate cancer it looks like they were able to do a good resection without any residual disease that they found outside the prostate itself.

PATIENT S457
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S457
So I think you know, given your age, uh where you are right now, they probably have a pretty good idea that you're doing to do well with it or they wouldn't have done the surgery.

PATIENT S457
Oh.

DOCTOR S457
Um you know I can't say with absolute certainty but I think you're gonna do okay.  Your levels have been fine for now.  You did finish the radiation um so we'll see how it goes from there and it's definitely something we'll follow okay.  How have things been going for you otherwise?

PATIENT S457
Oh just fine, fine.  Oh I try to lose weight, trying to get rid of this uh.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah.  

PATIENT S457
Well this stomach but uh.

DOCTOR S457
You feel like you’re too heavy?

PATIENT S457
Yeah I just want to slim down @@@.  See if I feel much better.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah.  You said you weren't quite as active now because you have the tiredness.

PATIENT S457
Tiredness.

DOCTOR S457
Kind of off balance.

PATIENT S457
Off balance.

DOCTOR S457
Well I would say hold off until you start feeling a little better.  I don't want you hurting yourself trying to do too much and right now you're at 230 pounds or so.

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
This is up for you definitely um.  We have you at 220 even back in October last year so you're up about 10 pounds.

PATIENT S457
My blood pressure is down.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah.

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457
Yeah it looks good.

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457

DOCTOR S457

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457
Okay.

PATIENT S457

PATIENT S457
Oh, that medicine, I haven't taken it cause my blood pressure went down.  What kind of pills?

DOCTOR S457
How far did it go down?

PATIENT S457
Around 120 and stuff like that.

DOCTOR S457

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457
Okay we'll stop it then okay.

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457
Okay.  Which ones do you want to get at Walgreens?

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457

PATIENT S457
Yeah but if it's the 120, 420 on the prescription.

DOCTOR S457

DOCTOR S457

PATIENT S457
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR S457
So uh you can just take that over-the-counter probably right?

PATIENT S457
Yeah it's 400 @@@.

DOCTOR S457
That's fine.  Do you want to just do that and I can take it off of your list over here?

PATIENT S457
Is 400 going to be okay?

DOCTOR S457
Yeah it'd be fine.

PATIENT S457
Fine.  And let's see is that the vitamin D?

DOCTOR S457
Is that the magnesium and.

PATIENT S457
Is that magnesium?

DOCTOR S457
And we've got let's see you said vitamin D but I don't have the prescription for you for vitamin D.

PATIENT S457
The vitamin D comes out as something else.

DOCTOR S457
Oh its thiamine yeah you're right.  The calcium and vitamin D.

PATIENT S457
The calcium.

DOCTOR S457
You want to just get that at Walgreens then?

PATIENT S457

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457
Okay good.  We'll do calcium um alright @@@.  Anything bothering you today, anything we need to talk about specifically?

PATIENT S457
No.

DOCTOR S457
@@@.  Um let's see alright.  Well I'd like to focus a little bit on your off balance @@@ you know.  

PATIENT S457
That's @@@ going on you know, cause I'm not um putting myself in that position you know to @@@.  In other words, I maintain an awareness of this you know.

DOCTOR S457
You're able and have you ever almost fallen?

PATIENT S457
I think I've almost fallen yes sir.

DOCTOR S457
But does it feel like you're going to fall because the room is spinning?

DOCTOR S457
Anything like that.

PATIENT S457
@@@.

DOCTOR S457
Say it again?

PATIENT S457
Is that normal?

DOCTOR S457
Well it's not normal uh.  But it's not something unexpected though in somebody who you know you're an older gentleman.

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Who has gone through a lot recently with the radiation.

PATIENT S457
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR S457
You know I don't think that we can, we should downplay it though you know.  It's not abnormal for somebody who's been through what you've been through.  Have you had any problems with your bowel movements at all?

PATIENT S457
Not really.

DOCTOR S457
No trouble with losing your stools like before you get to the toilet or anything like that.

DOCTOR S457

DOCTOR S457
Okay how about trouble sleeping?

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457
Okay.

PATIENT S457
And I got rid of them and I lay my head on the middle ones and changed it out a little bit you know.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah.

PATIENT S457
More firmer ones I need to keep my head and my body at an even level.

DOCTOR S457
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S457
In other words flat.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah.

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457
Okay.

PATIENT S457
This other one, be much better then I sleep better.

DOCTOR S457
Okay.  Alright.  Do you mind if we go through your medicines then real quick and make sure you're taking everything and that we're not missing anything?

PATIENT S457
Okay.

DOCTOR S457
For your blood pressure you're on hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT S457
Yes.

DOCTOR S457
The losartan, losartan does that sound familiar?

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah and then you're not taking the atenolol, correct?  The new one we started.

PATIENT S457
Correct.

DOCTOR S457
You never started that one.

PATIENT S457
No I'm not taking it.  I was wondering what to do there, how do I take one half, it's already small.

DOCTOR S457
Is that the atenolol, don't worry about it you get rid of those okay.

PATIENT S457
Okay.

DOCTOR S457
Okay.  Um yeah I know they're hard to cut in half, it's inconvenient.

PATIENT S457
I @@@.

DOCTOR S457
For your uh cholesterol you're taking the simvastatin.

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
You're taking half a pill of that.

PATIENT S457
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR S457
A half a pill.

PATIENT S457
@@@.

DOCTOR S457
You're taking for the diabetes the metformin?

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
That one's twice a day.

PATIENT S457

DOCTOR S457
And then the @@@ we talked about that they put in the implant every three months.

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Okay.  Is there anything you're taking besides the vitamin supplements that we're missing?

PATIENT S457
No.

DOCTOR S457
Okay and then the aspirin.

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
The aspirin but you're getting that at Walgreens.  Okay.  

PATIENT S457
So I take a vitamin pill.

DOCTOR S457
Keep taking them, they're real good.

PATIENT S457
Okay.  I have to take those.

DOCTOR S457
Good, yeah.

PATIENT S457
You have diabetes.

DOCTOR S457 
Any diabetic changes anywhere?

PATIENT S457
I’m great.

DOCTOR S457
Okay, alright.

PATIENT S457
@@@.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah it looks like you have real minimal changes @@@.  Well keep doing what you're doing.  Alright and we did your foot exam last time.  You haven't noted any ulcers or changes in your feet or anything like that right?

PATIENT S457
Uh uh.

DOCTOR S457
Alright um alright.  @@@.

PATIENT S457
Yep.

DOCTOR S457
Your kidneys look to be doing real well.

PATIENT S457
Good.

DOCTOR S457
Alright.  Before we get to our physical exam uh the one thing that we can talk about is uh, that we haven’t done for you yet is a shingles shot.  Uh I think we've talked about it before but we didn't do it because you were undergoing radiation therapy um.  We talked about doing it uh for a couple of reasons.  Number one is it will reduce your incidence of getting shingles which is a skin condition you can get uh if you're immune system is @@@.  Basically it is a reactivation of a chicken pox virus that you had when you were a kid um cause whenever your immune system is weak, at an older in age it'll come back out and cause you pain um.  So I'd like to get you scheduled for one of those now that we can after the radiation if that's okay with you.

PATIENT S457
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR S457
Come on up here, I'll take a look at them okay.  There you go.

PATIENT S457
@@@.  I'm sore right here.  @@@.

DOCTOR S457
But you do have a little bruise there.

PATIENT S457
I don't know what it is or what the.

DOCTOR S457
It hurts right here?

PATIENT S457
Just a little bit yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Does it itch at all?

PATIENT S457
A little.

DOCTOR S457
A little.  How long have you noticed that for?

PATIENT S457
Uh it just came on about uh, about a week or so @@@.  I don't think @@@.

DOCTOR S457
Well you know if it persists or gets any bigger give me a call and we'll get you, or I can make another appointment for you.

PATIENT S457
Alright.

DOCTOR S457
Right.  We'll see what it is.  It may go away on it’s own. It looks like a little bit of a bruise there.

PATIENT S457
I think I know @@@.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT S457
No on the street.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah that's fine.  You're doing fine.  Let me see your fingers good.  I'll take a listen to you okay.

PATIENT S457
Alright.

DOCTOR S457
A couple deep breaths.  Good.  Again, again and one more.  Very good.  Breathe normally.  Can you feel it in the back when I'm pressing?

PATIENT S457
You know I sitting down, you know where I had a disc problem.  That's even getting better.

DOCTOR S457
And @@@.

PATIENT S457
@@@.

DOCTOR S457
Well um.  How do you feel about, what kind of food are you eating during the day?

PATIENT S457
Uh I eat uh vegetables and in the morning I eat uh cereal you know, the whole grain you know.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah.

PATIENT S457
And uh, collard greens, collard greens.

DOCTOR S457
Okay.  Well it sounds like you're eating pretty healthy.

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
I'd say keep doing what you're doing.  Try to you know, I don't know if you drink a lot of soda with sugar in it.

PATIENT S457
A little.

DOCTOR S457
Try to limit that.  Try to limit any fatty foods like um you know bacon or sausage or things like that, things that are fattening and kind of give you a little bit of extra weight sometimes.  But otherwise like I said I'm not dissatisfied with where your weight is.  It is up but I think getting through you know going through radiation and all that probably made you a little bit tired.  I expect the radiation; expect the tiredness should resolve in time and time being over a couple months.  You've only just finished the radiation a couple of weeks ago and I'd give you at least another couple months before we start thinking that something else might be going on.

PATIENT S457
Yeah I eat eggs.

DOCTOR S457
So eggs are high in cholesterol.  Your cholesterol has been fine when we checked it before.  Go ahead and have a seat and let me take a look at that.  You're taking that low dose of the cholesterol medicine right now and it looks like the last cholesterol we checked yeah was uh, your LDL the bad cholesterol was 68, the good cholesterol was 43 so I think you're doing just fine.  Whatever you been eating is probably okay.  Try to cut out some of the things like if you're having a lot of pasta anything like pasta or rice with each meal.

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Or daily if you're having like one helping of something like that daily, try to cut some of that out cause those can build up and turn into fat.

PATIENT S457
Potatoes or something like that.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah I mean within reason.

PATIENT S457
Okay.

DOCTOR S457
I wouldn't cut everything out because there's nothing good about that either but definitely things like potatoes, pasta, rice.  You eat too much of them can build up in your body as fats and sugars okay.

PATIENT S457
Okay.

DOCTOR S457
Alright so um and let's see, you did also get an echocardiogram for you.  I forgot to mention that.  That was completely normal.

PATIENT S457
It was.

DOCTOR S457
Completely normal.

PATIENT S457
@@@.

DOCTOR S457
Nothing wrong whatsoever.

PATIENT S457
I forgot to ask you about it but uh.

DOCTOR S457
You just got that done yesterday?

PATIENT S457
@@@.  

DOCTOR S457
Yeah no it looks completely normal.  It's pumping up just as much blood as my heart probably is okay.  So no problems with that.  That's not the cause of your tiredness.

PATIENT S457
They didn't tell me, it might sound like a washing machine (laughter).

DOCTOR S457
(Laughter).  Alright.  Well what other questions do you have, do you have any other questions?

PATIENT S457
No, no.

DOCTOR S457
Alright, anything else I can do for you today?

PATIENT S457
No.  No. I don’t think so.  I'm okay.

DOCTOR S457
Alright.  Um, I last saw you back in February, I wanted bring you back soon @@@.  I think we're probably going to see you again in a few months or so okay.  I'm going to go ahead and schedule you for four months out from here and I'm going to just double check, I don't think we need to even check anything here.  I'll need to check a blood sugar level but that's it.

PATIENT S457
I keep busy exercising and I think I've doing pretty good at this point.

DOCTOR S457
I would say keep doing what you're doing and don't overdo it because you do have some healing to do from the radiation but uh I think you're doing just fine and I want to emphasize that cause you know there is such a thing as doing too much too soon after cause it's kind of a draining period.

PATIENT S457
Oh.

DOCTOR S457
@@@ so uh but you know I think you're doing fine and I want you to keep doing what you're doing okay.  Alright.  You hang out here for a little bit.  I'm going to go talk to my clinic supervisor.

PATIENT S457
Okay.

DOCTOR S457
Actually one more thing before I leave I just want to double check about uh the one thing that we, I don't know if we talked about it, have you ever had a sleep study before?

PATIENT S457
What's that?

DOCTOR S457
A sleep study where they kind of watch you sleep and see if you snore.

PATIENT S457
Uh no but I heard years ago that I snore a little bit.

DOCTOR S457
You snore a little bit.

PATIENT S457
I also my nostrils tend to clog up.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah.

PATIENT S457
I take this uh, @@@ stuff that I get at Walgreens that you put in your nostrils @@@.

DOCTOR S457
@@@.  Is that just Ocean Mist or something like that?

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Saline @@@.

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
And that helped you?

PATIENT S457
It seems to but if there's something better I'd like to know what it is.

DOCTOR S457
If that's working I think you can keep doing that um.  You're not having any problems with it unless that stops working then we can change it but I think that's usually the first thing I'd recommend if you have some sinus dryness or some constant irritation in your nasal passage I think that's a good idea.

PATIENT S457
Okay.

DOCTOR S457
I'll put that on your outpatient list.  Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT S457
That's supposed to be @@@ better.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah, yeah you know if they have any suggestions go through them and you can give me a call and let me know what they think but I think if the saline nasal spray it working okay then I'd just keep going with that okay, alright.  Uh so the one thing we talked about was the sleep study.  Um sometimes if you snore a lot and you're kind of not getting good sleep because you stop breathing at times at night, it's a problem we call sleep apnea.  You can get tired during the day um.  If you @@@ get evaluated for that, I think it's fine if you want to do that and I would recommend it, just to complete our work-up to see if we can figure out why you're having this tiredness okay.

PATIENT S457
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR S457
Do you mind if I put that order in for you?

PATIENT S457
Right.  

DOCTOR S457
Alright so they can schedule that for you up front @@@.  Alright.  Any other questions or anything?

PATIENT S457
You were asking about @@@.

DOCTOR S457
Okay, let me go talk to my clinic supervisor if you'll wait in here for a little bit I'll be right back in okay.

PATIENT S457
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR S457
I'll just be a few minutes okay.

PATIENT S457
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR S457
I'll be back in just a second.

PATIENT S457
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  62:35  DOCTOR IN 70:40)

PATIENT S457
Hey how's it going?

DOCTOR S457
So um a couple things that we talked about, I just wanted to touch base with you about um, kind of going through your labs a little bit more.  Your vitamin D level was a little bit low the last time we checked it so I would like to give you a stronger prescription for vitamin D for now until I see you again.

PATIENT S457
Uh I, @@@ in spite of the fact that I get that.

DOCTOR S457
I'll give you a stronger one.

PATIENT S457
Oh a stronger one okay.

DOCTOR S457
And it's going to be a once weekly medication so pick a day like Sunday or something and take it on Sundays for three months until you see me again.

PATIENT S457
Okay.

DOCTOR S457
@@@ okay.  

PATIENT S457
@@@.

DOCTOR S457
Say again.

PATIENT S457
Do I still take the @@@?

DOCTOR S457
Um you don't have to no.

PATIENT S457
I don't have to take that.

DOCTOR S457
You don't have to that when you're taking this bigger pill okay.

PATIENT S457
What is this something @@@.

DOCTOR S457
The calcium.

PATIENT S457
Calcium.

DOCTOR S457
Uh I mean if you want to take it there's no problem with it I wouldn't say.

PATIENT S457
Oh no.

DOCTOR S457
But you don't have to.

PATIENT S457
I'm not going to take it then.

DOCTOR S457
Exactly.

PATIENT S457
What about the calcium?  

DOCTOR S457
We'll recheck that as soon as you’re done okay.  As soon as you're done with this bigger dose then.   Okay there will be a once-a-week pill okay.

PATIENT S457
I'm not quite clear on that, on the one that I'm taking now.

DOCTOR S457
So the one that you're taking now, the calcium and the vitamin D, the one that I'm going to prescribe to you is just vitamin D.  It's okay to do whatever you want with your pill with the calcium and vitamin D.  It's not going to give you too much vitamin D and you're not going to miss a whole lot of the calcium if you're not taking it okay.

PATIENT S457
If I'm not taking it.

DOCTOR S457
If you're not taking it it's not gonna be a big deal.

PATIENT S457
Okay.

DOCTOR S457
Okay.  So whichever you prefer if you want to keep taking it that's fine if you don't that's okay.

PATIENT S457
So I'm getting one at Walgreens, that's Silver @@@ call that.

DOCTOR S457
What's that, see if I remember.

PATIENT S457
Cause I mean this vitamin has vitamin D in that also.

DOCTOR S457
Uh-huh.  And I'll check labs for you in a few months as well okay.  So when you come in before the next appointment get that vitamin D level for me okay.

PATIENT S457
Okay and then you say this one I can discontinue it.

DOCTOR S457
You can stop it and the pill I'm giving you will be something you'll take for a couple months and then we'll stop it.

PATIENT S457
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S457
Okay we'll recheck your vitamin D level, if it's doing okay then we'll stop this one, the big pill that you take once a week and we'll restart this one.

PATIENT S457
Now the one I'm taking now I should stop that right now you said.

DOCTOR S457
Yeah.

PATIENT S457
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR S457
Um I'm also going to put in a couple other blood draws for you to take a look a little bit closer to this low blood count that we talked about.  I said it's probably from the radiation um.  Sometimes it will cause an anemia but I'd like to work it up and make sure that we don't have a problem with iron, B12 or folate. Three common nutritional deficiencies can cause anemia and low blood counts okay.  Do you have any other questions for me?

PATIENT S457
No I think that's about all.  What do I do with this recorder?

DOCTOR S457
I'm not sure, go ahead and take it outside okay.

PATIENT S457
Alright.

DOCTOR S457
When you check out okay.

PATIENT S457
Okay.

DOCTOR S457
Alright.  Alright so a couple more blood tests and then that one refill.  Everything else is going to stay the same.  You could start taking the magnesium from Walgreens.  Keep getting the aspirin from Walgreens okay and then the one pill that we'll provide for you through the VA okay.

PATIENT S457
Okay.

DOCTOR S457
Sound good?

PATIENT S457
Yeah.

DOCTOR S457
Sign these orders and we'll get you home okay.  Alright.  @@@.  Very nice to meet you @@@.

PATIENT S457
It was very nice to meet you and to see you again.

DOCTOR S457
Okay there you go this one's for you.  Then out and around to the left.  Take care.

PATIENT S457
Okay now.
