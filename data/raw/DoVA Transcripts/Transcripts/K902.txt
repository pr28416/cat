DOCTOR K902
Have you seen the urologist in the past?

PATIENT K902

PATIENT K902
You know what I was being @@@ you know I had what you call a @@@ hernia operation at age 17.

DOCTOR K902
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K902
I was martial artist and a boxer so I got hit in the stomach a lot.  I think it's unusual how long they hang in the scrotum sack.  That's what I think, but other than that I don't know.  I @@@ a lot, uh I lift weights you know and all that, everything like that to keep @@@.  I don't know why this happens, it happens like every two years or something.

DOCTOR K902
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K902
I'm just glad they didn't swell up this time.  @@@ a long time @@@.

DOCTOR K902
So also, back to your cough and you're coughing.  Do you think it's something more on the back of your throat or is it coming from your lungs?

PATIENT K902
My lungs.  It's like a nasal drip that goes down and in the morning time I had to cough it all up you know.  

DOCTOR K902
Okay and did you, were you supposed to follow up with the urologist?

PATIENT K902

DOCTOR K902
What's going on?

PATIENT K902
Oh my God, when it rains it hurts like crazy, swells up and the napropean, they gave me naproprian.

DOCTOR K902
Naproxen?

PATIENT K902
Yeah, yeah that, it does ease the pain so I had a couple of those I had left.  I don't have no more now, um I think it might need to be scraped like the other one was, it really hurts, it continues to pop a lot.  It just swells up I mean.

DOCTOR K902
@@@.

PATIENT K902
Yes they gave @@@ it works great, this one right here @@@.  Well it's the same thing as this one.

DOCTOR K902
@@@.

PATIENT K902
Yes, yes ma'am so but I stopped taking that like uh two weeks ago when my tongue first started to get dry.  Now it's gone from dry to extreme dry you know and I stopped taking everything all except four pills.  @@@ super dry.

DOCTOR K902

PATIENT K902
No.

DOCTOR K902
Okay, okay.  Alright you can sit up.  I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT K902

DOCTOR K902

DOCTOR K902
Alright.  I'm gonna talk to DOCTOR.

(DOCTOR OUT:  27:35  DOCTOR IN:  37:57)

DOCTOR K902
Okay, we'll do a couple of things.  We're going to start you on a new medication.

PATIENT K902
What?

DOCTOR K902
For your blood pressure and to help your heart rate too.  Um and we looked to try to see what could be causing this dry mouth and we think that the most likely cause is probably the loratadine medication.

PATIENT K902
For my sinus?

DOCTOR K902
Yeah.

PATIENT K902
I think so too, I was gonna say can we change it back to Sudafed or Claritin.  I think @@@.

DOCTOR K902
Well let's try you off of, cause those medications do that so let's try you off of it and see how you do.

PATIENT K902
And then I'm gonna be stopped up all night.

DOCTOR K902
We'll see though cause I mean if it's causing you this much pain, or this much you know trouble.

PATIENT K902
@@@.

DOCTOR K902
Let's just hold off on the medication right now.

PATIENT K902
Alright.

DOCTOR K902
Okay.  Um so that's one thing.  So this new medication I'm starting is called metoprolol.

PATIENT K902
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K902
Okay and it's for your blood pressure and for your heart rate okay.  And the other thing is I'm gonna treat you like you have an infection down there um and give you ciprofloxacin, that’s what you got the last time.  

PATIENT K902
What is that, an antibiotic?

DOCTOR K902
An antibiotic.

PATIENT K902
Alright um it was like a @@@ before that you know @@@.

DOCTOR K902
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K902
I want to know if that's normal cause I don't think that's normal.

DOCTOR K902
Okay um it feels like it's inflamed.

PATIENT K902
Oh that just don't feel normal.

DOCTOR K902
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K902
I ain't never @@@.

DOCTOR K902
Sure.

PATIENT K902
I just wanted the doctors to see.  I don't think that's normal.

DOCTOR K902
Okay.  Do you want DOCTOR to come in?

PATIENT K902
No, no @@@ but you know ain't got a pair so you don't know what's.

DOCTOR K902
Sure I can have him come take a look just to make sure, would you feel more comfortable with that?

PATIENT K902
No.

DOCTOR K902
I'm not; if you want me to I can have him see you.

PATIENT K902
Well yeah, alright, thank you.  It hurts.

(DOCTOR OUT:  40:03  DOCTOR IN:  40:20)

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Hey.

PATIENT K902
Hey DOCTOR how you doing?

SECOND DOCTOR K902
What's going on?

PATIENT K902
I was @@@.  The swelling is actually gone but I just worry here, maybe when you go holding that.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
I've got the magic touch?

PATIENT K902
Yeah, yeah, see if it's normal cause I don't think it’s normal doc.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Oh well I don't think anybody here has called it normal.

PATIENT K902
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
We think you've got epididymitis and we're gonna treat you with an antibiotic.

PATIENT K902
What is that?

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Epididymitis just means an infection where part of the scrotum is.

PATIENT K902
And this happens almost every two years like clockwork.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Yeah, yeah.  Well, we’ll calm this down down, you know we could possibly have you seen by the prostate and the penis and the epididymis specialists.

PATIENT K902
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
To see if there's anything we can do to prevent it from occurring again but.

PATIENT K902
But man it hurts, especially when I sit.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
And I get it.

PATIENT K902
Its back up @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
And you're talking about?

PATIENT K902
I'm talking about this one.  It's like a @@@ in there.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K902
And it don't feel like it's supposed to be in there doc.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Let me know if I'm really hurting you, if I'm really hurting you.

PATIENT K902
Uh.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Right up there?

PATIENT K902
Um no.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
It just right there.

PATIENT K902
You feel that @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
All that anatomically it's all correct.

PATIENT K902
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
But you actually have the pain exactly where you have the inflammation in the epididymis.

PATIENT K902
Oh really.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
That's like a kind of string area that runs up right above your testicle.

PATIENT K902
I knew when I was here I had four balls, I mean four testicles.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
You had four testicles?  Good God.

PATIENT K902
And nobody believed me.  My mother thought I, how do you explain @@@ watching you.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Yes.

PATIENT K902
Weight lifts and one time @@@ two balls and dropped two testicles, you actually have four testicles, did you know that?

SECOND DOCTOR K902
I didn't know that.

PATIENT K902
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
I think I would.

PATIENT K902
You got two up here and they would drop down so they cut me from here to here.  I don't know if they took it out or I was 17years old, but I was originally given four and as I get older I got more problems with my scrotum sac.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Yeah.

PATIENT K902
And is they supposed to hang that low?

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Yeah, that's normal.

PATIENT K902
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Yeah so we'll get you treated for that okay.

PATIENT K902
Okay.  So you say you got a guy that specializes in that?

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR K902
You saw him last time.

PATIENT K902
Oh yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR K902
So we're giving you basically the same treatment.

PATIENT K902
Okay, so this is to dry it up or?

SECOND DOCTOR K902
Yeah, @@@ uh it's like if you want to get some relief you could elevate them you know if you're sitting down you put a towel up under there, that'll give you some relief.  It'll take probably three, four days for the antibiotics to fully kick in.

PATIENT K902
I don't know, we'll see.

FIRST DOCTOR K902
