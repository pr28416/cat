DOCTOR T606
Okay, I'll do that.  Have you been using the gum?

PATIENT T606
Well I quit for a week, just recently.  I wasn't using it cause I have some stress you know.

DOCTOR T606
Yeah sure.

PATIENT T606
In my personal life, so just, argh, uh but uh I quit uh for a week and then, a little over a week ago but right now I'm at the point where I've started back up but I'm cutting it down, I want to quit again, so.  Again, but they say it takes sometimes, it takes three times.

DOCTOR T606
I understand that yeah.

PATIENT T606
Oh I been smoking for 47 years.

DOCTOR T606
It's a bad habit.

PATIENT T606
Yeah.  Yeah. It’s real hard.  But I go to church all the time now.  I'm a born again Christian and I'm praying and everything.  I think I'm gonna make it hopefully.

DOCTOR T606
Let's see um.  I think I went up on your cholesterol medicine.

PATIENT T606
Uh I was gonna, I quit taking it.

DOCTOR T606
Oh why?

PATIENT T606
It seems like I was getting pains and uh the doctor uh, what's her name uh the chief doctor, what's her name?

DOCTOR T606
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T606
She changed the medication because I was feeling pain from the other one.

DOCTOR T606
Let's see which doctor?

PATIENT T606
What's her name right here?

DOCTOR T606
DOCTOR?

PATIENT T606
Yeah.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.  Let me see if she wrote a note on that.  She changed it to pravastatin okay.  @@@.

PATIENT T606
I was getting pains again.  I've been pain a lot in the right shoulder.  I get pain in my shoulder.  @@@ get a cortisone shot every three months.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
And uh it seem like it just made it worse, you know.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
So I quit and the shoulder felt a little better.

DOCTOR T606
So is the pain in your shoulder or pain in the muscles?

PATIENT T606
It's hard to tell the difference.  @@@.

DOCTOR T606
Did you have pain anywhere else?

PATIENT T606
No. The shoulder and right in this area. Seems like It was in the muscle too and uh I quit taking it.  I'm overdue for my steroid shot but their backlogged up there so what I was -  you know, doing myself was that I got an appointment for up there but it's late cause they're stacked up.  I wanted to get my shot once again and then start taking that medication again and see if there is a difference because it was like I couldn’t move my arm hardly.  I still have problems but @@@.

DOCTOR T606
Is it a sharp pain when you move your arm?

PATIENT T606
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR T606
And if you're not moving it, how is it, is it better?

PATIENT T606
I'm okay right now but if I move it.

DOCTOR T606
It's, I mean keep going.

PATIENT T606
You can hear it snap at times.

DOCTOR T606
When you were on the medicine for your cholesterol was it bad when you were moving?

PATIENT T606
It was bad when I wasn't moving nowhere.  If I remember correctly.  I got so many things in my mind that I try to remember.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
I don't like @@@.

DOCTOR T606
No, no I understand, no that's fine.  Um.  Do you know when you have an appointment for that?

PATIENT T606
Uh next month, I'm not sure exactly of the date.  I've got it at home but I got it next month.

DOCTOR T606
Cause I think.

PATIENT T606
Probably within the month.

DOCTOR T606
Yeah.  The way you talk, it makes me think its degenerative change problems, @@@ I’m trying to @@@.

PATIENT T606
I'm gonna give @@@ more.

DOCTOR T606
Okay, @@@ what the ultimate problem is.  Because you know how well, you know shoulder joints work for a while oh I mean injections work but they're temporary measures.  They don't uh.

PATIENT T606
Well I just, I just, you can hear it popping.

DOCTOR T606
Oh I know.

PATIENT T606
And I'm just wondering if maybe my shoulder is uh.

DOCTOR T606
Have you done physical therapy?

PATIENT T606
I like the physical therapy for a while but not actually for my shoulder for my back I mean.

DOCTOR T606
But let's see.

PATIENT T606
@@@.

DOCTOR T606
Oh because what I'm saying a lot of times one of the best ways of getting things better is working on things around that joint.

PATIENT T606
Oh.

DOCTOR T606
Getting the muscle either more loose and strengthens around the joint.

PATIENT T606
Oh.

DOCTOR T606
That not only helps the joint but it helps to support the structures.

PATIENT T606
Yeah.

DOCTOR T606
And a lot of times you'll see improvement that way.

PATIENT T606
Oh.

DOCTOR T606
@@@.

PATIENT T606
I was at physical therapy.

DOCTOR T606
Good.  Way back in 2010 right, was that when it was 2010?

PATIENT T606
I can't remember.  Sometimes I @@@.

DOCTOR T606
Have you @@@ rotator cuff?

PATIENT T606
No but I.

DOCTOR T606
Ever have an MRI for your shoulder?

PATIENT T606
No.  I just had an MRI on my brain you know.

DOCTOR T606
Yeah let me make sure.

PATIENT T606
Which was cool.  @@@

PATIENT T606
Oh I was looking at your x-rays; you've got a bony spur in there.

PATIENT T606
I think I got to discuss this with them a little bit further this time.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
Because you know I think I tore my rotator cuff a long time ago and uh I don't know what's wrong with it now.  Just like came on all of a sudden and it snaps and pops.  I sometimes, I have a feeling; I got to ask them, if it's dislocated or something.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.  Yeah it's probably not dislocated.  You'd really know it if it was dislocated.

PATIENT T606
Oh I'm telling you at times I really feel it.

DOCTOR T606
Where, we'll take a look.  I mean it would look like this.  You’d look in the mirror and see that you don’t look symmetrical.

PATIENT T606
Oh okay.  Alright.

DOCTOR T606
That's @@@ obvious.

PATIENT T606
Okay, okay.  Then it ain’t dislocated but sometimes I get a real bad pain and if I move it suddenly I get a sharp pain like ah.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
Like I said I'm gonna talk to them more.  I guess that's what they specialize in so.

DOCTOR T606
Yeah they do that all the time.

PATIENT T606
@@@.

DOCTOR T606
Let's see, @@@.  They weren't gonna to do a colonoscopy for you but it looks like we're gonna do maybe the blood tests for your stool.

PATIENT T606
Right, you know what.

DOCTOR T606
Did you pick those up, or, it looks like it.

PATIENT T606
Well I did pick them up.

DOCTOR T606
Okay so you did get them.

PATIENT T606
But I misplaced it. I lost it.  

DOCTOR T606
Yeah we'll @@@.

PATIENT T606
Oh okay.  Yeah I was gonna ask you about that. @@@.  And I wanted to ask uh.

DOCTOR T606
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T606
Uh DOCTOR sent me for an x-ray on my spine. I wondered because  in order to get service-connected disability with my back.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
And uh I don't know if it's the muscles or the disability.  Sometimes I see these doctors and then I forgot what they said.  All I know is this spot is something like that.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
But uh.  I was at Mercy Hospital before I started coming to the VA.  I think I had one of the spine and I got arthritis or some kind of thing @@@.

DOCTOR T606
Let's see, I see.  Wait a second.  All I see is um a CT of, essentially right here from November 2010.  Did you get anything; you got something done somewhere else?

PATIENT T606
Uh no, nowhere else.
s
DOCTOR T606
Okay.  Well we have some @@@ six months ago.  They did a CT of your neck and it showed some degenerative changes.

PATIENT T606
When was the last time I was here, do you know?

DOCTOR T606
Okay December.

PATIENT T606
Uh well I had that done since the last time I was here.

DOCTOR T606
@@@ imaging done. Where?

PATIENT T606
Here.

DOCTOR T606
Um, you did, did you do an MRI?

PATIENT T606
Uh I did that at Hines.

DOCTOR T606
Well let me actually see.

PATIENT T606
But now I didn't have the spine x-ray at Hines, I believe that was here.

DOCTOR T606
Okay. So let's see.  

PATIENT T606
It's @@@ brain @@@.

DOCTOR T606
Here we go. There you go, wait, what?  They did an MRI of your brain?

PATIENT T606
I had uh yes.

DOCTOR T606
What was the ultimate reason for?

PATIENT T606
Well it started out uh a while back, I think two doctors ago.  Some guy thought I might have been having a heart attack cause my left eye went numb.  Instead they sent me, they checked me out and no heart attack but they sent me for a CAT scan and uh but that's gone, I don't know I guess it came out okay.

DOCTOR T606
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T606
And she wanted to send me, she thought that maybe I might have had a stroke, or whatever, so she scheduled me for an MRI, I couldn't do it because I'm claustrophobic. I tried.  They outsourced me even and they @@@ and this time they gave me some medication and I went to Hines and I did it and everything was alright except they said that I got an enlarged blood vessel but it's not a, oh what do you call uh, uh.

DOCTOR T606
Not like an aneurysm.

PATIENT T606
Right they said it wasn't an aneurysm.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
And she said uh that my sinuses, I got an infection in my sinuses.  

DOCTOR T606
@@@ can also see.

PATIENT T606
So.  And I was just happy it wasn't a stroke or whatever.  But she didn't say about the medication.  I only took two pills and the nasal spray.

DOCTOR T606
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T606
I take them it seems like my nose just keeps running and running and running.

DOCTOR T606
Yeah.

PATIENT T606
So I stopped that too and my nose doesn't run and uh.  When I joined the service uh they said I had postnasal drip that could kill a horse. Their exact words.  But it runs in my family.

DOCTOR T606
Okay.  Yeah I'll be honest with you, there are a couple of things which really help that, might make a difference @@@.  

PATIENT T606
Yeah.  @@@ smoking.

DOCTOR T606
@@@ smoking @@@ huge @@@.  To be honest with you uh it really is.

PATIENT T606

PATIENT T606

DOCTOR T606

DOCTOR T606

PATIENT T606
I stopped taking it and I got an appointment like at the beginning of next month.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
I'm seeing them again.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
You're seeing them again okay.

PATIENT T606
But uh yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
You know it's hard and you have a lot of risk factors.  You know sometimes I have patients come and say yeah you now you're really sick and I really think that's alright for you to @@@ and then they come back a couple months later with a heart attack so I don't want you to.

PATIENT T606
Oh and you're gonna give me a heart attack now.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Yeah.  @@@ sometimes we try to go along, but you know you have a lot of things going against you.  The smoking.

PATIENT T606
Yeah I understand but at the time I'd be in such pain you know.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Yeah.

PATIENT T606
You told me that.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
I mean I don't want you to take your medicines, I just want to make sure is that really the problem though.

PATIENT T606
Well I'm that's what I want to determine.  I'm waiting to get in up there again and get a shot.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T606
And then I was gonna start taking that again and see.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
How, what happens.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
You know then if you want to restart it, you could restart it again.

PATIENT T606
No not now.  Not till after I have that shot.  I'm telling you.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Okay, okay.

PATIENT T606
It's very painful.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
I mean I understand the risks I'm taking.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
But uh if it comes down to you know.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Well right now you have a lot of pain uh is it only when you do certain things?

PATIENT T606
When I do certain things.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Okay when you take the pills, even at rest you're in pain is that correct?

PATIENT T606
Uh most of the time it seems yes.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Yeah okay.

PATIENT T606
But I'm going to find out myself.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
Cause I'm going to see that doctor again.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT T606
And I'm going to get a shot, hopefully I guess.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
I'm gonna talk to him and after that I will resume taking that.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Okay.

PATIENT T606
Cause I may have to find out for myself.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Yeah okay.  Um there's a couple of other statins that if that is the problem we can try another statin.  @@@ problems with all of them unfortunately.

PATIENT T606
Oh.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Um and now we, have you decided about it, you remember that we.

PATIENT T606
Yeah we were going to discuss that, do you remember, we haven't discussed that.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Well I filled in the form they said.

PATIENT T606
I know and I told you we'll talk about that next time I come in.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Yeah that's why I'm here to talk to you.

PATIENT T606
Yeah okay, we're talking.  What is it?

SECOND DOCTOR T606
So this is one of the veins seemed a little bit enlarged in the head um one of the veins.  Now we all have um.

PATIENT T606
Right, right, right.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Sinuses.

PATIENT T606
Now what is this thing called?

SECOND DOCTOR T606
It’s like an MRI.  It's called MRE, which is the same thing as having @@@ inject you with the die.

PATIENT T606
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
It's a different kind of picture exactly.

PATIENT T606
It's the same thing basically as a MRI.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
MRI.

PATIENT T606
Wonderful.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Can you go @@@?

PATIENT T606
What if I don't I mean, what's the?

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Well um the thing is um you know we just want to make sure it's not like an aneurysm.  Oh @@@ um.

PATIENT T606
I thought you said it wasn't.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
It's not an aneurysm because it's not coming from the artery @@@.

PATIENT T606
Well it already showed that it's enlarged.  I mean what difference does it make of having it done or not?  MRE or V or whatever it is.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Uh no @@@.  Um.

PATIENT T606
It just seems like I've been getting a whole lot of x-rays and stuff you know.  I shut out the light here and we can still see you know.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
No, no.

PATIENT T606
Cause I glow in the dark.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
The thing is sometimes the @@@ get thrombosed, you know they can @@@ you know they get enlarged and they're bigger than usual and then blood tends to thicken there and they can form clots and then you end up with a different set of problems and @@@ end up being on blood thinners long-term.

PATIENT T606
Okay and uh.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
And uh it could potentially cause a stroke because.

PATIENT T606
Okay, what if I get the MRE and what is it going to show different?

SECOND DOCTOR T606
So if it does show that you have uh a enlarged vein.

PATIENT T606
Okay then what do you do?

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Unless you have thrombosis, more blood clots, we leave it alone and then @@@ blood clot then you have to be on blood thinners.

PATIENT T606
Oh boy.  It seems like I get a lot of x-rays and stuff.  They all don’t seem necessary.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
You know the problem is unfortunately @@@ right now, @@@ we have to follow up on it because now there is something @@@.

PATIENT T606
@@@.  One test uh, I just tested for that one thing.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
And they found something else.

PATIENT T606
And the test shows up something different and then when it shows up something different I get a test for that and that shows up something different.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
@@@.

PATIENT T606
And it's going on and on and on.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
I know.  It's because @@@ so intense, @@@.

PATIENT T606
When do we finally say okay that's enough?

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Uh we yeah the patient dies or when he says no I don't want it @@@ because from our side of view we had to offer it and.

PATIENT T606
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR T606
Just so we can get some answers.  So.

PATIENT T606
Where do I have this at?  Hines again?

SECOND DOCTOR T606
At Hines again.

PATIENT T606
And it's the same thing huh?

SECOND DOCTOR T606
They do the same thing.  They just to a focus on the veins this time, not on the.
