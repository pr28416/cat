Um well I know I’m in pain because you cut me down on my medication.  You what I'm saying you gonna cut back.  You know get off that TB stuff.  That's what's probably messing with my liver.  But ain't never had no problem with it until I started taking that.

DOCTOR Z166
No, you don’t have problems with your liver.

PATIENT Z166
For the kidney, whatever.  I wouldn't had no problem I would keep on my medications.

DOCTOR Z166
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z166
Until I started taking that what @@@ she told me that it mixed with my @@@ and stuff.

DOCTOR Z166
That medication you're taking doesn’t affect the kidneys and we're monitoring your liver.

PATIENT Z166
Right.

DOCTOR Z166
And your liver is doing okay so far.

PATIENT Z166
Okay.

DOCTOR Z166
And you're not gonna take it for the rest of your life, it's only for nine months and you're almost half, @@@.

PATIENT Z166
Hope, hope.

DOCTOR Z166
So you have another four or five.

PATIENT Z166
Right.

DOCTOR Z166
You're done after that.  You don't take that, so we @@@ risk of tuberculosis.  Uh that's one thing.  The other thing is I, you're in pain.

PATIENT Z166

PATIENT Z166
@@@ they will.

DOCTOR Z166
Well I mean if, if I give five pounds of pain medication, of course you're gonna do it.

PATIENT Z166
But it's alright.

DOCTOR Z166
But that's not the answer because it kills all the other organs in your body but um I'm don’t remember, have you ever been seen in the Pain Clinic?

DOCTOR Z166
Okay.  That was the other question but let you go first to the Pain Clinic for anything.

PATIENT Z166
Right.

DOCTOR Z166
Because sometimes, not in all the joints but the joints that hurt the most they can uh inject steroids that will take the pain away for months.

PATIENT Z166
@@@ too @@@ I’m a diabetic and they didn’t want to. @@@

DOCTOR Z166

PATIENT Z166
Here.

DOCTOR Z166
Here in General Medicine.

PATIENT Z166
Right, right.  @@@.

DOCTOR Z166
The steroids would increase the sugars yes.  The problem is that we can deal with the sugars with medications as long as it takes care of the pain okay.  Now is this the first time you going to go to Rheumatology?

PATIENT Z166
Yeah, yeah.  @@@ wouldn’t see me @@@.

DOCTOR Z166

DOCTOR Z166
The Rheumatology doctors are the joint doctors.

PATIENT Z166
Right, right.

DOCTOR Z166
Okay.

PATIENT Z166
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z166
They got some new kinds of medications for this type of pain.

PATIENT Z166
Okay.

DOCTOR Z166
Okay.  It's not; it's medications that really have turned life around for a lot of people.

PATIENT Z166
Okay.

DOCTOR Z166
What these medications do though, you cannot take them if you are at risk of tuberculosis.  One, well let me finish.

PATIENT Z166
Okay.

DOCTOR Z166
Once you are treated for tuberculosis then we can see that it's alright, now we can do this medication.

DOCTOR Z166

PATIENT Z166

DOCTOR Z166

PATIENT Z166
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z166
Alcohol is not the answer.

PATIENT Z166
No.  I don't know, maybe I can try @@@.

DOCTOR Z166
@@@.

PATIENT Z166
I know that it is.  It is getting where it could.  The pain is like being temporary and @@@ drink some more and after that, drink some more.

DOCTOR Z166
But for you to get the best care that we can possibly give you.

PATIENT Z166
Okay.

DOCTOR Z166
Okay.  Rheumatology doctors, as I said, are the joint specialists.

PATIENT Z166

DOCTOR Z166
With regard to the pain.

PATIENT Z166
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z166
Uh have all these new kinds of fancy medications and injections as well that they can do injections um and that's all they do.  They don't deal with anything else.  They're great at what they do.

DOCTOR Z166
@@@ decreased it @@@.

PATIENT Z166

DOCTOR Z166
You know people are in joint pain that they can live with that.  People cannot live without liver.

PATIENT Z166
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z166
They cannot live without kidneys.

PATIENT Z166
Right.

DOCTOR Z166

DOCTOR Z166
Hydrocordone and acetaminophen.

PATIENT Z166

DOCTOR Z166
The tuberculosis drug is isoniazid.

PATIENT Z166
Yeah that don't mess with the liver?

DOCTOR Z166

DOCTOR Z166
I understand it.  The Naproxen can damage your kidneys and your stomach.  Uh hydrocodone and acetaminophen that's what you take damages your liver uh and you take a lot.  If we came down to only one pill take care of all this joint pain can you imagine how much medications less you're going to take and how happy you're gonna be, so hang in there.

PATIENT Z166
Okay yeah they mailed the cream.

DOCTOR Z166

DOCTOR Z166
Oh @@@

PATIENT Z166
Right.

DOCTOR Z166
Um let's see @@@.  Okay yeah um.  I'm looking at long term.  I'm looking how to get you better.  You’re a young man, if I can get your tuberculosis treated.

PATIENT Z166
And my @@@ look good.  @@@ surgery @@@.  It's just messed up, it just messed up with me, it just came in up again, like it hanging up.

DOCTOR Z166
All your joints.  It's not one joint, if it was only one joint it's.

PATIENT Z166
Right, right.  This one's like, that knee and if it swells up, that's my elbow right here.

DOCTOR Z166
So what you need to do is just @@@.

PATIENT Z166
That's what I did.

DOCTOR Z166
That @@@ fix all the joints, take the pain away from the joints.  So if I can treat your tuberculosis, if the Rheumatology doctors can help you find the perfect pill for you and when you take the pill from the rheumatologist will make the pain much better you'll be taking so much less medication, be more active.  By being more active you'll move more, hopefully lose some weight.

PATIENT Z166
I'm losing weight, I lost some.

DOCTOR Z166
Hold up. By losing more weight you won't need to use the mask don't you see?

PATIENT Z166
That's what cause it?

DOCTOR Z166
Yeah obesity.  That's the number one cause.  @@@ So that's the number one cause.  So @@@ what I'm saying is the answer to the problem is not add another pill, add another @@@.

PATIENT Z166
No.

DOCTOR Z166
@@@.

PATIENT Z166
@@@ I'm trying to find the answer too @@@, genetic-wise what I got that.  I knew what genetic wise.  @@@ genetic wise but I didn’t think I’d be hurting like this.

DOCTOR Z166
That's why, and the fact that there are a lot of people in your family have similar problems and it can be a genetic thing, something that's passed down.

PATIENT Z166
Right that's what I'm saying.  I know @@@ this.  If you know they could do a blood test like that.

DOCTOR Z166
Uh-huh.  Uh most often no but yet let me see if Rheumatology has done any, just double check and then if not I can always.  Whether they have done it or not I can I'll do some blood work today or next time you come here.

PATIENT Z166
Yeah I'll do it next week.  I'll be up next week and I'll get it.

DOCTOR Z166
Okay I'll put it for Monday and come you can do it anytime next week.

PATIENT Z166
Okay.

DOCTOR Z166
Uh but do it before you see Rheumatology.

PATIENT Z166

DOCTOR Z166
15th.

PATIENT Z166

DOCTOR Z166
Yep, yeah um gout.

PATIENT Z166
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z166
Yeah we have gout that would give pain uh.  I would give you pain in some joints but not all over the body.  Um that's, so I'll put them for next Monday but um.

PATIENT Z166
So even if they give me shots in my arms that still wasn't to give me that limitation I feel in them.  I'm really losing patience and motion.

DOCTOR Z166
Motion, yeah.  We'll try to get some of it back.

PATIENT Z166

DOCTOR Z166

PATIENT Z166
