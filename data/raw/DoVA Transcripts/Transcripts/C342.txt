I'll talk the DOCTOR to see if there's something else we can do but maybe your psychiatrist would be better filling out some of this stuff.

Let me take a listen to you.  Deep breath.  Do you smoke?

Yep.

About a pack a day.

DOCTOR C342
Pack a day.  Any thoughts of quitting?

PATIENT C342
No.

DOCTOR C342
Why not?

I kind of like smoking.

DOCTOR C342
You know it's harmful for you right?

PATIENT C342
Well I believe it's harmful for some and not harmful to others.

DOCTOR C342
It's harmful to everybody.

PATIENT C342
Oh.

DOCTOR C342
It'll, you don't feel anything and then all of a sudden it's, it gets to the point where your lungs are too affected and you can't get in any oxygen.  People end up on oxygen at home, end up on breathing machines because they can't breathe cause their lungs don't function as well.  It causes a lot of problems.  It causes heart problems.  People that smoke tend to have heart attacks a lot earlier than people that don't smoke um so and it is a lot of money, it's getting more expensive so.  That's what I want you to do for the next time I see you.  I want you to think about quitting.

PATIENT C342
Or I'll cut back quite a bit maybe.

DOCTOR C342
Okay.  I mean I can't say no to that but my goal is to get you to quit okay.
