DOCTOR Z459

SECOND PERSON Z459
Uh chest pain.  Uh he had an epidural on Friday and because we were here they told us to come in after he was done.

SECONDD PERSON Z459
And of course because he had twighlight um his blood pressure was fine when he was here.

SECONDD PERSON Z459.
He didn't have increased respirations but um I had him taking nitro.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Which he's not prone to do because it gives him such a headache.  Um but uh this is something that's been going on for a while.

DOCTOR Z459
So all of a sudden your blood pressure goes up and then you have chest pain?

SECOND PERSON Z459
No it's been going up uh on a regular basis.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Um.  Spoke to her.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Um couple of times, uh she said well we'll do a follow-up appointment, that's not until March 16th.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Things got worse, I gave her a call um, faxed her the test results and she said um she could talk to the attending and get back to me and I never heard anything.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
So then I spoke to NAME several times trying to get down to the bottom of it because um quite frankly, well Friday night on a scale of 1-10, uh he probably was at a 20.

DOCTOR Z459
In pain?

SECOND PERSON Z459
In pain.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Uh, continuing over the weekend, his blood pressure was elevated.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Pulse anywhere from 90 to 102.

DOCTOR Z459
And the whole time you're having chest pains?

PATIENT Z459
Yeah I have, actually dear I'm having chest pains right now.

DOCTOR Z459
Right now you're having chest pain?

PATIENT Z459
Yeah.  They don't, they elevated.  They come but they don't ever completely go away.  They've been that way for a while now.

DOCTOR Z459
And on a scale of 1-10 how bad is the chest pain?

PATIENT Z459
Right now, probably a 5.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
And that's about the lowest that they go.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.  Okay and how long has, you said this is gradually getting worse.  How long has this been happening?

PATIENT Z459
Probably the better part of a good month, maybe a little longer.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
I see DOCTOR in the fall.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah and he gave.

PATIENT Z459
And my blood pressure was starting to give me problems then.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
And she decided to add another blood pressure pill to the regimen I was already on.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
So I take like 20 mg at night when I go to bed.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
But regardless taking it in the morning or taking it at night together, uh it's like all weekend long my blood pressure was systolic wise it was in the 150s, low 160s.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah, so since then it's just been going up?

PATIENT Z459
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.  So what are you on, let's see you're on diltiazem, why are you on diltiazem?  Is that just for blood pressure?

PATIENT Z459
No my heart.

DOCTOR Z459
But why?

PATIENT Z459
I have a bad valve.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
And he has coronary artery spasms.

DOCTOR Z459
So how did they diagnosis the coronary artery spasm?

SECOND PERSON Z459
Angio.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay and they saw that.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Right at the time it was happening.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Cause he's had heart attacks in the past but they could never find anything.

PATIENT Z459
Because they never could catch it when it was going on at the exact time.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay and then they did a cath and it was negative and that was in 2009.

PATIENT Z459
No in 2009 they did a cath.

DOCTOR Z459
Yes.

PATIENT Z459
And it was.

DOCTOR Z459
They saw spasms.

PATIENT Z459
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z459
They finally saw it.  He had had prior heart attacks.

DOCTOR Z459
Oh.

SECOND PERSON Z459
But nobody ever saw anything.

DOCTOR Z459
Oh and finally.

PATIENT Z459
Yeah DOCTOR found it, that was down at Holy Cross Hospital.

DOCTOR Z459
Oh.

PATIENT Z459
At Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Yeah when NAME took my blood pressure, we got here, what was it again NAME?

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah it was 148/102.

PATIENT Z459
And she took it just before we left the house to come here and it was 161/102.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.  Well yeah, you're not, it's not really been under control hmm.  Okay, well a couple of things.  When was the last time you had an EKG and a lot of other things for you?  And if you're having active chest pain.

PATIENT Z459
I mean when I had the epidural on Friday.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
They hooked, because of my heart the way it is, they didn't want to take any precautions so they made me have the epidural in the OR.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Basically he's had no testing.  

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
She did say to me when was his last stress test?

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z459
I said it was probably at least 2 1/2 years ago.
PATIENT Z459
It would have been in November of 09.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z459
So then okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
And again she was going to talk to the attending and get back to me and I have never heard.

PATIENT Z459
But we never heard from her.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah what testing have you gotten so far?  You said that you had.

PATIENT Z459
DOCTOR when I first started coming into the VA.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
Now you said that you faxed something to us, what did you fax to us?

SECOND PERSON Z459
I faxed um.

PATIENT Z459
I bet it's not in the computer.

DOCTOR Z459
No, it wouldnâ€™t be.

SECOND PERSON Z459
An EKG, an echocardiogram report um.

PATIENT Z459
You brought it with you didn't you?

SECOND PERSON Z459
Yeah.

PATIENT Z459
Yeah that's what I thought.

DOCTOR Z459
May I take a look at those?

PATIENT Z459
Those were just done in January.

DOCTOR Z459
Now this chest pain is it worse when you're walking around or do you just notice it worse when your blood pressure is higher.  Is it chest pain and where is it?  Is it on the left side; is it on the right side?

PATIENT Z459
It moves.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
So like right now it's bothering me like right in here.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
Sometimes it's in here.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
Sometimes it's in here and goes down my arm.

DOCTOR Z459
Oh okay.  And is it worse with the blood pressure, you notice if the blood pressure is high that's when your chest pain is worse?

PATIENT Z459
If I'm just sitting down totally relaxed, we'll say watching television or reading a book.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
I could still be sitting here having chest pain.  I get up and move around, especially here of late maybe the last week, 10 days, all of a sudden I'll find myself getting short of breath.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
And then the pain elevates so I'm sure if I go back and take my blood pressure or have NAME take it.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah, it would be high.

PATIENT Z459
Uh.

DOCTOR Z459
So you think it's associated with your blood pressure.

PATIENT Z459
Oh I don't think there's any way around it.  I, but like I was saying when I had the epidural on Friday morning.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
And they had me all hooked up, I don't know if that's actually the case, but they were watching my heart.

DOCTOR Z459
Well yeah but that's not an EKG.

PATIENT Z459
So what they didn't see anything per se or they wouldn't of did the epidural.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
So.

DOCTOR Z459
And that was your blood pressure right, they just saw you in the clinic.

PATIENT Z459
Right.  Now I see DOCTOR this week as a matter of fact.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
Thursday.

DOCTOR Z459
So one of the things is your chronic low back pain is why they did the epidural.

PATIENT Z459
Correct.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Lower back pain.  He has a right rotator cuff.

DOCTOR Z459
Oh.  So what's wrong with your mitral valve?  Do you know?

PATIENT Z459
I got everything that DOCTOR ever did on my heart but I didn't bring all that in here.  It should be in the computer from DOCTOR.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
She had all my records at one time.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah and none of this, any of this, there's no echo or anything here.  This is all from different things.

SECOND PERSON Z459
There's an echo there.  It might be on the other side.

DOCTOR Z459
Oh I see.  They're all double-sided.

PATIENT Z459
Yeah see this number right here concerned me.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
So.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay here's your echo.  So where did you get all this stuff done?

SECOND PERSON Z459
Loyola.

DOCTOR Z459
Do you see a doctor at Loyola?

SECOND PERSON Z459
No it was uh basically to get a baseline for ourselves.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Cause he has a triple A.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
And because he has such severe back pain I kind of wanted some, I'm an RN.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON Z459
I kind of wanted to know when it was back pain and when we had to worry about triple A.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
So, DOCTOR you now.

PATIENT Z459
So basically what we did was.

SECOND PERSON Z459
To know the size of the aneurysm now.

DOCTOR Z459
So, okay, why did you have all this wasnâ€™t done here at the VA?

SECOND PERSON Z459
Good question.

PATIENT Z459
I tried to get DOCTOR to send me to a cardiologist last fall and she came back in and said they didn't.

SECOND PERSON Z459
She could take care of it herself.

PATIENT Z459
Yeah and they never sent me to him.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay so how did you get this?  Who did you see at Loyola?

SECOND PERSON Z459
This was just like a clinic where you pay for it.

DOCTOR Z459
Oh you can get all these like.

SECOND PERSON Z459
All these summations done, some yeah.

PATIENT Z459
Oh yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z459
We didn't get with DOCTOR you just have to pay for it.

DOCTOR Z459
I see.  Um so how long ago was all this?  Oh January 11th.

PATIENT Z459
Yeah, what a month ago.  A month and what two days.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z459
It would have been wonderful that they did something here but it's not from the lack of us asking for it.

DOCTOR Z459
The way they are reporting these things are kind of strange.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Yeah.

PATIENT Z459
Basically though that's more like a baseline to like bring to you or to a cardiologist.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.

PATIENT Z459
So that they have an idea because there's stuff in there that should have been followed up on so.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah and you have some diastolic dysfunction but that's kind of expected when you've had a history of heart disease and that kind of thing.

SECOND PERSON Z459
She made a comment about um, uh because of his triglyceride level.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON Z459
That she should change him off the simvastatin and put him on something else but she said again I needed to talk to the attending and then I never heard nothing.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.  I'm actually looking at your most recent lipids and you look okay.  They actually look more than fine.

PATIENT Z459
Those were a year ago.

DOCTOR Z459
February yeah.

PATIENT Z459
So it was a year ago, DOCTOR ordered all that blood work.  That was a year ago.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z459
There's a lipid panel in those papers.

PATIENT Z459
Yeah see I wouldn't, she was, what NAME told us on Friday when we came in.

DOCTOR Z459
Now this just says that, it doesn't give me the numbers it just said that your numbers were normal.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT Z459
Yeah I mean she said she was going to talk to DOCTOR Friday afternoon cause she wasn't here when we were here.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
And have her call us and.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Never called.

PATIENT Z459
Then again we never heard from her.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
So I.  NAME did get this appointment scheduled today.  Obviously we're in here seeing.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.

PATIENT Z459
To see you because it was the only thing she could find available.

DOCTOR Z459
It was the only thing open.

PATIENT Z459
Right.

SECOND PERSON Z459
And the EKG here says see doc soon for symptoms.

DOCTOR Z459
And the EKG.

SECOND PERSON Z459
They didn't really give us; they didn't really give us a report on the EKG itself.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah and you're triglycerides are a little high but actually we don't really treat triglycerides other than.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Thatâ€™s what she said yeah.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.  So they're not really, we wouldn't do anything about that.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Well she made @@@ about the simvastatin so.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.  Um let's see.  And then thereâ€™s this early @@@ change.

SECOND PERSON Z459
I mean that obviously we need to get the blood pressure more under control and we got that.

DOCTOR Z459
Right.  Well okay and right now you're saying you're having a 5 out of 10 chest pain?

PATIENT Z459
Uh-huh.  If I get up and start moving around very much it'll get worse.

DOCTOR Z459
It does.

PATIENT Z459
Oh yeah.  I guarantee you it will.

DOCTOR Z459
Is it similar to the coronary stabbing pain you had before?

PATIENT Z459
Um you mean as far as me actually having, like call 911 and have the ambulance come and get me?

DOCTOR Z459
Yes.

PATIENT Z459
Normally if it goes all the way out, I mean it looks, it feels, it's the worst pain you could ever imagine in your life.  It's like an elephant sat down on my chest.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
But normally it'll make me sick and then it's like I'll break out into, what, a hard sweat within seconds, maybe a minute, you'd think somebody poured a bucket of water on me.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
If I'm laying in bed the whole bed will be soaked.  If I'm sitting on the chair like this, there'll be a puddle underneath me.

DOCTOR Z459
Well what I would do is get a troponin and EKG.  If you're having active chest pain we have to look at that.  Um and then I would order a stress test and if you're really having chest pain with angina and you know sometimes we would consider sending people with these symptoms to Cardiology to get a cath.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay.

DOCTOR Z459
Um so let me talk with my attending.

PATIENT Z459
Yeah because see I don't know if DOCTOR showed him any of this stuff.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
Or her or what @@@.  I haven't because she never responded back to us again.

DOCTOR Z459
And maybe because, you know the residents aren't always here so I'm not sure what rotation she's on, you know a lot of these things um.

PATIENT Z459
I don't know what she said.

SECOND PERSON Z459
No I know she was there that afternoon, Friday afternoon and we left at 12:30 and she was just coming in so I know that she had that afternoon she could have called me and I had talked to her on Wednesday.  Thursday she was there.

DOCTOR Z459
Sure.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Um so I mean, I don't want to completely uh says she you know.

PATIENT Z459
It's more; again she didn't return any calls.

SECOND PERSON Z459
And DOCTOR had NAME call me and tell me we're not sure what to do yet.

DOCTOR Z459
Right.  Well have a seat here, let me just examine you.  I'm going to send to get another EKG for our records and I'm going to talk to my boss.

PATIENT Z459
You need me to take my shirt off here?

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah that would be helpful.  Either way when they do the EKG they'll probably need that.

PATIENT Z459
Oh they'll have me take it off, yeah sure.

DOCTOR Z459
But I don't know they may not do it in here though so, actually just keep it on, I'll lift it to examine and then they'll have you take it all the way off cause you may have to move to a different room so.  Deep breath.  You said about a month you've been noticing this right?

PATIENT Z459
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Sometime about a month, around there yeah.

DOCTOR Z459
Can I get you to lay back down here?  So it's worse with exertion and when your blood pressure is up?

PATIENT Z459
Yep.

DOCTOR Z459
And right now how's your back pain?

PATIENT Z459
Um I'm a little sore but I mean that's still from the epidural.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.  So no.

PATIENT Z459
I'm not in as much pain in my lower back.

DOCTOR Z459
No belly pain?  And point to your chest pain again?

PATIENT Z459
Right now?

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.

PATIENT Z459
It's right in here.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
It's right here.

DOCTOR Z459
Alright.  Does it hurt when I push down at all?  Any change to that pain?

PATIENT Z459
I can feel that, yeah.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.  Did it feel like the pain that you're having?

PATIENT Z459
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z459
It does?

PATIENT Z459
Yeah.  See like you hit right here I feel that.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
When you get down in here I feel that.

DOCTOR Z459
So that's the pain that you're feeling?

PATIENT Z459
Yes.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay so that actually makes me a lot less concerned.  When you have something, so what this is called is reproducible chest pain and when you have something reproducible chest pain it's a lot less concerning.  It makes me think it's more of a muscle spasm versus your heart.

PATIENT Z459
Ah, I disagree.

DOCTOR Z459
Well when I push down it hurts right?

PATIENT Z459
No not necessarily.  I feel it.

DOCTOR Z459
You feel it but it's not the same pain that you're feeling?

PATIENT Z459
No.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.  Cause you feel it here too right?

PATIENT Z459
Yes.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay but it's not the same pain that you'll have in your chest.

PATIENT Z459
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z459
He usually has it like right here.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON Z459
And then right upper gastric.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Oh left I'm sorry.

DOCTOR Z459
Left chest okay and its worse when you're running around, going upstairs and its worse with high blood pressure.  What about eating or laying down, does that change anything?

PATIENT Z459
Yeah, I mean.  I'm smart enough to know because I take something for stomach anyway.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah for GERD or something like that.  This is definitely not that.

PATIENT Z459
No, no.  Um it's not gastric.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
If that's what you're asking me.

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.

PATIENT Z459
So that's what, in the beginning that's what I thought.

DOCTOR Z459
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z459
That it was gastric pain because I was getting so much of it in here.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.

PATIENT Z459
But no and it's different.  I know I've had going back and forth in my stomach for years.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay.  Well let me, um come with me cause I want you to get an EKG and I'll talk to my boss.  DOCTOR will see you and he'll bring you back to my room when he's finished.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay thank you very much.

(DOCTOR OUT:  91:00 DOCTOR IN:  95:54)

DOCTOR Z459
After you get the EKG um, is she @@@ the machine right now? okay. So I talked with my attending and we think its best that you actually go to the Emergency Department right away.  There's a couple of lab tests that I wanted to order and it just happens a lot quicker if you just go there.  So after you get, you are going to get the EKG right now and then just go.

PATIENT Z459
Do you agree with it?

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah.

PATIENT Z459
Okay.

DOCTOR Z459
And we just want to make sure that there arenâ€™t any @@@ changes, not anything alarming,  it's just easier like if you're there to just hook him up to get another EKG there.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay. 

DOCTOR Z459
And then after that go to the Emergency Department.  @@@ send him down.

SECOND PERSON Z459
So what blood tests?  

DOCTOR Z459
So it's like a Troponin, that kind of thing.  They'll evaluate him down there, they'll get a chest x-ray right away, and theyâ€™ll do it right away so the doctors can look at it right away um you know and they'll see the EKG that we did.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Will they contact you?

DOCTOR Z459
Yeah, um they'll contact DOCTOR since she's your doctor but they'll take care of you down there, anything they can do to @@@ like that stress test I'm just going to go ahead and order it now.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR Z459
Um and they'll schedule that for you.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay but after NAME does this we'll send you down there.  I just want to make sure there's nothing very obvious on here okay.

SECOND PERSON Z459
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR Z459
Okay I'll be right in here.
