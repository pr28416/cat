DOCTOR.

DOCTOR E704
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E704
Yeah okay yeah.  Once I'm up there I would like to know what did the doc from upstairs, which I really did not like the doctor from the Pain Clinic.

DOCTOR E704
Oh you didn't?  What's the name?

PATIENT E704
That's what I'd like to know because every time I go up there there's like 10,000 different doctors I keep seeing.

DOCTOR E704
You need to see okay.  So the one you saw in December?

PATIENT E704
The one that I seen in December yes.  I tried to explain to him.

DOCTOR E704
Okay the Pain Fellow NAME?

PATIENT E704
Yes.  I tried to explain to him that the procedure that they did the month before.

DOCTOR E704
Oh.

PATIENT E704
Instead of doing good like all the other ones, it actually was worse.  I said the procedure must, you know if they don't work they must have been done wrong.  He said no none of the procedures have been done wrong.  If it doesn’t work it's not done wrong.  My, logically, it was done wrong.  Um well first of all I never feel the injections coming in and this one hurted like.

DOCTOR E704
Oh really.

PATIENT E704
A lot.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.

PATIENT E704
I mean yeah it was right where my pain was and what it did was make the pain even more worse.

DOCTOR E704
Really?

PATIENT E704
Yeah because by the time I got home.

DOCTOR E704
Hmm.

PATIENT E704
And moving around.  I'm not the type of person that I'm gonna sit down, it's just gonna make the pains more worse anyway.

DOCTOR E704
Hmm.

PATIENT E704
So.

DOCTOR E704
Okay give me one minute and I'm just gonna look at your chart here.

PATIENT E704
Sure.

DOCTOR E704
Since I haven't have a chance to look before. Medications, @@@.  Blood pressure @@@ Let’s see what they wanted to do the last time is, it looks like they saw you in the actual General Medicine Clinic last July, @@@ lumbar spine.  Okay. Question, did you ever see Neurosurgery about this back problem?

PATIENT E704
Uh yes I did.

DOCTOR E704
And what did they say?

PATIENT E704
Well I don't want to put them, you know they want to, but the only operation that I told them that I would let them do.

DOCTOR E704
Oh yeah okay.

PATIENT E704
Yeah, just letting you know.

DOCTOR E704
Uh-huh and that’s @@@.

PATIENT E704
It's not a neuro type of operation.

DOCTOR E704
That's fine, yeah because I know they’re not @@@.

PATIENT E704
Because I will not do it.

DOCTOR E704
@@@ pain.

PATIENT E704
Yeah.

DOCTOR E704
Okay so then.

PATIENT E704
But the only one that I would like to get operated is the two chipped because I don't know if that may be one of those chipped bones, the ones that are on the right side.

DOCTOR E704
What chipped?

PATIENT E704
I have two chipped bones on each side that are real pointy because I don't understand why the pain goes from the, from here from my back and it just constantly here, both constantly completely around my leg.

DOCTOR E704
Around your leg?

PATIENT E704
It doesn't, no, no, it doesn't go down my leg.  Not as much as it just stays around my pelvis and my hip together.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.  When you getting the previous pain shots they were working but this time it made it worse.

PATIENT E704
And this time it just made it worse.  So that's why I'm.

DOCTOR E704
@@@.

PATIENT E704
I had a, you know we had a disagreement of words
because first of all he was kind of telling me to try to give me some pill to put me to sleep.  That's supposed to leave you like a.

DOCTOR E704
Oh was it a muscle relaxer?

PATIENT E704
No, no, it's used for depression.  I told him no.  And it's no, for one there's no sleeping pills that work, supposed to make me sleep unless it's like a horse tranquilizer to knock me out but sleeping pills don't seem to work on me.  I don't, they'll knock me out for about the most, the maximum is maybe four hours and that's maximum.

DOCTOR E704
Uh-huh.  Well.

PATIENT E704
And I can take a really high dose, it still will not work.

DOCTOR E704
Got it.  So you’re taking gabapentin.

PATIENT E704
No.

DOCTOR E704
You're not taking that any more?

PATIENT E704
No I stopped taking the gabapentin.  I told them that since four months ago.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.

PATIENT E704
It was the beginning of summer because they were, the ones that I had I had to gradually put them down because I couldn't stop taking them because they were giving me an epileptic attack so I gradually had to stop, that's what the doctor told me.  So I gradually stopped you know, started taking less and less and less until finally because I stopped for the simple reason.

DOCTOR E704
Do you have a history of epilepsy?

PATIENT E704
No but they say if I stop taking the gabapentin.

DOCTOR E704
Oh @@@.

PATIENT E704
The doses that I was at that that could happen.

DOCTOR E704
@@@.

PATIENT E704
But.

DOCTOR E704
Are you taking the Vicodin right now?

PATIENT E704
I take the Vicodins.

DOCTOR E704
How much?

PATIENT E704
The Vicodins I take, I take one to two depending on the pain.

DOCTOR E704
How many times a day?

PATIENT E704
A day I take it maybe three times a day.

DOCTOR E704
Okay, what about.

PATIENT E704
Two to three times depending.  Now the.

DOCTOR E704
What about the morphine?

PATIENT E704
The morphines I was taking them as scheduled but I noticed that um.

DOCTOR E704
So you're not taking it?

PATIENT E704
When I don't take them.

DOCTOR E704
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E704
I get a tremendous knee, like joint pains, pains in my joints.  I get uh I guess that's the side effect of it but I get tremendous joint pain.

DOCTOR E704
Okay so are you taking it now or not?

PATIENT E704
Yes I've been taking one to two a day only.

DOCTOR E704
One to two a day.

PATIENT E704
I'm taking; I do take more of the Vicodins than I do take.

DOCTOR E704
Do you take the morphine 15 mg?

PATIENT E704
The 15 mg.

DOCTOR E704
When was the last time you got if filled?  Are you still taking, do you still have some?

PATIENT E704
I had some left, I just finished running out of them because last month they were gonna give them to me and I said no I just want to talk to them because I really didn't want to talk to that guy.  He really wasn't.

DOCTOR E704
The Pain Clinic was giving you Vicodin?

PATIENT E704
The Pain, yeah they said that they were going to transfer everything down here to the doctor because I just simply didn't want to talk to the guy.  The guy was in, he just kept with this thing that he wants to take me to um that I need to see a psychiatrist.  Why do I need to see a psychiatrist?  Oh it's part of the pain management.  Okay its part of the pain management and I can understand that but I don't want to see a psychiatrist.  Well you have no choice.  What do you mean I don't have no choice?

DOCTOR E704
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E704
No come on now, you trying to take me to go see a psychiatrist I have a physical problem not a mental problem.

DOCTOR E704
I understand.

PATIENT E704
Okay now I tried to explain that to him.  I says yes I do get stressed out.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.

PATIENT E704
I was stressed out at the time.  It took, it took the people here, it took them for about an hour and a half just to give me a really mild dose of something that was supposed to be an anti-depressant because I kept telling them I am not depressed.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.

PATIENT E704
I am stressed out.

DOCTOR E704
Got it.

PATIENT E704
Stressed.  I was living in a garage.

DOCTOR E704
Do you live @@@?

PATIENT E704
Yes, I have my own place.  You see my blood pressure went down.  My blood pressure was going high because @@@ I'm frustrated.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.

PATIENT E704
You know I'm not depressed because if I would've been depressed I would have been looking like I lived in a garage.  I maintained myself.  I always maintain myself you know.

DOCTOR E704
Right.

PATIENT E704
Mentally, physically.

DOCTOR E704
Right.

PATIENT E704
You know.

DOCTOR E704
Let me just look at this.  So basically you were taking Vicodin instead of the morphine?

PATIENT E704
Yes.

DOCTOR E704
Got it.

PATIENT E704
And then I ran out so I had no choice but to take, what did the urine come out?

DOCTOR E704
So you ran out of Vicodin?

PATIENT E704
When I ran out of the Vicodin.

DOCTOR E704
The Vicodin.

PATIENT E704
Because I usually have.

DOCTOR E704
So do you want to go back on Vicodin?

PATIENT E704
I want to go back to the Vicodin.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.

PATIENT E704
There's very little of the morphine.  Half of the morphine as a matter of fact, the pills of the morphine.  Because I only take them like once in a while.  If I really start feeling a lot of pain and I see that the Vicodin is not helping because I can only take a certain amount a day and I don't like to have it like two, three days taking that big amount of it so I try to take a morphine to kind of you know the Vicodins because the Vicodin can handle it.  I don't want my liver @@@.  I drink a lot of water you know so.  And I drink mineral water which is good and I drink a lot of tea.

DOCTOR E704
Oh okay.

PATIENT E704
Tea is very good.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah I know that because you stopped the gabapentin but the medication that he also gave you amitriptyline actually we do prescribe it for people with that kind of nerve pain, the physical nerve pain you know.  The medicines have different uses for them and not everything has to be.

PATIENT E704
That's the one, the anti-depression one that he supposedly.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah it's classified, technically for marketing purposes it is classified as neuropathic pain but um we do use that for neuropathic pain. If you don't want to use the gabapentin.

PATIENT E704
Then I can use that.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah you could use that actually.

PATIENT E704
So he said one pill to go to sleep though, that's what he told me.

DOCTOR E704
@@@.

PATIENT E704
Okay.

DOCTOR E704
Let me just see if I can.  Oh I see.  Um did he offer a second injection?  I guess you didn't want it from him right?

PATIENT E704
No.

DOCTOR E704
Do you want it with someone else?  So do you want to go back to the clinic, do you want to see someone else?  Is that what it is?

PATIENT E704
I wanted the guy that did it before not him.

DOCTOR E704
Okay but you were okay with someone else?

PATIENT E704
Yeah, yes, yes.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.

PATIENT E704
Right.

DOCTOR E704
Not that guy.

PATIENT E704
No I just want the.

DOCTOR E704
Okay um.

PATIENT E704
Yeah because sometimes I go there and it's like you notice in the records it's never the same guy.

DOCTOR E704
So they did try but I'll put another consult in and see and you would like to have it be to repeat injection and I'll make sure you know you can specify it or when they call to make the appointment you can always.  The name of the person was DOCTOR.

PATIENT E704
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E704
Okay, if it's possible just be like oh no DOCTOR just be like I would like it with another Pain Clinic doctor other than DOCTOR.

PATIENT E704
The best person they had up there was DOCTOR.

DOCTOR E704
So just request DOCTOR, how do you spell it?

PATIENT E704
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR E704
I'll put it in.

PATIENT E704
DOCTOR but he's moved, he's gone.

DOCTOR E704
So who else is there?

PATIENT E704
Uh the ones from before him, the German guy, is he German?

DOCTOR E704
I don't know, I don't know people.

PATIENT E704
I don't either.

DOCTOR E704
How about DOCTOR?

PATIENT E704
Yeah.

DOCTOR E704
Is he good?

PATIENT E704
Uh the one from, not December, the one from three months ago.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.

PATIENT E704
That's him.  The last injection I think I had was either in September or October.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.

PATIENT E704
Whoever that doctor was.

DOCTOR E704
DOCTOR?

PATIENT E704
There you go.

DOCTOR E704
You want him?

PATIENT E704
Yeah.

DOCTOR E704
Okay then I'll refer to him.

PATIENT E704
Much better.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.

PATIENT E704
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.  Sometimes you can go see online what they have over there you know I mean.

PATIENT E704
It varies.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.

PATIENT E704
Never the same person right.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah we're fine.  Alright.  So you need refills of everything.

PATIENT E704
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.

PATIENT E704
And if you can give me more of Vicodin.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.

PATIENT E704
Okay.

DOCTOR E704
Um for you, it's sort of like well I'll meet the patient and I'm like oh maybe Vicodin will need to be filled but you're really taking the steps to improve the pain.  You definitely have very severe lumbar back pain.

PATIENT E704
Right I do.

DOCTOR E704
And you need the medicines so.

PATIENT E704
Right.

DOCTOR E704
That's fine okay.

PATIENT E704
That's just.

DOCTOR E704
That's fine.

PATIENT E704
But I'm also a very skeptic type of person.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.

PATIENT E704
When it comes to medicine, I'm not a medicine person.

DOCTOR E704
No I think yeah.

PATIENT E704
That's why I'd rather have the you know the discussion with the doctor and let them know what I feel, how I feel about the medicine because if I don't then it'd just be like something that I just be like oh no that's not really doing me good.  It's just like okay like if you're, I don't like a certain beer cause it does me wrong and then all the fellows, that's all they drink now am I gonna drink the same beer just to be hanging out with them.  You understand?

DOCTOR E704
Right.

PATIENT E704
Even though it's tearing me apart.

DOCTOR E704
Did you go have physical therapy?

PATIENT E704
Uh physical no, but not to say that she told me to reschedule me and then also I would like to know if I can get rescheduled through cause I was supposed to have done my MRIs redone because it's been two years ago.

DOCTOR E704
Oh.

PATIENT E704
Because I missed my appointment.

DOCTOR E704
The last MRI of the lumbar spine was last year in February so it hasn't been two years, it's been one year.

PATIENT E704
The MRI?

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.  Of the lumbar spine?

PATIENT E704
Oh because I came on an emergency I think it was.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.

PATIENT E704
On the 24th, somewhere around there.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.

PATIENT E704
That's right I forgot I had came in on emergency.

DOCTOR E704
So I don't think you need another one.

PATIENT E704
No okay.

DOCTOR E704
@@@.  And the cervical one do you still have a lot of neck pain?

PATIENT E704
The neck pain, it's even here, it's always there but the pressures not there.

DOCTOR E704
Got it.  So that's fine you don't have to get another one.

PATIENT E704
Yeah that's the main, the main thing is as long as I don't feel like I'm carrying a big elephant in my back and my neck I can deal with the crackling cause I do do the exercises every day.

DOCTOR E704
Oh.

PATIENT E704
Alright.

DOCTOR E704
Very good.

PATIENT E704
And I don't carry anything in my hands; I can't carry nothing in my hands.

DOCTOR E704
Oh.

PATIENT E704
I carry it in my shoulder cause if I carry it in my hands it hurts my shoulders.

DOCTOR E704
Oh.

PATIENT E704
And if I carry it on my shoulders it doesn't hurt my shoulders but if I carry it in my hands it hurts my shoulders.  Totally backwards.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.  I'm gonna listen to you okay.

PATIENT E704
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E704
No other problems, you been doing okay?

PATIENT E704

PATIENT E704
No @@@.

DOCTOR E704
Oh I won't @@@ okay.

PATIENT E704
For some reason why is I can't sit like, like.

DOCTOR E704
Stand up for me.

PATIENT E704
Like some people like sit back and put, like okay, like okay if I sit like this where I have pressure on my back I can't do that for too long but for some reason it's like, like I'm building up the whole pressure it ends up like all the way up here.

DOCTOR E704
Oh really.

PATIENT E704
Yeah so I can't lay in the bed now, like the guys laying there the bed like put the pillow there because by some reason the pressure.  I don't know if it's the nerves.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah because it's like when you put your head back it further closing the disk space so that there's already a narrowing there sustained.

PATIENT E704
Oh that's what caused that.

DOCTOR E704
You're narrowing it a little bit more and that's how you've got pressure.

PATIENT E704
Woo cause boy does it and it hurts really bad.

DOCTOR E704
That's why, yeah.

PATIENT E704
If feel like I have a really bad headache.

DOCTOR E704
That's why and you can't really bend down?  You don't have to bend down as much.

PATIENT E704
Um.

DOCTOR E704
Is it hard?

PATIENT E704
Bend down it's like okay.

DOCTOR E704
Okay don't bend down if you're gonna hurt yourself.

PATIENT E704
No but sometimes I have to do that because of the side, the whole thing.

DOCTOR E704
You can sit back up okay.

PATIENT E704
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT E704
But it's not the bending down so much it's this that bothers me, it’s like, you know like washing the sink when you wash the dishes or something, you tend to be very a little bit tilted.

DOCTOR E704
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E704
Lasts maybe 15 seconds or so.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah I'll be back.

PATIENT E704
Something like that and then that's really bad the pain.

DOCTOR E704
Yeah.  It's @@@.  Okay.

PATIENT E704

DOCTOR E704
Oh.  Okay and I'll order the amitriptyline for you and you can try it and see and, @@@, if it doesn't work, it doesn’t work, you know.  But it is something that can be useful for neuropathic pain if you don't want to take the, the gabapentin  should be really good, but if you don't want to take that, that’s fine,  then we can try something else.  

PATIENT E704
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E704
If you don't want to take that, it's totally up to you.

PATIENT E704
Okay.

DOCTOR E704
Okay.

PATIENT E704
