PATIENT U651
Oh wow.

DOCTOR U651
Okay because I want to see if you have osteoarthritis.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  Osteoarthritis is when the space in between two bones shrinks.

PATIENT U651
Right.

DOCTOR U651
When you get bone on bone.

DOCTOR U651
Yeah I mean it doesn't seem like there is one particular thing that makes this a lot worse uh it just kind of bothers you.

PATIENT U651
Okay yeah.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  Um it's a tough thing to treat, I'll just tell you.  It's a tough thing to treat because there isn't a good surgery for this.

PATIENT U651
No.

DOCTOR U651
Uh you know so the thing that I need to make sure is that your bones, the health of your bones overall.

PATIENT U651
Right.

DOCTOR U651

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Now, PATIENT let's talk about the chest pain.

PATIENT U651
Okay good.

DOCTOR U651
Okay because the chest pain is not from your heart.

PATIENT U651
@@@

DOCTOR U651
Well you've got an aneurysm but that that doesn't cause chest pain.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  We're gonna continue to monitor that.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Um but there's nothing to do right now.

PATIENT U651
Right.

DOCTOR U651
And that's not the cause of this pain.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
So but you're still having pain.  I believe you.

PATIENT U651
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U651
So we've got to figure out what.

PATIENT U651
What it is?

DOCTOR U651
Uh what is that pain and what can we do about it.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Now I need you to think really hard.  Does the pain that you get in the chest is it ever related to food ever?

PATIENT U651
No.

DOCTOR U651
Never.

PATIENT U651
No.

DOCTOR U651

No I don't get gas.

DOCTOR U651
Well it's not just gas.  There's something called acid reflux.

PATIENT U651
Let me tell you what it is.  Sharp pain.

DOCTOR U651
It's sharp pain.

PATIENT U651
Right in here.

DOCTOR U651
And how long does it last?

PATIENT U651
Well sometimes it lasts four, five hours.  Sometimes it can come @@@ it will cause me to take aspirin every once in a while.  I took them up but it still hurts.  The aspirin don't do anything you know, like when I'm just about really go do it, @@@stronger than that, you know what I'm saying.

DOCTOR U651
You don't okay.  Um not, no spicy foods, it makes this worse?

PATIENT U651
No, no.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  Coffee.

PATIENT U651

PATIENT U651
A little pain, but not much.

Okay.  Well.

PATIENT U651
It sure is not gas was it.

DOCTOR U651
No I think it's a muscle.

PATIENT U651
Hmm.

DOCTOR U651
That, just doing that motion and it causes pain.

PATIENT U651
No not this one over here does.

DOCTOR U651
That one over there?

PATIENT U651
Yeah.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  Okay.  Um what do you do with that arm?

PATIENT U651
What do I do with that arm?

DOCTOR U651
Okay like do you like, do you have you know small children or anything you have to pick up?

Oh yeah, yeah, my grandson's he's at least six months so I tell her I can't hold him too long, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR U651
Yeah.

PATIENT U651
That's why, he weighs about 20 pounds, 25 pounds, something like that.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  My friend, I think that this is a muscle pain.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
So what I want you to do is rest and ice it.

PATIENT U651
Hmm.

DOCTOR U651
I want you to stick something cold on there.

PATIENT U651
Hmm.

DOCTOR U651

PATIENT U651
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  If it persists then maybe it is something like gas.

PATIENT U651
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U651
But I'm not gonna give you another medicine right now cause I'm less suspicious that this is gas.

PATIENT U651
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U651
I'm more suspicious that this is a muscle.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
I do think it might be worth getting a picture of the knee just to see that there isn't anything that is really abnormal and to see if this could be osteoarthritis.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  Um and again this has been a long term pain issue for you.

No not worse it's just the pain @@@.  But I'm trying not to walk too far every day but I still have @@@ you know stuff like that.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  I think that you moving is a great idea because being around lots of cockroaches and mice.

DOCTOR U651
Okay well it could be a headache.  But I mean it could be migraines.

PATIENT U651
Hmm.

DOCTOR U651
Um there are medicines that are available that you can take once the headache starts.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Um I haven't prescribed it to people yet here at the VA cause I haven't had too many folks that have true migraines.

PATIENT U651
Yeah.

DOCTOR U651
This could be true migraines um, let me see if they have them.  

PATIENT U651
And I hate to tell you this but before you gave me some Viagra.

DOCTOR U651
Yeah.

PATIENT U651
One pill for a month! Come on I had the only one pill, one pill?

DOCTOR U651
I didn't give you just one.  Now listen the VA restricts me.

PATIENT U651
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  I'm only allowed to give you two pills a month.  If it was only one that was a mistake.  It was meant to be two.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Um but the issue, here I'm changing this right now.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Um I don't know why the VA does this.  You know you were in the Army you know or some service and now they want to control every part of your life.  I don't know what the story is behind that but they only let me prescribe two pills a month.

PATIENT U651
I only got one.  Now you see what I'm saying, one pill.

DOCTOR U651
Yeah.

PATIENT U651
One pill, one pill you know get your girlfriend or something, you know what I mean and she want to do some more.

DOCTOR U651
Yeah.  Okay my friend.  Um when I look at this uh the medicine that I was thinking I wanted to give you.

PATIENT U651
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U651
It turns out I can only give to you if I'm a neurologist.

PATIENT U651
Uh-huh.  Well is the fact that @@@ well you the doctor, @@@ what do you think about that?

DOCTOR U651
We talked about that.  They want to monitor that in a year.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
There's nothing to do.  There's no problem related to your heart.

PATIENT U651
Right.

DOCTOR U651
You're heart's healthy but you do have a little bit of dilation of the aorta.

PATIENT U651
Right.

DOCTOR U651
And there's nothing to do about it.  We're just gonna monitor it.

PATIENT U651
Oh okay.

DOCTOR U651
To make sure that it doesn't, if it gets bigger, eventually you might have to have a surgery.

PATIENT U651
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U651
But right now there isn't any indication to have to do that okay.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
I can uh you know, I can refer you to the neurologist.

PATIENT U651
No, no.

DOCTOR U651
For the headache and they can prescribe you the medicine for, specific for migraines.  From the sound of it, it could be migraines.

PATIENT U651
Hmm.  Let's hope it is cause I don't want to take @@@.  I can't come over here, I got to stay all the way.

DOCTOR U651
Right, right, right @@@.

PATIENT U651
Hospital @@@.

DOCTOR U651
You're not taking the right medicine for migraine.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
I want to give you something but the VA is limiting me.  I can't give you this medicine unless I'm a neurologist so I can send you to the neurologist and they can assess your headaches.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
And see if they will do it.

PATIENT U651
Alright, alright, alright, alright.  @@@.

DOCTOR U651

PATIENT U651
No @@@.

DOCTOR U651
Um it is uh I believe you go to the Damon Center and it's in the Damon Center but I would have you, what I'd have you do is ask the folks at the desk and they'll be able to tell you exactly where it is.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
I'm pretty sure that's where it is.

PATIENT U651
Okay.

DOCTOR U651
Okay.  Yeah I'm glad that you asked that. I neglected to say that.  Okay.

PATIENT U651
I would probably do that for the others ones cause I had one once before you know and after I was done I just didn't get another one, you know what I mean.  You want me to get a flu shot while I'm here too?

DOCTOR U651
Yeah well it's kind of you're getting to the end of the flu season but do you need a flu shot?

PATIENT U651
