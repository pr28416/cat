PATIENT X696
How are you?  Hello doc.

DOCTOR X696
Hey, I was looking for you.

PATIENT X696
I uh.

DOCTOR X696
How do you do.

PATIENT X696
I'm doing that on Monday, Fridays.

DOCTOR X696
Alright.  Uh we have @@@ comfortable but.  How are you today?

PATIENT X696
Doing okay.

DOCTOR X696
Alright.  Are you here uh for a check-up?

PATIENT X696
You see I got this thing and I don't know what it is down here.  @@@.

DOCTOR X696
You got a little bit of a wart; it looks like it's got infected.

PATIENT X696
I think it's just.

DOCTOR X696
How long has that been going on for?

PATIENT X696
It started, it's why they burst, you know I put a Band-Aid on, I put some compression and put a Band-Aid on.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah that's probably the best thing to do uh I mean there's nothing really you know we can give you here for it other than just advice to keep it clean and dry and you know.

PATIENT X696
I keep it clean.

DOCTOR X696
Avoid like you know getting dirt in it.

PATIENT X696
And that's why I put a Band-Aid on it.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got to wash it, I could say at least three times a day and keep it clean, good.

PATIENT X696
But I have no more Band-Aids.

DOCTOR X696
Um so as far as a general uh health maintenance stuff I think that uh the blood pressure is probably a little bit on the high side today uh.  Did you have a chance to take your medicines this morning or?

PATIENT X696
I forgot to take it today.

DOCTOR X696
Yeah okay.  Well like do you need a refill on any of them or?

PATIENT X696
Yeah just mail it to me.

DOCTOR X696
Just mail it at home to you?  Do you have enough at home @@@.

PATIENT X696
I have enough you know today but I don't have enough till the next time I come here.

DOCTOR X696
Okay, okay.  Well the issue is that we think that your uh blood pressure is actually dangerously high, uh at which point it seems as though based on your last blood work a year ago you have, uh the problem is is when people have kind of longstanding high blood pressures they uh, it can actually, it starts to damage other organs because the pressure's so high and the first organ damaged is usually the kidney.  Um based on your blood work which was April @@, @@@@, um your kidney function is less than 50%.  So that's fine, I mean people can live with 50% of their kidneys you know no problem but if it continues to decline and we don't get your blood pressure under control and this is why I’m so concerned about it today, once you get to about 10% that's when people need to go on dialysis.

PATIENT X696
I know.

DOCTOR X696
So you're halfway, more than halfway there to needing dialysis.

PATIENT X696
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X696
So it's just um, it's so important.  That's why it's so important and I want you to know dialysis is a miserable lifestyle.

PATIENT X696
I know.

DOCTOR X696
You have to go in two times a week.  You have to stay, it's nothing good about it – it’s bad.  Um and you know.

PATIENT X696
So hey I want to get this under control.

DOCTOR X696
So that's why, so that's why it's important to you know have, you know for us to talk now and um for you to get your blood pressure under control so we can preserve what you have left because there's no magic pill to regrow your kidneys.

PATIENT X696
I know.

DOCTOR X696
Just you know, technically just can't do it.  Um otherwise you know I think that should be the main issue uh for today.  Um.

PATIENT X696
I guarantee when I come back in here it'll be better.

DOCTOR X696
Okay, okay.  I mean it's not for me; it's for you you know.

PATIENT X696
Yeah, yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR X696
Well if you'll have a seat I'll take a quick listen to you.  I'd like for you to come back in two weeks.
