PATIENT G287
Okay.

DOCTOR G287
Okay.

PATIENT G287
Before June.

DOCTOR G287
Okay.

PATIENT G287

PATIENT G287
Not very often anymore since I stopped taking the medicine.  Uh well I didn't really stop taking the medicine it just ran out because you guys were charging me for it.

DOCTOR G287
Oh which one?

PATIENT G287
Uh so I was taking metformin and something for blood pressure.

DOCTOR G287
Um okay let me pull up your list.

PATIENT G287
You can get it from the old records, I don't know.

DOCTOR G287
Yeah you need to take those medicines.  Um if you get it through the VA it's gonna be that expensive.

PATIENT G287

DOCTOR G287
And your blood pressure is a little; it's greater than what we wanted um because for a diabetic you want it to be less than 130/80.  So @@@. We need to do a lot today.  I'm going to write about this.  Let's take a listen to you.  Okay.  Have you had an Eye Clinic, Eye Clinic within the past year?

There's always been real dry skin under there because I tend to wear my socks high.

DOCTOR G287
Oh okay.  Deep breaths.  Look at my face.  Do you do exercise and stuff like that?

PATIENT G287
I walk a lot and I tend to take about an hour and a half, two hour walk at least three times a week, weather permitting.

DOCTOR G287
Good.  And you ought to continue doing that.

PATIENT G287
Yeah I like that.

DOCTOR G287
Yeah.  Follow my finger okay.  Look at me, straight ahead okay. Alrighty.  So I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR and we'll just get everything set up.  I need see what of insulin you were on @@@ enough.  I'm gonna @@@ metformin.  The thing is @@@ only thing that's been here, you don't even know @@@.  Well actually what we'll do is we'll check an A1c and then so you were just on metformin.

PATIENT G287
I was on something for um.

DOCTOR G287
Blood pressure.

PATIENT G287

DOCTOR G287
No.  I'll send you a letter or call you.  So CBC, liver, lipids @@@ A1c okay.  

PATIENT G287
Yeah let's not go too crazy on the medicines so three is fine.  I think you know my wife she passed away from pancreatitis.

DOCTOR G287
Hmm, sorry.

PATIENT G287
And she was on like 16 different meds.

DOCTOR G287
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G287
And I so there’s a part of me that thinks they were over medicating her.

DOCTOR G287
Right.

PATIENT G287
Yeah.

DOCTOR G287
But for your diabetes you need to be on some medication.

PATIENT G287
Oh I understand I just don't want to have the situation where I'm taking you know 12-13 different types of pills.

DOCTOR G287
You won't be.  Um window or mail?

PATIENT G287
I'm sorry?

DOCTOR G287
Pick up your medicine at the window or?

PATIENT G287
Oh you can mail it to me I guess.

DOCTOR G287
Okay.

PATIENT G287
Cause I have other errands that I need to run today.

DOCTOR G287
Okay no problem.  Metformin.

PATIENT G287
You guys have done that before and I think that's pretty cool.

DOCTOR G287
Yeah we're gonna do metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. 

PATIENT G287
Now should I, cause you know I was talking to a friend of mine who also takes metformin and he told me that because I hadn't taken it sometimes for diabetes that you always have to be sure to take it after you eat something.

DOCTOR G287
Yeah you should, on a full stomach cause then you'll feel, you'll get like gassy and all that.

PATIENT G287
Yeah cause that's what the guy was saying you can get a really bad upset stomach.

DOCTOR G287
Yeah.  And glyburide.

PATIENT G287
Yeah glyburide was another one.

DOCTOR G287
We'll do 10.

PATIENT G287
I'm pretty sure I can keep it down.  I mean I walk enough, I walk regularly and I've lost about 20 pounds.

DOCTOR G287
That's good.

PATIENT G287
In the last six months or so.

DOCTOR G287
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G287
I mean I don't try to diet or anything like that.

DOCTOR G287
Yeah.

PATIENT G287
But I'm not eating as much processed food and I don't go to those fast food places.

DOCTOR G287
That's good.

PATIENT G287
So I mean I do eat red meat and I tend to eat a lot when I do eat.

DOCTOR G287
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G287
But I really only try to eat meat like one @@@ every day.

DOCTOR G287
Why don't we put you back on the hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure?

PATIENT G287
Okay.

DOCTOR G287
And I'll leave it at that okay and then Naproxen.  The Naproxen you have to take omeprazole with it because it's something for your, it'll upset your stomach.  Okay.

PATIENT G287
Oh you said you could handle the referral so that I could just call and make an appointment with Physical Therapy?

DOCTOR G287
Yeah.  Uh-huh.

PATIENT G287
That'll save me another trip today.

DOCTOR G287
Okay so we're all set and you're done.

PATIENT G287
So I just take the lab work and then you'll mail me the letter?

DOCTOR G287
Yeah.

PATIENT G287
Okay and I'll have to start taking it today.

DOCTOR G287
The meds?

PATIENT G287
Yeah.

DOCTOR G287
Well I mean, I don't know how long it'll take for the mail.

PATIENT G287
Yeah.

DOCTOR G287
Maybe by Monday you'll get them.

PATIENT G287
Oh yeah that'll be fine.

DOCTOR G287
And then.

PATIENT G287
Cause I've gone without them for a long time.

DOCTOR G287
Take a look at the instructions okay and then we'll see you in the clinic maybe in two months.

PATIENT G287
Okay but go to the Lab first right?

DOCTOR G287
Yeah.

PATIENT G287
Okay.  Thank you very much.

DOCTOR G287
Okay nice to meet you.  I'm DOCTOR by the way.

PATIENT G287
Nice to meet you doctor.

DOCTOR G287
Okay.  Take care.

PATIENT G287
Tell DOCTOR I said hello.

DOCTOR G287
Okay.  She's with patients.

PATIENT G287
Okay she actually called me cause I hadn't shown up in a long time.

DOCTOR G287
Yeah.  She gets concerned.

PATIENT G287
She was like you know where you been?

DOCTOR G287
Yeah.

PATIENT G287
So then I started one of those, for some reason they determined that I was making enough money so that I could get uh.

DOCTOR G287
Yeah.

PATIENT G287
Start paying, that's the thing that I really couldn't afford to have it taken out of my income tax.

DOCTOR G287
Oh.

PATIENT G287
About $130 but to me that seemed like a lot.

DOCTOR G287
That is a lot yeah.  That's a lot for me too.

PATIENT G287
So if I call in six different medicines plus the strips and things like that.

DOCTOR G287
Uh-huh yeah.

PATIENT G287
Did you order me more strips by the way as well?  Like along with all the other stuff?

DOCTOR G287
No I didn't, let me put that in.

PATIENT G287
Just so I could have the records, I couldn't tell you what kind of machine I have.

DOCTOR G287
Yeah I'll need to know so I can order the strips correctly.  Um what I would do is I would call.  I would look at the machine and call the pharmacist here and ask what type of machine it is so then they can send me little like reminder to order it.

PATIENT G287
Okay that's fine.

DOCTOR G287
Okay.  Alright.  Take care.

PATIENT G287
Thank you very much.

DOCTOR G287
You're welcome.

PATIENT G287
Have a good weekend.

DOCTOR G287
