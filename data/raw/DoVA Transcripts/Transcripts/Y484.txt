PATIENT Y484
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Y484
They probably think, if it comes down to it, what they can do is take a sample, like a you know a small biopsy and review it under the microscope.

PATIENT Y484
Why they have to do all that?

DOCTOR Y484
No sometimes.  They, that's why they didn't do it yet but if its something that's really bothering you and it's not getting better you know we can, do you know what I mean?

DOCTOR Y484
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y484
Get rid of this cough and then use the patches I got.

DOCTOR Y484
You have the patches already?

PATIENT Y484
Yeah.

DOCTOR Y484
I think you should try using them.

PATIENT Y484
Yeah.

DOCTOR Y484
And you don't have to wait until the cough is gone.

PATIENT Y484
Yeah.

DOCTOR Y484
If anything that's probably a good time because the smoking is probably going to make the cough worse.

PATIENT Y484
Yeah but that's @@@.

DOCTOR Y484
Take a deep breath.  Is there anything new about the cough or is it just @@@?  Are you coughing up junk?  You got any mucous?
