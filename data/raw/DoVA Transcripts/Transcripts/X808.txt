PATIENT X808
Hmm.

DOCTOR X808

PATIENT X808
Uh right big toe.  See in the left.

DOCTOR X808
Do you have any swelling there?  It's not anywhere in your foot?

PATIENT X808
Usually it's in the left big toe.  Sometimes it's you know, it moves over to the right foot, seems like in the middle of the foot seems like but mostly it's in the left big toe.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  I have a question, your diabetes has not been controlled for a while um, we look at this number called the hemoglobin A1c, we want it here, it was when it was controlled and here it's relatively controlled in ‘05.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
But the last one was in the summer was 8.3.  We want it ideally to be less than 7.

PATIENT X808
Right.

DOCTOR X808
Are you checking your blood sugar only once a day or two hours after you eat or before you eat?

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh you know I just recently started doing the two hours after cause I was doing it like right after I eat or wait an hour after I eat.

DOCTOR X808
Okay so if you're gonna check it after you've eaten, do it two hours after you eat.

PATIENT X808
Yeah.

DOCTOR X808
Otherwise check it before you eat and see how its running during the middle of the day.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
Um and likely you're only taking metformin right for diabetes?

PATIENT X808
And glipizide.

DOCTOR X808
Oh you are taking glipizide.

PATIENT X808
Yes, I need a refill on that twice a day.

DOCTOR X808
So how much glipizide?

PATIENT X808
Uh a tablet and a half.

DOCTOR X808
10, 20 mg, 50 mg?

PATIENT X808
Uh can't remember which one it is.  I know I take a pill and a half a day.

DOCTOR X808
Oh okay, so you're taking 50 mg.  When did you stop taking that?

PATIENT X808
I hadn't stopped taking it unless I run out of it.

DOCTOR X808
Oh really.

PATIENT X808
Yeah.  When I was here last week they told me to stop taking the colchicine.

DOCTOR X808
Oh you were taking it pretty consistently?

PATIENT X808
Yeah.

DOCTOR X808
You were taking the colchicine and allopurinol?

PATIENT X808
At one point I was.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.

PATIENT X808
Hmm.

DOCTOR X808
@@@ So that was stopped.

PATIENT X808
Hmm.

DOCTOR X808
Colchicine and allopurinol.  Per month or per year how many episodes do you get while on the allopurinol?

PATIENT X808
Oh man, I'd say about three.

DOCTOR X808
So that's three episodes a year?

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh about that.  Sometimes it seems like a little more but.

DOCTOR X808
@@@.  These are the ones you take.  @@@ When was the last time you saw an eye doctor?

PATIENT X808

PATIENT X808
No but I need to.  I was gonna ask to see the orthopedic for my knee you know, the podiatrist about my right heel.

DOCTOR X808
Okay so the last time you saw Podiatry was a long time ago.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Looks like ‘08.  Do you take hydrochlorothiazide too?

PATIENT X808
No they told me to stop taking that.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.

PATIENT X808
That was a couple of weeks ago.

DOCTOR X808
And you're checking your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT X808
Yes.

DOCTOR X808
And it's running pretty good?

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
@@@ kidney doctor. So they're probably just gonna watch you.  The ultrasound looks okay.  Um we're gonna check, so we can check AFP, UA, PTT, @@@.  Are you taking the high dose vitamin B, the ergocalciferol?  

PATIENT X808
Right.  But I just started that.

DOCTOR X808
You just started that?

PATIENT X808
Yeah I think I've taken the second one.  Well I've taken it on Wednesday and this will be like the third one tomorrow, it's the third time I took. I just got it.

DOCTOR X808
DOCTOR put you on that?

PATIENT X808
Uh no it was, whoever I was seeing at the Gold Clinic.

DOCTOR X808
Oh you were in the Gold Clinic?

PATIENT X808
This was last week when I was there.

DOCTOR X808
Huh.

PATIENT X808
Over in the Gold Clinic.  That's why I hadn't been over here in a while.

DOCTOR X808
Oh okay the last appointment was @@@.  

PATIENT X808
Now last week they was telling me something about magnesium.

DOCTOR X808
Yeah your magnesium is low.  Are you taking your potassium?

PATIENT X808
I haven't had it, I haven't got anything.

DOCTOR X808
Okay well we'll refill it okay.  Um they did order it for you.

PATIENT X808
Hmm I haven't received it yet.

DOCTOR X808
Oh really.  

PATIENT X808
Now certain food, does all food have magnesium or certain foods have magnesium?

DOCTOR X808
Well, I know what foods have potassium; I don't know what food has magnesium.

PATIENT X808
Magnesium.  Cause the way it was explained to me it was something like uh I'm not getting enough magnesium through my food or something and so I need to know what foods have magnesium.

DOCTOR X808
Um you're chronically low, just take supplements.

PATIENT X808
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  Um so that's done and then okay so today we need labs okay.  

PATIENT X808
Again, I was here labs last week.

DOCTOR X808
@@@, so we don't need some of the labs, this you got so that's good.  Um but you do need @@@.  You need refills of all your meds?

PATIENT X808
I need refills on the glipizide.

DOCTOR X808
Okay and metformin?

PATIENT X808
Metformin I think I'm pretty good on.

DOCTOR X808
@@@?

PATIENT X808
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X808
Oh any test strips?

PATIENT X808
Uh yes.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  Rosuvastatin?

PATIENT X808
I think I just got that.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.

PATIENT X808
Recently yeah.

DOCTOR X808
Allopurinol?

PATIENT X808
Uh.

DOCTOR X808
@@@.  

PATIENT X808
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X808
So you need that.

PATIENT X808
Yeah.

DOCTOR X808
I would try to stay away from colchicine.

PATIENT X808
Hmm.

DOCTOR X808
If you get gout maybe they can give you some prednisone for kidney function.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
But um I'll leave that to DOCTOR okay.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.  So you're saying that the uh colchicine that's uh.

DOCTOR X808
It can hurt the kidneys.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  Um that’s why you’re not on chronic colchicine therapy.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
But um if you get an attack um well, you have diabetes @@@.

PATIENT X808
That's a steroid isn't it?

DOCTOR X808
Uh-huh.  Yeah @@@.  Let me talk to DOCTOR about it okay.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Um lisinopril right?

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Do you want them mailed?

PATIENT X808
Yeah by mail.

DOCTOR X808
Not at the window?

PATIENT X808
No. It takes too long.

DOCTOR X808
Oh does it?

PATIENT X808
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.

PATIENT X808
When you come back tomorrow I'll still be there waiting to get it.

DOCTOR X808
Oh, now. (Laughs.) Oh okay.

PATIENT X808
And the, does it say anything about the magnesium?

DOCTOR X808
Yes.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
Okay @@@ the gout.  I think what you need to do is check your sugars in the middle of the day.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Um and see, do you think your sugars on the whole have been improving or just have been staying the same?

PATIENT X808
I'd say half and half.  I think they're improving but I mean I haven't, the highest I ever seen was like 180.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  So @@@ glipizide um you know you should check your sugars in the middle of the day and come back for an appointment cause.

PATIENT X808
Hmm.

DOCTOR X808
I think @@@ your diabetes has not been controlled but it improved slightly since June but every three months that's for the control for every three months.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
So you probably do have to go up on the glipizide.  When did you start the glipizide?

PATIENT X808
Oh it's been a while, at least a couple years I think.

DOCTOR X808
Really.

PATIENT X808
Yeah.

DOCTOR X808
Why didn't they increase the @@@?  Maybe they wanted to see if it got any better.  Um how would you feel about injecting yourself with insulin?

PATIENT X808
No.

DOCTOR X808
You won't?

PATIENT X808
No.

DOCTOR X808
Not under any circumstances?

PATIENT X808
No.

DOCTOR X808
No.  Um and is there a reason why?

PATIENT X808
Well one I don't want to and the other part is I drive truck if I'm shooting insulin I can't drive.  I'm a truck driver.

DOCTOR X808
Hmm.  What if we increase the glipizide as much as we can and really there’s no – once someone is on two drugs for oral?

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
For diabetes and if they are still not controlled, then we suggest insulin. I can always increase this and see how you do.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
Um but the control of the diabetes is really, really important.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
So you know @@@ your legs and heart attacks and strokes, and all those complications.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
That's why we really want your diabetes controlled.  @@@ and I'll talk to DOCTOR and see okay.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
Um any changes in your vision?  Changes in the sensation in your leg?  

PATIENT X808
No.

DOCTOR X808
Chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT X808
No.

DOCTOR X808
No.  Increased fluid, retention?

PATIENT X808
Just fat.  I’m just kidding.

DOCTOR X808
@@@.  Okay.  Can you lean forward for me please sir?  Deep breath out again out.  Okay, do you smoke?

PATIENT X808
No.

DOCTOR X808
Have you ever?

PATIENT X808
Never.

DOCTOR X808
Very good.  Let me see if you have any swelling.  No swelling at all.  Open your mouth for me.  Alright @@@.  Good.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  26:59  DOCTOR IN:  47:17)

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  So here's the thing.  The best thing to do for these attacks while you’re still on allopurinol.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  Um we're gonna restart you back on the colchicine cause colchicine can really prevent attacks.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
But that's usually good up to like six months and I'm also gonna send you to Renal and Rheumatology.  Um and Rheumatology because of this recurrent gout to see if there's any other medications they can put you on.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  And to see you have to continue the colchicine um so just 0.6 mg per day.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  If you so wish to hold off on the colchicine until you see Rheumatology that's up to you.

PATIENT X808
How long will it take to see Rheumatology?

DOCTOR X808
Huh?

PATIENT X808
How long will it take for that appointment?

DOCTOR X808
Um to be really honest I don't know.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
I don't think it'll be, like, incredibly long I think I mean its Rheumatology, I think they should be able to see you hopefully soon.  Um what I'll do is on this follow-up sheet, I'll put the consult in and I'll say @@@ in a month.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  So you can see them and see how that goes.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
And then I also want you to see the kidney doctors.

PATIENT X808
Hmm.

DOCTOR X808
To make sure everything is stable and to investigate why you're having, what is causing this insufficiency of your kidneys.  Oh shoot.  

(DOCTOR OUT:  48:52  DOCTOR IN:  49:17)

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  Um so there's various things that can cause kidney inefficiency, one is uncontrolled diabetes.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
One is high blood pressure gets out of control and your blood pressure looks controlled.  One is recurrent gout.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Um but I want you to see the kidney doctors so they can watch you and prevent any further progression.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
Okay um and what I'm gonna do for your diabetes is increase the glipizide.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
From 1 1/2 to 2 tablets.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  So it’s 20 mgs um after that, I'll double check but after that um if when DOCTOR rechecks the hemoglobin A1c we may have to consider insulin but we'll see what happens okay.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
I know it's tough but maybe you can stop on the side in the truck and its.  We just want to prevent any further complications from happening.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
And @@@.  Oh my goodness alright, okay.  Okay so I'll look and see, okay let's do that.  Oh so I’m going to increase 20 units, let’s do that. You only use the one and a 1/2 tablets once daily.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Right?

PATIENT X808
Well it ends up being yeah, but I'll take.

DOCTOR X808
All day long.

PATIENT X808
All day long.

DOCTOR X808
@@@.

PATIENT X808
One and a half all day long.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  We'll do that, check your sugars, check your labs, I'll do that, we'll repeat a urine sample to check @@@ and we'll check okay and we're gonna do a consult @@@.  Do you have like like hardening on your toe or anything or any like crystals in your toe?  I @@@ figure it out now.  And then we'll refer you to the Renal Clinic, Rheumatology, I'll renew the colchicine.  Do you want your um medicines mailed?

PATIENT X808
Yes.

DOCTOR X808
@@@ good.  Okay mail it uh-huh.  Then @@@.  Okay so Nephrology will contact you about the appointment.

PATIENT X808
Hmm.  So if I want to make an appointment for the Ortho and podiatrist how do I do that?  Through you or do I call?

DOCTOR X808
So I'll put a, I think you can call but I'll make sure to put a consult in.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
So they see that online okay.

PATIENT X808

DOCTOR X808
So we'll get labs done today @@@.  You're not having ulcers @@@ with your feet right?

PATIENT X808

DOCTOR X808
Okay.  Just give this to the front clerk.

PATIENT X808
Is the orthopedics on there too for my knee?

DOCTOR X808
What's going on with your knee?

PATIENT X808
I'm having problems with my right knee.  I've been saying something about for quite a while.  Right now it's like I have to, in order to sleep I have to sleep with a pillow between my knees.

DOCTOR X808
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X808
It's like right in here and here.

DOCTOR X808
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X808
It's just pain, something else right in there.

DOCTOR X808
And how long has it been going on?

PATIENT X808
It's been going on for a while.

DOCTOR X808
For months?

PATIENT X808
Yes.

DOCTOR X808
What did DOCTOR say about it?

PATIENT X808
I haven't seen him.

DOCTOR X808
You haven’t seen him for the pain.

PATIENT X808
Uh uh.

DOCTOR X808
Well it looks like the x-ray @@@ there wasn't anything extensive on the x-ray.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
It's bothering you with the pain?

PATIENT X808
Yeah the right knee.

DOCTOR X808
Do you want physical therapy?

PATIENT X808
Uh.

DOCTOR X808
Because the orthopedist will see you if there's some surgery or something that needs to be done but the right knee on the x-ray is just @@@ nothing really there.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
So it could be just mild like, you know it could just be joint pain.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Um you use your right knee to accelerate?  

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Yeah um that could be a cause of it too.

PATIENT X808
Hmm.

DOCTOR X808
Um I would stay away from ibuprofen or something.

PATIENT X808
Hmm.

DOCTOR X808
If you want Tylenol, take Tylenol for pain.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Do you want some prescribed for you?

PATIENT X808
No I can get that over-the-counter.

DOCTOR X808
So you can take Tylenol for pain.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
And see if that helps.  Um yeah.  See if that helps um I'm going to put a recall in like for a few months.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Okay if you're still having the pain and it's getting worse.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Then definitely we can figure out where to go from there okay.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
That's usually the first step.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
Okay.

PATIENT X808
Alright.

DOCTOR X808
Alright.

PATIENT X808
Thank you.

DOCTOR X808

PATIENT X808
I'll get the labs here.

DOCTOR X808
So the colchicine.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Colchicine is the actual medicine for your gout.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

You can take 0.6 mg one per day.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Along with the allopurinol.

PATIENT X808
Okay.

DOCTOR X808
And if you have a flare, as long as you've been continuing to take your allopurinol don't stop.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Just continue taking both.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
If you want to wait until your Rheumatology appointment to talk to them about starting colchicine because of the renal issues.

PATIENT X808
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X808
Then you can do that as well.

PATIENT X808
Okay.
