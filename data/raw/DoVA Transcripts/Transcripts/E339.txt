DOCTOR E339
PATIENT?  Okay, how's it going?

PATIENT E339
Okay.  I'm fine.

DOCTOR E339
The last time you came in, you had some dizziness.

PATIENT E339
Yeah.

DOCTOR E339
And they gave you two liters of fluid.

PATIENT E339
Right.

DOCTOR E339
Downstairs in the Emergency Room.

PATIENT E339
Yeah.

DOCTOR E339
How are things going now?

PATIENT E339
Pretty good, every now and then I get a little dizzy.

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E339
Sometimes I get up too much and too fast.

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E339
And then you know, almost all the medications I'm taking say could cause dizziness.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah but they just put that stuff on there, to cover their butt.  Your blood pressure is a little bit on the lower side.

PATIENT E339
Oh.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah you're pretty well set.  The quetiapine I think can cause dizziness.  Okay.  How's the Parkinson's medication going?

PATIENT E339
Alright.  I don't know how, what it's supposed to do for me you know.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah.

PATIENT E339
Sometimes I suck on my teeth, if I don't pay attention I do it you know.

DOCTOR E339
And do you have a tremor?  Did you ever have a tremor?  No.

PATIENT E339
Uh uh.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.

PATIENT E339
Never did.

DOCTOR E339
Who said you had Parkinson's?

PATIENT E339
Huh?

DOCTOR E339
Who said that you had Parkinson's?  Who diagnosed you?

PATIENT E339
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR E339
Here okay.

PATIENT E339
He said symptoms.

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh.  So then you worked with DOCTOR.  You're not feeling um dizzy or anything.

PATIENT E339
Uh uh.  Sometimes you know I’m doing too much around the house cause I'm home all day and my daughter's working, I'll cook and I'll clean and I'm mopping or vacuuming and I may get a little bit dizzy but that's it.  It's that my appetite seems really @@@.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.

PATIENT E339
But I'm 180.  In 1953 when I got out of the service I was 175, so in 50 years I gained five pounds.  I don't think that's too bad.

DOCTOR E339
@@@ significant.

PATIENT E339
I know.

DOCTOR E339
And you're not falling down with the dizziness?

PATIENT E339
No.  A couple times I tripped you know.

DOCTOR E339
Oh.

PATIENT E339
I missed that road and not paying attention.

DOCTOR E339
Right.

PATIENT E339
Cause I've been slowing down on that.

DOCTOR E339
@@@.  Anything else going on?

PATIENT E339
Nothing.

DOCTOR E339
I think I brought you in mainly to make sure that.

PATIENT E339
Huh?

DOCTOR E339
I think I brought you in mainly, we just saw you in February right?  I brought you in mainly to make sure that that dizziness had resolved.

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh, well it happens but not where it bothers me, scare me.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.  The last time was a little different?

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.  I uh I'm having a little more trouble with my prostate.

DOCTOR E339
Okay so that’s one of the questions that the VA wants us to ask you about is urination.

PATIENT E339
Yeah.

DOCTOR E339
Do you have weak urine and do you pee accidentally or anything like that?

PATIENT E339
No it's just that uh I have to go more, more frequently and that you know I have two @@@ one leads to the other so sometimes I get a little pain down there and I don't know if it's from the tube.

DOCTOR E339
What tube?

PATIENT E339
From the prostate to my bladder.

DOCTOR E339
You have a tube down there?

PATIENT E339
Yeah well you getting any blood flow here so they tapped in.

DOCTOR E339
Oh that, yeah.  No that should have nothing to do with it.

PATIENT E339
Hmm.  But I'm getting discomfort down here.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah.  Okay.  Uh how often do you urinate at night?

PATIENT E339
A day, now  a day I couldn't count it but at night at least three times in the night.

DOCTOR E339
You get up to go urinate?

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
And um are you able to completely empty your bladder?

PATIENT E339
Sometimes, not always.  I feel like uh you know I could but I get tired of standing there and give up.

DOCTOR E339
Okay so you have some problems emptying your bladder okay.

PATIENT E339
I feel like I haven't emptied it you know.

DOCTOR E339
Okay right and then when you um, what was I doing, when you do urinate is the stream weak?

PATIENT E339
It's different you know.  It'll be you know pretty good and then it'll slow down, be weak and stop and then start again.

DOCTOR E339
And how long has that been going on?

PATIENT E339
Months.  And I drink a lot of water.

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E339
And my daughters drive me nuts with Gatorade and I see in the paper and on TV Gatorade isn't all that good.  They say Pedialyte is better.

DOCTOR E339
Oh.

PATIENT E339
That they give to the kids.

DOCTOR E339
Oh Gatorade has a lot of sugar in it.

PATIENT E339
Not Gatorade 2.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.

PATIENT E339
Gatorade 2 has about 5 mg.

DOCTOR E339
Oh is that right.

PATIENT E339
The other ones are like 19 or something like that.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah it has a lot of sugar.

PATIENT E339
Yeah, yeah so I make sure.

DOCTOR E339
Good.

PATIENT E339
Gatorade 2 but then again most of the time I try to stay away from sugar and I'm constantly in that cookie bowl.  I'm worse than my grandkids.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.  Um and then you're on medication for the prostate, did you know that?

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.  Finasteride.

DOCTOR E339
Finasteride, good and you take that every day?

PATIENT E339
Yeah.  I was on two.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah you used to be on two.

PATIENT E339
And they cut the one back, uh Flomax cause they thought that was giving me the dizziness.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah, we could have probably done Flomax again.

PATIENT E339
And I think we should.

DOCTOR E339
Does that make it better?

PATIENT E339
Yeah I thought it was better with Flomax.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.  Yeah all those medications are going to cause a little bit but I'll talk to my boss about it.

PATIENT E339
I mean if.

DOCTOR E339
We could try it.

PATIENT E339
If I start taking it and I get dizzy then let’s stop, we know that was the problem.

DOCTOR E339
Right, right.  Have you ever had a prostate biopsy?

PATIENT E339
Yeah.

DOCTOR E339
Oh your symptoms.

PATIENT E339
A long time ago I had a biopsy.

DOCTOR E339
And that was negative?

PATIENT E339
There was a cut, there was a lump there and I don't know how many samples he took but I was ready to come off that table.  It was painful.

DOCTOR E339
Let's see and you're supposed to, hmm they scheduled to see the urologist.

PATIENT E339
I didn't.

DOCTOR E339
You're seeing Urology May 25th.

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
So what we could do, oh no April 2nd, you'll see Urology April 2nd.  So what we could do is try @@@ so try the Flomax again.

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
And you'll follow up with them in May and they can tell you what to do with it.

PATIENT E339
@@@.

DOCTOR E339
Okay um well let me check your blood pressure again.

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
Have a seat up there.  

PATIENT E339
Yeah.

DOCTOR E339
That's.

PATIENT E339
I just came.

DOCTOR E339
The way you walk.

PATIENT E339
Huh?

DOCTOR E339
Like this, that's called a shuffled gait.

PATIENT E339
Yeah.

DOCTOR E339
And that happens with Parkinson's.

PATIENT E339
I know.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.  Cause otherwise, usually.

PATIENT E339
Last time you know.

DOCTOR E339
You don't have a tremor.

PATIENT E339
No, no.  Seems like when I get up that's when I start.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah.

PATIENT E339
And then every day I walk outside.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah you have a little bit of cog, and then you also have this thing called, maybe you do, a little bit, not that bad.  You also have this thing called cogwheeling rigidity

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
So it's in people who have pretty bad Parkinson's and @@@ rigidity.

PATIENT E339
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR E339
Which I don't think you have but you're on medication so maybe you did before, did you do this?  I thought I felt @@@ second.  @@@ neurologist.  I think you may have a little bit of it.

PATIENT E339
And this elbow has arthritis in the morning and sometimes it @@@ me.

DOCTOR E339
Oh, do you take anything for it?

PATIENT E339
No.  I have to see the arthritis doctor sometime in the next.

DOCTOR E339
Do you take Tylenol?

PATIENT E339
Uh no.

DOCTOR E339
You can take Tylenol.

PATIENT E339
Yeah but I'm not, I'm not taking any now.

DOCTOR E339
Take some Tylenol for the pain.  I can order it for you.  You can take a gram, up to a gram a every six hours.

PATIENT E339
Yeah that would help.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah.

PATIENT E339
Especially in the morning when I wake up.

DOCTOR E339
I can order it @@@.

PATIENT E339
But sometimes it hurts when I sleep on it you know.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah.

PATIENT E339
And that makes it worse.

DOCTOR E339
@@@.

PATIENT E339
And it seems like the right elbow is always colder than the left.  Why is that?

DOCTOR E339
Um, that I don't know.  It could be um the same artery disease that you have in your legs and your heart; it could be in the arms too.

PATIENT E339
And then I was feeling pretty good, I was in Arizona for two weeks.  I come back the night before last and just as soon as I get out there it's cold.  It was 58 degrees in Las Vegas.

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E339
Cause I'm going to @@@ from there and it was 81 in Chicago.

DOCTOR E339
Isn't that funny?

PATIENT E339
It's crazy.

DOCTOR E339
It is.  I was actually, I was in @@@ and I was flying back and I had to land in Miami before I got to Chicago and it was warmer in Chicago last weekend than it was here and I was in Miami.

PATIENT E339
Yeah.

DOCTOR E339
Weird.  Now it's starting to cool down.

PATIENT E339
And I was in; I was in Portal City which is one of the warmest.  It's only 10 minutes from the Needles Point.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah.

PATIENT E339
And I couldn't believe the temperature drop and my daughter yes its fine @@@.  As soon as I get there it drops.

DOCTOR E339
@@@.

PATIENT E339
Oh.

DOCTOR E339
Alright.  Okay and then relax your arm as much as you can, try to bend your elbow, just like that, perfect.  You're blood pressure is hard to feel.

PATIENT E339
Hmm.  That arm is always lower than this arm.  Why I don't know.  I think there's some blockage the doctor said.

DOCTOR E339
I'll try that arm.

PATIENT E339
What was it?

DOCTOR E339
That's 150 too.  Yeah there was a big difference.

PATIENT E339
Yeah.

DOCTOR E339
So it was 108/68 on this side and I couldn't even hear it on that side.

PATIENT E339
Yeah they tell me there's a blockage.

DOCTOR E339
@@@.

PATIENT E339
When I had my heart attack, why didn't I tell them and I said how could I tell you cause I didn't know.  @@@.

DOCTOR E339
And which arm is cold?

PATIENT E339
It's the elbow.

DOCTOR E339
Oh the elbow's cold, but this arm is okay.  Hmm.  There you go.  Yeah it's easier to feel a pulse on this side.

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
You must have a blockage in that arm.

PATIENT E339
That's what he said but.

DOCTOR E339
I don't think there's any, @@@ this means, pink means blood flow.  But that doesn't that needs to be done, it's something to watch.  Did you used to be a drinker?

PATIENT E339
Used to be.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.

PATIENT E339
I quit 32 years ago February 19th.

DOCTOR E339
Wow, @@@ huh.  Keep standing up.  Okay, just watch out, if you ever notice this arm getting cool or something?

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
That means there may be you know a really bad blockage in here, maybe permanent blockage that we have to intervene on and if it gets cool you go straight to the hospital okay.

PATIENT E339
@@@.

DOCTOR E339
Any numbness or tingling or anything like that in the arms go straight to the hospital and tell them that you know.

PATIENT E339
Yeah the blockage.

DOCTOR E339
That you may have a blockage in this arm.  And they'll be able to feel the pulses are not equal.

PATIENT E339
The same with that shuffling thing.

DOCTOR E339
You can stand up.

PATIENT E339
When I first get up that happens.

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E339
To walk.

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh, yeah.

PATIENT E339
I'll get my cane, I go outside and I start walking normal, no shuffle and it seems like it only happens when I get up or when I have back pain.

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh back pain can cause it.

PATIENT E339
Yeah.  Most of the time it's the back pain.

DOCTOR E339
Do you have any or are you feeling dizzy right now?

PATIENT E339
No.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.  Take some deep breaths in and out for me.  Good.  Okay let’s take your blood pressure standing up.  Let's stand over here and then turn around.  This will be easier.  I think I'll get you to take this off, I think you can take it off.  Alright, oops.  @@@.  Okay, the same @@@.

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
Now the other one.  @@@.

PATIENT E339
@@@ huh.

DOCTOR E339
There we go.  Okay and lean forward, there you go.  Okay, so it's 94/68 in this arm here.  So the blood pressure dropped.

PATIENT E339
Yeah I know it dropped.

DOCTOR E339
And that seems like @@@.

PATIENT E339
And this thing with the drinking when I first come home, I was a wreck.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah.

PATIENT E339
And I came here and they did like almost a family doctor.

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E339
They put me on phenobarbital.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah.

PATIENT E339
And another pill and I @@@.   So I noticed that when I took the a couple of drinks that it relaxed me.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah.

PATIENT E339
And from relaxing me it damn near killed me.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah.

PATIENT E339
So I had to give that up.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.  So @@@ about that.

PATIENT E339
Pardon?

DOCTOR E339
I'm going to talk to my boss about what he thinks about starting on the tamsulosin and making sure that's okay.

PATIENT E339
Yes.

DOCTOR E339
I'm willing to try it uh and I do want you to watch your blood pressures.  And then we may bring you back in to see the nurse to check your blood pressures again.  Do you live far away?

PATIENT E339
20 minutes.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.  Let me go talk to my boss, what were you saying?

PATIENT E339
Uh so I start taking today or tomorrow or?

DOCTOR E339
Well let me ask and he may say that.

PATIENT E339
Okay.

DOCTOR E339
I just have to run this by him; he may say I can't do that.

PATIENT E339
And it was just one tablet.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah, take one cause it's the same dose every time.  I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  86:40  DOCTOR IN:  94:10)

DOCTOR E339
Okay, so the boss is okay with starting the Flomax and I'll order that for you.  And we need just need to be diligent because it lowers your blood pressure you know.

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
Yeah so that's why we stopped it before right?

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
So be careful.

PATIENT E339
@@@.

DOCTOR E339
Right and we thought you were getting dizzy because.

PATIENT E339
Flomax.

DOCTOR E339
Flomax lowers blood pressure.  If your blood pressure's low you'll feel dizzy.

PATIENT E339
And Tylenol and Flomax.

DOCTOR E339
Tylenol yeah.  So do you want me to send them both to your house?

PATIENT E339
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
We'll give you the higher strength of the Tylenol.

PATIENT E339
Okay.

DOCTOR E339
Um.

PATIENT E339
Sometimes with that back pain.

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E339
I take four pills of hydrocortisone is it?

DOCTOR E339
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E339
And sometimes I'll take a half a pill and then go for a walk and I have no trouble you know.  It relieves that pain in the back cause that causes me to walk funny.

DOCTOR E339
Okay and Flomax you're supposed to take it every night right.

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.  I just yeah.

DOCTOR E339
And it's pretty @@@ blood pressure medications but it still can.

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
If you feel dizzy at all with it, stop it okay and you can come see our nurse in two weeks to get the blood pressure checked and make sure that it's not lowering your blood pressure.

PATIENT E339
Will they send me a letter?

DOCTOR E339
Yeah we'll set it up today, you can schedule it before you leave and then you're going to see Urology as scheduled in April, you know about that appointment right?

PATIENT E339

DOCTOR E339
You can see me in six months.  Okay.  Okay, I think that's all we need.  Oh, no, no, no and then there's one more thing.  I need you to go to Vascular Lab.  This asymmetry thing, he said we got to look into that.

PATIENT E339
The what?

DOCTOR E339
Oh the fact that your blood pressures are different on the different sides.

PATIENT E339
Oh yeah, both sides, yeah.

DOCTOR E339
We got to look into it okay.

PATIENT E339
Okay.

DOCTOR E339
For that, the Vascular Lab will take care of it.  It's like just an ultrasound, it doesn't hurt.

PATIENT E339
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E339
And um they'll call you and schedule it.

PATIENT E339
Okay.  I was wondering when they did that bypass here they didn't feel that.

DOCTOR E339
Probably did yeah.

PATIENT E339
And I'm quite sure they took it.

DOCTOR E339
At the arm?

PATIENT E339
Knew there was a difference.

DOCTOR E339
Oh the blood pressures yeah.

PATIENT E339
Yeah.

DOCTOR E339
Okay, so I'm just going to add that in as a consult so they'll call you okay.

PATIENT E339
They'll call me and I'm good at forgetting.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.  And you're not having symptoms with that.  When you use your arms, it sounds like you said your right elbow sometimes feels cold.

PATIENT E339
Feels, cold, yeah.

DOCTOR E339
But otherwise nothing?

PATIENT E339
Uh uh.  @@@ no.

DOCTOR E339

Fevers or chills?

PATIENT E339
No.

DOCTOR E339
Okay.  Okay.  Okay, that is it.

PATIENT E339

PATIENT E339
And give this to them.

DOCTOR E339
And schedule the nurse visit.

PATIENT E339
Okay.

DOCTOR E339
And they'll do this, you just have to show them the paper and then they'll put in an order, they won't schedule this one today but they'll put it in the computer and will send an automatic message.
