DOCTOR N641

PATIENT N641
Right here.  So how you doing?

DOCTOR N641
Doing well.

PATIENT N641
Thank you.  Appreciate it.

DOCTOR N641
I am doing well.  On the right side, here. @@@

PATIENT N641
@@@.  

DOCTOR N641
I am taking over for DOCTOR.  I know you saw in the past.

PATIENT N641
Okay.

DOCTOR N641
DOCTOR still here.

PATIENT N641
Okay.

DOCTOR N641
So what brings you here today?

PATIENT N641
Huh?

DOCTOR N641
What brings you here today?

PATIENT N641
Oh yes, I need an appointment to see a foot doctor and uh, let me see if I can get some Viagra.

DOCTOR N641
Okay.

PATIENT N641
And I was scheduled for @@@ but when I didn’t @@@, do I need a, uh, @@@ when you get up to 50 years old?

DOCTOR N641
Colonoscopy?

PATIENT N641
Colonoscopy,  @@@ yeah.  @@@.  Yeah, colonoscopy.  I think I had one before.

DOCTOR N641
Okay.

PATIENT N641
But I think I need another one.

DOCTOR N641
They said one in 2007.  That was the last time.  Let’s see what they said.

PATIENT N641
Okay.

DOCTOR N641
In 2007 they found that everything looks normal.  You had biopsies taken.  There were diverticula which are like outpouches in the wall of the colon.  Um, everything was normal.  They did take biopsies.  Let me look at the results.  Um, let’s see what else they did.  Upper GI.  So, let’s see what the results showed.  You had a catheterization done after that.

PATIENT N641
Um hmm.

DOCTOR N641
And chronic diarrhea.  Is your diarrhea better?

PATIENT N641
It is about the same.

DOCTOR N641
About the same, okay.  So the biopsies were actually normal.  Okay.  So you had a return appointment, okay, so then what did they say about the biopsies.  So with this chronic diarrhea, work up was negative.  Stool cards were negative.  So they said followup in GI Clinic.  Are you losing weight?

PATIENT N641
Ah no.

DOCTOR N641
Okay.

PATIENT N641
I have gained weight in fact.  @@@.  

DOCTOR N641
Okay.  Good.  Um, so it looks like all the stool studies were negative.  So what did they decide to do?  Did they say?

PATIENT N641
No, they didn’t say.

DOCTOR N641
Okay.  So I don’t think we need to repeat colonoscopy.  You had it in 2007.  So you really don’t need one for another couple of years.

PATIENT N641
Okay, so you have it every seven years or something like that?

DOCTOR N641
You have it every ten years unless there’s reasons to get it earlier.  If you had, like abnormalities, you know maybe if you have like polyps, if you have abnormal pathology then they would want to see you sooner.

PATIENT N641
Okay.

DOCTOR N641
But from the way it looks like they didn’t comment that they want to see you done sooner.  Let me see if in the notes if they actually want to @@@.  Any other questions?

PATIENT N641
Uh no.  @@@ about colonoscopy?  @@@.  Should I have another one?

DOCTOR N641
When should you have another one?  Since everything looked okay I think, the biopsies were normal, I think you probably should have one about 2017.  

PATIENT N641
17?  That long?

DOCTOR N641
Um hm.

PATIENT N641
Okay.  Alright.  Other than that, my foot hurts, that started back in 2008 or 2007.

DOCTOR N641
For your foot?

PATIENT N641
Uh huh.

DOCTOR N641
What was wrong with the foot?

PATIENT N641
They said they might have to operate on my right foot, @@@ stairs, and I never came back, where I was living had stairs so I never did return.

DOCTOR N641
Okay.  So let’s see.  You had an appointment back in 2007.  Let’s see.  Oh I see you had the bony, the @@@.

PATIENT N641
The @@@.

DOCTOR N641
From the joints, right.  Like a little bony @@@.

PATIENT N641
Right.

DOCTOR N641
Okay.  And they said, did they want to do something about it?

PATIENT N641
They wanted to before it gets worse, but they told me I couldn’t climb the stairs, no, after the operation.  So I said I can’t do that so I was just wondering.  It starts back hurting worse so that is why I asked you about it.

DOCTOR N641
Okay.  Alright.  Yeah then we can definitely send you back to the clinic.  Let me put in another request.

PATIENT N641
Okay.

DOCTOR N641
Any other complaints?

PATIENT N641

DOCTOR N641

DOCTOR N641

PATIENT N641
Okay.  Okay. That sounds good.

DOCTOR N641
And then when was the last time you had blood work done?

PATIENT N641
Ah, this year.  I don’t @@@.

DOCTOR N641
I will take a look and @@@ the only thing I would be concerned about is because we have you on medications.  Sometimes it affects the kidneys and also sometimes it affects your electrolytes.  So we should check that.

PATIENT N641
Okay. Okay.  I got, my ibuprofen I got one left.  I got one left of that. 

DOCTOR N641
One?  How long have you been taking that?

PATIENT N641
Ah I take them, hmm, well I got pain but I don’t take them every day, you know.  Only when I have pain I take it.

DOCTOR N641
Because that can also affect your kidneys, just so you know.

PATIENT N641
I don’t take them regular.

DOCTOR N641
You don’t want to take them too often, too frequently.

PATIENT N641
Okay.  I don’t. @@@ I know I got more refills left so I just wanted @@@.

DOCTOR N641
Okay. I can refill it. But let’s check your blood work first.  You don’t want your kidneys to go bad because of ibuprofen or anything.

PATIENT N641
Hm hmm.  Okay.  Thank you.

DOCTOR N641
Any other questions?

PATIENT N641
Ah no.  

DOCTOR N641

The order is in so you can get the left foot x-rayed.  

PATIENT N641
Okay.

DOCTOR N641
Then we will get some blood work just to make sure, we can take a look at your kidneys.  You know when you are on the ibuprofen, and you’re also taking the hydrochlorothiazide, that can affect your kidneys.

PATIENT N641
Okay.

DOCTOR N641
Want to make sure that that looks okay.  The last time,your kidney function, I will tell you what that looked like.  Let’s see your kidney function looks okay.  The creatinine was 1.2.  That is what I am looking at.  The kidney function.  It looks like everything else looked okay.  Your sodium level is a little bit low but I think the hydrochlorothiazide can actually cause that @@@.  Um, and your blood count looked okay.

DOCTOR N641
No.  That’s fine.

PATIENT N641
Okay.  Can I ask you a question?

DOCTOR N641
Yeah.

PATIENT N641
I want, I mean, I @@@ mucous lately for a while now.  I wonder why?  I mean, I thought it was a cold but I can’t have a cold for that long period of time, so what would cause a person to keep on spitting all the time? You know?

DOCTOR N641
Spitting?

PATIENT N641
Yeah.

DOCTOR N641
Has long has it been like that?

PATIENT N641
