SECOND PERSON Z792
I brought all his medications along.  Some of them he’s out of.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
And I brought a list of what he's taking now.  This is all that he's taking now and just brought them along and some these, that one he's out of completely and some of them have to be ordered separate.

DOCTOR Z792
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON Z792
I put in separate. There's two of them that were added uh.  The one @@@. 

DOCTOR Z792

SECOND PERSON Z792
No, this is what we got and what we can get with other doctor and yeah these are all that he had before.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
And they took the packing out and that was the medicine she gave for the @@@.

DOCTOR Z792
Is it @@@.

PATIENT Z792
@@@.

SECOND PERSON Z792
The ones is an antibiotic, he is finished with that and the other one - this doctor, this doctor in the hospital added that because his blood pressure was so high.

DOCTOR Z792
@@@.

SECOND PERSON Z792
So he added that, so that’s not in the system, I don't know if you want him to keep taking.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah, I see it here.  Amlodipine.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z792
Do you now what dose?  Is he on a different dose?

SECOND PERSON Z792
I've got the medicine with me.

DOCTOR Z792
Uh let's see.  This is 5 mg.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Cause he takes another one at noon time a different one.  But when he gets the bloody nose his blood pressure went way up, it may have well been because of the stress he was under. It was over 200.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Anyway.  @@@.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
These are @@@.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.  And it was just filled on the 4th.

SECOND PERSON Z792
That was filled when he was.

DOCTOR Z792
Uh he was only given enough for one month?  No refills.  Just  for 30 days.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay, alright.  Your blood pressure's pretty good today.  Have you felt dizzy at all since this one was increased?

PATIENT Z792
Which one?

DOCTOR Z792
Since your blood pressure, one of your blood pressure pills was increased last week.

PATIENT Z792
It was increased?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah it was increased when he was in the hospital.

DOCTOR Z792
Right.  Do you feel a little.  How do you feel with the higher dose?  Do you feel okay with this new medication?

PATIENT Z792
I don't know about any new medication.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah you got those when you were in the hospital.  When you were in the hospital for the nose.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah because the blood pressure was up to 200 and something.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah.  I'll check it here so that he keeps getting the higher dose at home so; he's up to the 10 here @@@.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.

DOCTOR Z792
Alright.  Any other medication changes other than that one?

SECOND PERSON Z792
No just the one, it's generic for, it's a medicine for allergies – the generic.  That's this medicine @@@.

PATIENT Z792

DOCTOR Z792
Oh @@@.  Okay, yeah he has @@@.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Now that's what the Ear, Nose and Throat gave him.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Then, he has a follow-up. I follow-up appointment to see how its going.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay alright.  And he's still on Synthroid.  How's your heartburn?

PATIENT Z792
Pardon?

DOCTOR Z792

SECOND PERSON Z792
He hasn’t been taking that one.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.  Any chest pain?

PATIENT Z792
No.

DOCTOR Z792
No palpitations?  Do you ever feel a flutter in your chest?

PATIENT Z792
Yes I do have uh.

SECOND PERSON Z792
He has atrial fibrillation but you don't feel it right?

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah.

PATIENT Z792
Pardon?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Irregular heartbeat, you don't feel that do you?

PATIENT Z792
No what I do have is, on the record.

SECOND PERSON Z792
The atrial fibrillation.

DOCTOR Z792
The atrial fibrillation yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z792
We know about it.  We know about your arrhythmia, but do you notice it?  Do you notice it?  Do you notice anything?

PATIENT Z792
I'm not sure where we're at.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Well when you have the irregular heartbeat, do you notice it at all?  Is it any different for you?

PATIENT Z792
You're calling it by some other name than I've heard before.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Atrial fibrillation.

PATIENT Z792
Huh?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Atrial fibrillation.

PATIENT Z792
Right atrial fibrillation okay, now I understand.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah.

PATIENT Z792
But I've never felt anything with that.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

PATIENT Z792
With that in mind.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay that's good, okay.  Alright any coughing or coughing up sputum?

PATIENT Z792
No.

DOCTOR Z792
No coughing?

PATIENT Z792
No.

DOCTOR Z792
No, okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
He'd only had that pneumonia when he went into the hospital.  @@@ when he was in there you they noticed that he went into atrial fibrillation so the doctor said  - took a heart test.

DOCTOR Z792
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Which he had where they went in through the groin.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z792
That test and a couple days later he was in terrible, terrible pain in his groin.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
And then he started bleeding.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
I'm sure it was coming from that.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah what did they do for him?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Well they put him, they took him down and they found that he was bleeding.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
And so they gave him four units of blood.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@ in his record.  He had four units of blood.

DOCTOR Z792
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON Z792
And um, and that's about all and then they released him to therapy another week later and released him to Fairview Veterans Home.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.  So when did he come back from Fairview?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Uh the, I think it was the 11th of December.

PATIENT Z792
I came home, I was released.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z792
So he bled, he needed four units of blood before he went to Fairview.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Right.

DOCTOR Z792
Then he came home and you guys saw DOCTOR and she checked his blood count.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yes.

DOCTOR Z792
So his blood count was low compared to where it had been in the past?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Wasn't it 9 something?

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah that's what it is here I got.  I also have a report just from um.

DOCTOR Z792
So maybe, so you had some that were in the 9s and then one of them was up to close to 13 and then back down to 9.7 again and so.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@.

DOCTOR Z792
Well.

SECOND PERSON Z792
How come it goes.

DOCTOR Z792
This one doesn't really need, I mean all of the other were in the same range @@@ than that one but as you can see that maybe a year and a half ago he was up to 11 and 12.  

SECOND PERSON Z792
He was at 11 when he went into the hospital.

DOCTPR Z792
Okay. 

SECOND PERSON Z792
The records shows 11 something when he went into the hospital.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah well we can recheck his blood count today to make sure that it's stable.  Have you had any blood in your stool?

PATIENT Z792
They just gave me three tests.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah you haven't had those, brought those in yet.

PATIENT Z792
Yeah I haven't turned them in yet.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@ he had to finish the dialysis.

PATIENT Z792
But they're all completed ready to turn in.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay from the Dialysis Lab okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
They're going to look at him too.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z792
So we could have them sent here.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah, could you do that?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yes.

DOCTOR Z792
To DOCTOR?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yes.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay and then the other thing is, you know, how long have you been on dialysis?

PATIENT Z792
Oh long time.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Seven years @@@.

DOCTOR Z792
Seven years.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Seven, seven and half years.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.  So you know anywhere between 10 and 12, really is an okay hemoglobin.  Patients who are on dialysis are anemic because they are, you know you have to take a replacement with dialysis and your kidneys help you keep your blood @@@.

SECOND PERSON Z792
But he feels so weak.

DOCTOR Z792
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON Z792
He still has a hard time standing up cause he's weak and I wondered if that groin has healed, if it’s healed because while he's been home.  He's been home since.

PATIENT Z792
The 11th.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@ the 11th of December and still has a real hard time standing up because of the severe weakness and I just wondered if that’s healed.

PATIENT Z792
I'm not making any progress.

SECOND PERSON Z792
He just doesn't seem to be getting better.  He's still real weak.

DOCTOR Z792
Uh-huh.  Is he still getting any rehab?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yes, he gets Home Health.

DOCTOR Z792
Home rehab.  

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah home rehab.

DOCTOR Z792
How many times a week?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Twice.

DOCTOR Z792
Twice a week okay and then what is his activity level in between the rehab program?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Uh he does the exercises; he has weights and will lift the weights.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
And he also uh, he walks.  He walks our condo has the hallways and he walks there.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
And we went once, last Saturday, we went to the @@@.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@ we @@@ had rail.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
But he just doesn't seem to be getting his strength back and it's really tough.

DOCTOR Z792
You know it takes some time and then on top of that would be the anemia.  I don't know where his counts are now but being anemic makes you feel weak or makes you weak.  You know when you're anemic and having all the previous medical problems that he's had and then you know being so deconditioned where he needed the rehab all of that kind of combines.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z792
And it just takes a long time to get better.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@.

DOCTOR Z792
But um, when was the last time that he saw DOCTOR the hematologist?

PATIENT Z792
Uh.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Not too long ago before that, probably September or October.  It was shortly before.

PATIENT Z792
I haven't seen him since I left the.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Not since he's been sick.

PATIENT Z792
Since I went to.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay this is right after he got out of the hospital and that's from the – they did at where he gets dialysis.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
For the dialysis.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@.

PATIENT Z792
That's before I went to.

SECOND PERSON Z792
That's before you went to .

PATIENT Z792
Before I @@@ into uh.

SECOND PERSON Z792
No that was after you came home, like the 12th or 13th, you came home on the 11th and you had dialysis the next day I think.  @@@ but they do it once a month.

DOCTOR Z792
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z792
Well I thought I left since I went into.

SECOND PERSON Z792
To Fairview.

PATIENT Z792
No, well certainly before I went into Fairview but before going to see, two weeks.

SECOND PERSON Z792
And that's before you went to the hospital.

PATIENT Z792
Yeah I saw that.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Which one?

PATIENT Z792
Good Samaritan Hospital.

DOCTOR Z792
Hmm okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
That's another thing, concerned, because he had such bad bloody noses and then he had the breathing problem.  He has a breathing problem.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Is there any indication of?

DOCTOR Z792
No not, he hasn't had any bleeding recently correct?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Last week.

DOCTOR Z792
Right.  But outside of that, after he saw the ENT, the nose surgeon.

SECOND PERSON Z792
No that's right.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah.  So you know once he follows with them, as long as you know he's not still bleeding from that same point and then um his anemia is most likely from his kidney disease @@@ labs.  (phone rings, doctor answers)  Okay.  I'm just going to do a quick exam here.  

SECOND PERSON Z792
Is there anything they can do to build up his blood?

DOCTOR Z792
Um.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Cause his iron is lower than 2.

DOCTOR Z792
So the kidney doctors sometimes recommend for IV iron infusion but um and DOCTOR is a blood doctor too.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Oh too.

DOCTOR Z792
So I think.

SECOND PERSON Z792
So I should try to get another appointment with him?

DOCTOR Z792
I think so.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah.  Or even with the kidney docs to ask them if they think the IV, getting iron through them.  Because right now, is he on an iron supplement?

SECOND PERSON Z792
No. @@@

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah so um you know we need to know that the bleeding isn't coming from the rectum and that he's not bleeding internally because you don’t want to just treat someone with iron if the blood might be going somewhere else.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Right.

DOCTOR Z792
But that’s why we need to know what his counts are to make sure that they're stable.  But if it's stable, if everything is stable and it looks like you know he's anemic because he is chronically ill and on hemodialysis then you know IV iron could be you know an option other than the iron tablets.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@ so he never has gone back up since before he went to the hospital.

DOCTOR Z792
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON Z792
And he was given blood; it never went all the way back up.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah, right.  That's why, so if you look at the trends of his hemoglobin, I can show you here.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Going back and forth.

DOCTOR Z792
It's kind of back and forth.  Over the last you know year and a half or so, but even maybe a year ago he was still in the 9s.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Oh.

DOCTOR Z792
So even though he's 9.7, that's not different from where he was almost a year ago in March of last year he was 9.6.  The big question is here from you know June of 09 to then September of 09, when he went from 12 to about the 9 in March 2010.  But since March of 2010 @@@ he's been in the same range as he is now.  This out liner here.

SECOND PERSON Z792
It just used to be that he can't get his strength back @@@.

DOCTOR Z792
You’re correct, yeah.  @@@ can really be hard.  But being a kidney patient, being a dialysis patient, you don't really shoot for high goals like that for that, 12, 13 because you have the understanding that he's a kidney patient.

SECOND PATIENT Z792
And that controls everything.

DOCTOR Z792
Uh-huh.  So you know that's a good question that you have but you know some oral iron supplements or IV iron infusion you know twice a week or something like that could help with his anemia.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@ we’ll get an appointment with DOCTOR.

DOCTOR Z792
Uh-huh.  Yep, okay.  Can you lean forward?

PATIENT Z792
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay great.  Deep breath.  Okay deep breath.  Okay.  Okay.  Alright.  A little bit of swelling here.  Let's see this one.  

SECOND PERSON Z792
The other one really @@@.

DOCTOR Z792
When was his dialysis?  The last dialysis?

SECOND PERSON Z792
Monday.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.  Alright, his blood pressure is okay.  How much fluid did they pull off?  Do you know?  How much fluid?

PATIENT Z792
No I don't know.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay, that's okay.  Alright.

SECOND PERSON Z792
@@@ certain weight and get him down to that certain weight.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.  

SECOND PERSON Z792
So and this is also, yeah this is new too, yeah that is new and this @@@ is new.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
That happened at ear nose and throat.

DOCTOR Z792
So that's on there.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yes.

PATIENT Z792
I’m way in and way out.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay now the one thing, the other question I do have, if you look at, if you go back, I'll need those back.

DOCTOR Z792
Yep I'm going to bring those right back to you.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Um when you look at here, his cholesterol is 98. And he’s on statin drugs. Does he really need that many drugs @@@.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah for his total cholesterol. @@@ I'm @@@; I'm not going to make too many changes without DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Z792
So I'm not going to change that medication.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.

PATIENT Z792
I never really talked to DOCTOR.  I don’t believe.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah you had one visit with him.  @@@.

PATIENT Z792
I think we got a telephone call from him.

SECOND PERSON Z792
No we met with him.  We met once with him.  I don't think, why take so many statin drugs if you don't need them you know.

DOCTOR Z792
Um but with his history you know just for protection to have those on board.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.

DOCTOR Z792
@@@.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Maybe @@@ going on.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Could be enough.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah I'll um, just keep taking them as you are and then I'll send DOCTOR a note to say that you guys want to decrease  your dose.  Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z792
I'll be back shortly.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  58:11  DOCTOR IN:  68:59)

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.  Alright.  So we're all done here for the day.  I'm going to have.

SECOND PERSON Z792
He needs some more refills on these four.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay do you want 90 days or 30?  Let's just do the 90 and that'll last you for a while.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.

DOCTOR Z792
So this is your list, here's the new list.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.

DOCTOR Z792
This is the amlodipine 10 mg.  This came up at 5, because I hadn't signed the order.  I’m going to sign the order then it'll be changed.  All of this I'll give you 90 days on everything.  So like these refills, @@@ ignore those, I’ll give you 90 days for everything and they'll be mailed to your house.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.  Now there's one, I don't know if it’s serious or not.  But there's one @@@ except for this one we are out of it.  Will he be okay without that for a few days?

DOCTOR Z792
Do you want to pick it up today?

SECOND PERSON Z792
He really should have it right?

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Cause that's the one that @@@.

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah, the kidneys okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Well then let's get it.

DOCTOR Z792
Pick that up from the Pharmacy today okay.

PATIENT Z792
Do they close at a certain time?

DOCTOR Z792
Yeah that's why um we need you guys heading down there.  So I'll renew everything but that one I'll say that you can pick it up today.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Okay.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.  Do you need help putting this away?

SECOND PERSON Z792
No I'll put it in my bag here so I would.

DOCTOR Z792
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Z792
So I could carry it.

PATIENT Z792
You got to get those four separated now.

SECOND PERSON Z792
Yeah I'll put those away.  But it's okay because she's ordering it.

PATIENT Z792

SECOND PERSON Z792

DOCTOR Z792
Okay so this one you can pick up right now from the Pharmacy.
