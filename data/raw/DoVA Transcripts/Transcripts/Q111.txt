PATIENT Q111
Uh in the arms.

DOCTOR Q111
In the arms?

PATIENT Q111
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q111
How so?

PATIENT Q111
Maybe I couldn't even move this one up the other day.  I could just move it up like this and it will start hurting.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
Then I have to grab it and the muscle pushes back down.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
Same thing with this arm and this rash, I don't know what, it just happened.  I don't know what that is.

DOCTOR Q111
@@@.

PATIENT Q111
This came out of nowhere man.

DOCTOR Q111
What are you talking about?  

PATIENT Q111
What is that?

DOCTOR Q111
Oh this right here?

PATIENT Q111
Yeah.  

DOCTOR Q111
It looks like just dry skin to me.  Does it itch?


PATIENT Q111
No.  I've never itched it.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.  Um this to me um seems like the summertime okay.

PATIENT Q111
I don't know.

DOCTOR Q111
I would just put some lotion on it.  Let me see your other elbow.

PATIENT Q111
This is not like that.

DOCTOR Q111
This one's not as bad um.  I would start with some lotion or like uh, do you use Vaseline or anything?

PATIENT Q111
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR Q111
Yeah start with that and if it gets worse um I want to see it but right now it looks okay.

PATIENT Q111
You know I have never been tested for diabetes or cancer here.

DOCTOR Q111
Or cancer so uh.

PATIENT Q111
I've never been tested.

DOCTOR Q111
Right so we'll get to that.  Um do you have any feelings of hurting yourself?

PATIENT Q111
Uh not hurting myself but hurting other people sometimes.

DOCTOR Q111
When is that?

PATIENT Q111
Oh that's been happening this week, I mean this year.

DOCTOR Q111
Alright.

PATIENT Q111
Period. I get frustrated man, I get frustrated.  I'm not listening good to other people.  They're like @@@.  My feelings is very short.

DOCTOR Q111
Alright.  Um so a couple of things going on here.  First off uh you sound depressed to me okay.  You sound very depressed.  You have, we have uh kind of an eight point screening test for depression um and usually you're positive on 2-3 of them um that's when we consider someone to be likely depressed um.  You're currently positive on six of them so you know it sounds like you're dealing with some depression right now.  Can you think of any reason you would be depressed?

PATIENT Q111
Well my mother and father, they was in the hospital not too long ago and I been dealing with that, I don't know.  I know and so were all my other brothers.  They have families and I was dealing with this by myself.

DOCTOR Q111
Uh-huh.  Do either of your parents live with you?

PATIENT Q111
They, both of them does.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
Yeah both of them are sick.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
One has Parkinson's and cancer and my mother's sick.  She has depression.  She gets bouts of depression.

DOCTOR Q111
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q111
She's taking Xanax, Zoloft and all this stuff and it's making me that way too man.  I know I can't deal with it all, I don't know what to do.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.  I can definitely understand your frustration with that situation.  It sounds like you've got quite a bit on your plate right now.

PATIENT Q111
Right, right.

DOCTOR Q111
Uh the other thing that you mentioned, the black stools.

PATIENT Q111
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q111
Um so when people have black stools the thing we would be concerned about is that you're possibly bleeding somewhere in your GI tract.

PATIENT Q111
@@@.

DOCTOR Q111
Now if uh, if it resolved then you're probably not bleeding anymore.

PATIENT Q111
No.

DOCTOR Q111
Uh and it doesn't, just because they were black doesn't mean that you were bleeding um.  The other thing that can sometimes make your stool black is Pepto Bismol if you take the medication.  If you're taking Pepto Bismol it'll also be black or iron supplements but I don't think you're taking that.

PATIENT Q111
The only thing I did, I took some of my mother's omeprazole.

DOCTOR Q111
Omeprazole?

PATIENT Q111
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.  I thought you were already on omeprazole?

PATIENT Q111
Iâ€™m out of everything.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay so first off we can refill that for sure um but no, omeprazole shouldn't make your stool black.

PATIENT Q111
Right.

DOCTOR Q111
Uh.

PATIENT Q111
That was for the pain I was having all day, around the chest heart area, through the stomach area, a pain, just pain that come out of nowhere.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.  Uh if you're having pain in your chest, you know you may want to consider going to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT Q111
That's what the lady told me already.

DOCTOR Q111
Right but you didn't go to the Emergency Room?

PATIENT Q111
I have two elderly people to uh.

DOCTOR Q111
Right, alright.

PATIENT Q111
Take care of.

DOCTOR Q111
I can understand that um.  The main concern though is if you have a heart attack you know it doesn't matter who you have to take care of cause you're not gonna be there anymore.  Well the other that you bring up is uh screening tests for cancer and diabetes um.  You are correct; uh you know I don't think we've ever screened you for diabetes um. Previously there really wasn't any indication for you to be screened for diabetes.  You know you weren't that heavy and you seemed like you were doing well um.  In light of your recent weight gain um you know sometimes that can be related.  I would like to screen you for diabetes um.  The other thing we need to check is your lipids, your cholesterol needs to be rechecked um because we haven't checked them in a while.  Um and then as far as cancer screening uh there's only really two cancers that we screen for, um, because when you screen for cancer it has to be common to pick anything up and it has to be deadly.

PATIENT Q111
Oh.

DOCTOR Q111
So things that we're concerned about are prostate cancer and colon cancer.

PATIENT Q111
Okay colon cancer.

DOCTOR Q111
Colon cancer, you had the colonoscopy so you'll be and you did um some polyps on there, um.  It was done in 2009 so you'll need a repeat in 2014.

PATIENT Q111
Right.

DOCTOR Q111
You might need one five years after that because of the polyps.

PATIENT Q111
So what happens with the repeat?

DOCTOR Q111
When you have polyps?

PATIENT Q111
I had two of them that were pre-cancer they told me.

DOCTOR Q111
Right.  So the uh your polyps, there's a bunch of different kinds of polyps um.  Your polyps were the less scary kind so they very infrequently turn into cancer.

PATIENT Q111
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Q111
So we want you to, normally people get screened every ten years.  You had polyps so they want to screen you every five.

PATIENT Q111
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q111
Uh polyps take a while to turn into cancer.  It's not like you're gonna get one today and a month from now it's gonna be cancer.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

DOCTOR Q111
So if there were only two then, screening you again in five years there may be more polyps but it's unlikely that there would be an actual cancer.

PATIENT Q111
Oh.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
Alright.

DOCTOR Q111
Um the other thing, prostate cancer um.  Prostate cancer is very common but it's usually not very deadly.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

DOCTOR Q111
Um do you have difficulty urinating?

PATIENT Q111
No, @@@.

DOCTOR Q111
Now can you sleep through the night without getting up to go to the bathroom?

PATIENT Q111
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.  So in someone who doesn't have any symptoms and do you have a family history of prostate cancer?

PATIENT Q111
Uh my father had testicular cancer.

DOCTOR Q111
Testicular cancer?

PATIENT Q111
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.  Uh when did your dad develop testicular cancer?

PATIENT Q111
Oo uh two years ago.  Uh he's cancer free as they say right now.

DOCTOR Q111
Excellent, excellent.  Do you know how to check yourself for testicular cancer?

PATIENT Q111
No.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay all you need to do is feel your testicles and if you feel any hard bumps that's what we'd be concerned about.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

DOCTOR Q111
So a bump like a pea, if it felt like a pea and it'll be hard.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

DOCTOR Q111
That's when you would want to see someone.

PATIENT Q111
Oh.

DOCTOR Q111
Uh if you're not having any symptoms and you're not, there's no family history of prostate cancer um the screening test that we have sometimes causes as much problems as they do good because if the screening test is positive then we're gonna want to do a biopsy.  Um biopsies can cause erectile dysfunction.

PATIENT Q111
Oh.

DOCTOR Q111
Incontinence, so my recommendation would be that you don't get screened.

PATIENT Q111
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.  If you want to be screened that's fine but uh I don't think it's a good idea.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
Alright.

DOCTOR Q111
Alright.  We have a lot of things to address today.  Um I'm gonna go talk to DOCTOR.  Do you have more questions?

PATIENT Q111
No just the medicines.  The omeprazole.

DOCTOR Q111
Yeah.

PATIENT Q111
@@@.

DOCTOR Q111
You have all the stuff you need refilled.

PATIENT Q111
So I can pick it up, thatâ€™s why I brought the bag.

DOCTOR Q111
Sure.  Okay.

PATIENT Q111
Alright.

DOCTOR Q111
Let me go talk to DOCTOR, I'll be right back.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  41:36  DOCTOR IN:  48:20)

DOCTOR Q111
Alright.  So let's go one by one and get these things taken care of.

PATIENT Q111
Alright.

DOCTOR Q111
So first off um based on the symptoms that you're having um you meet the criteria for what's called a major depressive episode.  Um there's a reason, you have an inciting incident that would explain why you're depressed.  You know you have a lot going on with your parents right now um but it's affecting you quite a bit from what you're telling me.

PATIENT Q111
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q111
So I would recommend treating you um with a medication.  Um it's one of the medications in the class called uh selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and what that means is it increases the amount of serotonin in your brain and serotonin is a chemical that makes us feel better.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

DOCTOR Q111
Um so along the studies have shown that um compared to just giving medication or just having people talk to a therapist the best method is to do both.  You get the best results when you take medication and you talk to someone.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

DOCTOR Q111
Is that something you would be open to?

PATIENT Q111
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay so then you know I think the best thing would be to start a medication and to have you see um a therapist.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

DOCTOR Q111
Um the other thing is in the few weeks right after you start one of these medications, sometimes you're gonna take them 3-4 weeks before you get the full effect of the medication.

PATIENT Q111
Right.

DOCTOR Q111
In the first few weeks sometimes people have increased feelings of suicide so if that's something that you notice to be happening to you then you would want to uh probably talk, go find some help, go to the ER or something because you know that's obviously very serious okay.

PATIENT Q111
Right.

DOCTOR Q111
Alright.  Um second, I can refill all of your medications.  Do you know which ones you need refills on?

PATIENT Q111
Omeprazole.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
Uh hydrochlorothiazide.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
Uh wow, all that's run it on the screen.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
Cause basically all of them.

DOCTOR Q111
Do you pick them up here or do you get them?

PATIENT Q111
I can pick them up here today.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay so I'll make sure that you have refills on everything and you can pick them up at the window.

PATIENT Q111
Thatâ€™s a lot of them.

DOCTOR Q111
Yeah I got them all in my note from the last time I saw you.  So you take the Docusate to help, it's a stool softener.

PATIENT Q111
I don't need those.

DOCTOR Q111
You don't need that okay um but the Advair, it's the inhaler.

PATIENT Q111
Yeah I think I ordered it already. I think itâ€™s the 10 or 12, see that's the problem.  Some of those are about to expire anyway.

DOCTOR Q111
So the ones that are about to expire I can add refills onto them.

PATIENT Q111
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR Q111
Would you rather have those delivered to your house or pick them up here?

PATIENT Q111
I can pick some up today.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.  Um and then the hydrochlorothiazide you said you need.

PATIENT Q111
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q111
Are you taking any of the stool softeners like the Lactulose or the hemorrhoid suppository?

PATIENT Q111
I'm taking the poly um.

DOCTOR Q111
The polyethylene glycol?

PATIENT Q111
The big white bottle.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
Yeah, yeah I'm taking that.  That helps, man that lactose stuff, is that?

DOCTOR Q111
Lactulose okay.

PATIENT Q111
@@@.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.

PATIENT Q111
That big white one I take that one and that makes me use the washroom.

DOCTOR Q111
The metoprolol, that's the other blood pressure one.

PATIENT Q111
Metoprolol yeah I take that.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay, do you need more of that?

PATIENT Q111
Yeah I'm running out of that too.

DOCTOR Q111
Alright and then simvastatin, the one for your cholesterol.

PATIENT Q111
Oh yeah I take that.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay and then you said you need more of the omeprazole.

PATIENT Q111
Asmanex I've run out completely, omeprazole I've run out completely.

DOCTOR Q111
Alright so we'll get those all refilled for you.  

PATIENT Q111
What else, omeprazole, Asmanex, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol.  That's about it yeah.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay.  I'll get them all refilled uh.

PATIENT Q111
So which ones can I pick up over there?

DOCTOR Q111
Which ones did you need to pick, I mean I can make it so you can pick them all up over there.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.  I'll pick them all up today.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay, alright.

PATIENT Q111
I don't have nothing to do.

DOCTOR Q111
We can do that.  Um and then uh I want to add another medication for your asthma.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

DOCTOR Q111
Itâ€™s called tiotropium or Spiriva.

PATIENT Q111
Right.

DOCTOR Q111
Uh you know if you're still having a lot of symptoms.

PATIENT Q111
That's when I have the wheezing, I take them here to here.

DOCTOR Q111
Okay and this will be uh you know you have the asthma medications that you take every day; this will be one of those.  The albuterol is the only asthma medication that you take when you actually have symptoms.

PATIENT Q111
Right.

DOCTOR Q111
All the other ones are controller medications that you'll take every day no matter what.

PATIENT Q111
Oh.

DOCTOR Q111
And that's what this one will be too.

PATIENT Q111
Okay.

DOCTOR Q111
