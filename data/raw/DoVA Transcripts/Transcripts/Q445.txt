DOCTOR Q445 
PATIENT?

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

DOCTOR Q445
Hello.  I'm DOCTOR, I'm glad to meet you.

PATIENT Q445
Glad to meet you.

DOCTOR Q445
Just have a seat here.

PATIENT Q445
Okay.

DOCTOR Q445
@@@ a little bit more, sounds like they @@@ today.

PATIENT Q445
If I could feel it.

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah I know.

PATIENT Q445
I can feel it on the right hand.

DOCTOR Q445
Right there where your leg is, @@@.

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

DOCTOR Q445
@@@.

PATIENT Q445
Okay.  Is there a hangar, a coat rack uh?  Is this @@@ here.

DOCTOR Q445
Alright so you last saw me in April.  Um at that time you were decreasing salt from your diet and you were having some problems with your sleep uh how are you doing now?

PATIENT Q445
Okay the sleep is good.  I found out, I found out what the problem was.

DOCTOR Q445
What was the problem?

PATIENT Q445
I inadvertently would fall asleep on the sofa while watching TV and if I should fall asleep for 20-30 minutes, that would interfere with my sleep cycle.

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah.

PATIENT Q445
And I wasn't able to sleep fully you see.

DOCTOR Q445
Sure.

PATIENT Q445
So I guarded against, I purposely guarded against falling asleep for uh you know a week or so and because there was no interruption in the sleep cycle I slept straight through.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay.

PATIENT Q445
Perhaps maybe 6, 8 hours, no problem yes.  Now in regards to the elevated blood pressure.

DOCTOR Q445
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q445
I've been concerned about it being increased in the last several visits so when I was here in April, I went, I was scheduled to see the nutritionist, which I did.  We had a long talk about diet and such and she gave me a three page document with the do's and don'ts on it.  Foods to eat, foods to avoid etc.

DOCTOR Q445
Uh-huh.  Good.

PATIENT Q445
Now I've been following that list, not religiously.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay.

PATIENT Q445
But I've been, I'm doing the best I can in following that list.

DOCTOR Q445
That's very good.

PATIENT Q445
As long as I do all my own cooking, I limit my carry outs because it's on kind of the no no’s in them.

DOCTOR Q445
Sure.

PATIENT Q445
And I eat fruits, vegetables; drink water all the time, fiber, the works you see.  I come here this morning and the blood pressure's elevated again.  Last time she said, the nurse said the blood pressure was 128 over something or other and today the second reading, first reading was 159 and the second reading was 155.

DOCTOR Q445
Right.

PATIENT Q445
I just don't know what else to do.

DOCTOR Q445
Well it might not be anything that you do; it might just be that you need another medicine to help you out okay.  And you know most patients do require more than one after age 60, 65 so that wouldn't be uncalled for.  You're taking lisinopril 40 right now and you don't miss any doses or anything right?

PATIENT Q445
Right I take it once a day, in the morning.

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah, yeah.  Would you be opposed to starting a new medication to help with your blood pressure and have you come and see us and check your blood pressure and see how that's working.

PATIENT Q445
A new one?

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah so it'd be one more pill a day but I do think that you're probably gonna need that.

PATIENT Q445
Uh uh yeah.  Also one item I heard in the news, uh about a month ago and I haven't had a chance to sit down and research it.  It said something about, it was just a blurb on the news and I know for the full story you have to either read the newspaper, go online, etc., but anyway it said it was a result of a study that said that sodium intake didn't necessarily contribute to high blood pressure.

DOCTOR Q445
Right.

PATIENT Q445
Now I was waiting for some follow-up, you know some news follow-up that says we know that heart disease has passed cancer as the number one killer in this country.

DOCTOR Q445
Right.

PATIENT Q445
So you would think that there would have been some kind of follow-up with an important finding like that you see.  But nothing, nothing.  They would put all kind of other nonsense repeatedly on the news.  You'd think something like that would have prominence, wouldn't you think?

DOCTOR Q445
You would think yeah.

PATIENT Q445
But no it doesn't.  So I was gonna go to Web MD, see what they did on it, I was gonna try to do a Google search to see what they did on it but every time I think about doing that I get a sidetrack on doing something else and I haven't gotten to it and this has been about a month ago.

DOCTOR Q445
Hmm.

PATIENT Q445
Have you heard anything?

DOCTOR Q445
Well I was always taught that you know sodium in patients that already have established hypertension which is known to be idiopathic so they don't know what the etiology is for causing that okay.

PATIENT Q445
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q445
If you have that diagnosis, decreasing your salt intake will help your blood pressure.

PATIENT Q445
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q445
If you don't have hypertension, increasing your salt intake doesn't cause hypertension, if that makes sense to you.

PATIENT Q445
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q445
But in your specific case you have a known diagnosis of high blood pressure, so by decreasing salt it should help your blood pressure.

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

DOCTOR Q445
Or at least not worsen it.

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

DOCTOR Q445
We know that way if you have hypertension and you do eat a lot of salt it will worsen it.

PATIENT Q445
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay but now you're saying you're decreasing the salt and it's not necessarily getting better uh studies don't show that it's necessarily gonna get better, they just show it's not gonna get worse.

PATIENT Q445
I get it.

DOCTOR Q445
If that makes sense.

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

DOCTOR Q445
But we don't want it to get worse.

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

DOCTOR Q445
Now if it's significantly a little bit elevated what that tells me is that your body might need another medication to help control the blood pressure.

PATIENT Q445
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q445
That one medication is not doing that.

PATIENT Q445
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay cause that medication is at its max.

PATIENT Q445
Because what happened was, as I mentioned, in April the pressure was elevated.

DOCTOR Q445
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q445
When I came back several days later in June.

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah.

PATIENT Q445
It was like 128 over some number which was what you wanted to see, you see.

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah.

PATIENT Q445
Now what over the last six months it has gone up again.  Let me ask you this, um since my pressure is so unstable as it is, what about monitoring at home?

DOCTOR Q445
You could.  We could get you a monitor um but how much vision do you have after the macular degeneration.

PATIENT Q445
Uh none.

DOCTOR Q445
@@@ so it might be, do you have someone at home with you?

PATIENT Q445
No.

DOCTOR Q445
Someone to check it for you.

PATIENT Q445
No.  So it's not audible?

DOCTOR Q445
No.

PATIENT Q445
Then it wouldn't help that.

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah so we would just need you to come in to the clinic to get a blood pressure check.  Um let me ask you a few more questions.  So in the past you didn't want a colonoscopy um or screening for prostate cancer.

PATIENT Q445
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay is that the same?

PATIENT Q445
That's the same and I'll tell you what.

DOCTOR Q445
What about vaccinations?  Are you?

PATIENT Q445
Vaccinations for what?

DOCTOR Q445
For tetanus, diphtheria, the flu shot, pneumonia.

PATIENT Q445
No, not those.  Although, although the pneumonia yes.  DOCTOR, two years ago.

DOCTOR Q445
So you've already had that one actually.

PATIENT Q445
Yeah she said for all her patients 55 years or older she recommend a pneumonia shot.

DOCTOR Q445
Right.

PATIENT Q445
And with that I got it.

DOCTOR Q445
Good.

PATIENT Q445
That's the only inoculation I got.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay, that's fine.  So I'll just document that.  

PATIENT Q445
Yeah.  Now this colonoscopy, uh I don't do that screening.

DOCTOR Q445
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q445
And I don't do the PSA as well because if something was found to be abnormal.

DOCTOR Q445
You don't want it; yeah we documented that that you wouldn't want any further.

PATIENT Q445
Yeah, uh if something's there see I don't want to know if it's abnormal cause the reason I don't want to know is I wouldn't do it, go for the treatment.

DOCTOR Q445
I have more questions for you.  Do you smoke or did you smoke in the past?

PATIENT Q445
Uh I smoked in the past but oh it's been years since I've stopped.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay.  So the main thing we need um to I guess get under better control is your blood pressure. Have you been urinating okay?

PATIENT Q445
Oh yes.  

DOCTOR Q445
Do you have a lot of allergies to things?  No?

PATIENT Q445
Uh no because I uh I take this uh, this allergy medication every day.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay.

PATIENT Q445
Uh what is it 25 mg Benadryl.

DOCTOR Q445
Loratadine, you take 10 mg of Loratadine.

PATIENT Q445
Well actually see I stopped taking that.

DOCTOR Q445
Oh you did.

PATIENT Q445
Yeah and I just uh.

DOCTOR Q445
Took Benadryl?

PATIENT Q445
I just take Benadryl.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay.

PATIENT Q445
Once a day.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay and that controls it?

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

DOCTOR Q445
Do you need refills on anything?

PATIENT Q445
Uh the I'm sure the statin uh it's the what is it simvastatin.

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah.

PATIENT Q445
And also the pressure medication lisinopril now you said you might want to add.

DOCTOR Q445
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q445
Another.  

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah we'll talk to DOCTOR about it.

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay let me go get her. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs really quickly.

PATIENT Q445
Okay.

DOCTOR Q445
Deep breath.  Again.  Do you have swelling in your legs at all?

PATIENT Q445
Uh no.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay that's good.  Let me go talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back.

PATIENT Q445
Okay and we're gonna ask about a blood test?

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah.

PATIENT Q445
The lab work that measures the cholesterol.

DOCTOR Q445
Yeah you haven't eaten today right?

PATIENT Q445
No I didn't.  Purposely, every December we do the blood.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay yeah, so we'll get it today then.

PATIENT Q445
Yeah and I purposefully don't eat @@@.

DOCTOR Q445
You know the rules.

PATIENT Q445
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q445
Good.  

(DOCTOR OUT:  30:50  DOCTOR IN:  33:28)

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Hey PATIENT.

PATIENT Q445
DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
How are you?

PATIENT Q445
I feel good thank you.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
You look good.  So you are all settled in your new place?

PATIENT Q445
Beg your pardon?

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
You are settled in that new apartment you were trying to move into last time we saw you?

PATIENT Q445
Uh yes I'm settled.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Okay.

PATIENT Q445
Uh yes uh so now I'm trying to stay healthy.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Okay.

PATIENT Q445
But it's hard.  It's hard.  You know this blood pressure business; I don't know what to do.  You know when I was here before you increased the lisinopril from 20 to 40.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Oh.

PATIENT Q445
Now and as a result of doing that I came back 30 days later, you checked the pressure and it was 128.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Okay.

PATIENT Q445
Just what you wanted to see.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Are you checking it at home?

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
@@@.

PATIENT Q445
There's no way I could check it at home because.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
I wonder if they have like anything @@@.

PATIENT Q445
Yeah that's what I would need, something that would talk.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
But I don't know that we have it but I can put in the request and see what they have.

PATIENT Q445
Yes okay.  But see when I was here uh in April I was so concerned about the salty things.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
You are watching your diet right?

PATIENT Q445
Absolutely.  When I was here in April I talked to the dietician.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Okay alright.  So in that case, two ways we can do, we um, A we can go ahead and start you on a new medication today; B we can have you come back with another visit with the nurse, to see if it's still elevated then we can start at that point so since we didn't have any readings in between but that's what we can do.  Which one do you prefer?

PATIENT Q445
Well with no change in medications starting today I'm sure it's gonna be the same results.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
That's right.  So you would go ahead and start the new medication right now then?

PATIENT Q445
Would it be a new one or an addition to?

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
That's correct because you are already on the maximum dose on the one that you are taking.

PATIENT Q445
I see.  Yeah, yeah okay.  Oh the new one yes.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Okay.

PATIENT Q445
You know I'm just.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Were you ever on a water pill before?

PATIENT Q445
Uh yes, zestoretic is that a drug? 

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT Q445
Is that the chemical for zestoretic?

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Dyazide, no I don't know about that.

PATIENT Q445
Uh I'm not sure of the chemical but before I came, before I was coming to the VA, the zestoretic I believe had a water component to it.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Alright so we'll go ahead and do that, half a dose only, very small dose.

PATIENT Q445
Tell me which one?

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Water pill.

PATIENT Q445
The water pill.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Yeah and then we'll have your blood pressure checked in one month with the pharmacist uh and at that time we'll see.

PATIENT Q445
No you said, now this will be what would be a combination of the anti-hypertensive plus a water pill combined?

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
No you're not on combination only on one tablet of medication.  The lisinopril is by itself.

PATIENT Q445
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
So this is in addition to those meds okay.

PATIENT Q445
Oh so continue with the.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
The lisinopril and you take an additional medicine because one medicine is not controlling your blood pressure.

PATIENT Q445
Is that that water pill?

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
That's correct hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT Q445
I see, I see.  Okay one item, I've been reading about this chemical probiotics.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
No you don't need it.

PATIENT Q445
Don't need it.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Oh probiotics are when you're on long term antibiotics or you're in the hospital, you're on big time antibiotics, no you don't need them.

PATIENT Q445
I see yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR Q445
Alright.

PATIENT Q445
Okay thank you.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
You want to pick this up at the window?

PATIENT Q445
Oh, oh, oh, oh, the lab work.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Yeah I already ordered it; you can just go get it now.

PATIENT Q445
Oh, oh, okay now you said here about the medicine, I'll pick it up.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Or we could send it in the mail.

PATIENT Q445
I'd rather pick it up.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Yeah okay let me put it in, that's a lower one.

PATIENT Q445
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Alright you can pick it up at the window okay.

PATIENT Q445
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
And then you can go to the Lab, I already ordered that for you, okay.

PATIENT Q445
Okay um.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
You're all set.

PATIENT Q445
Um.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
We'll have you check in with the Pharmacy in one month okay.

PATIENT Q445
Okay can I ask you something?  Take a look at this; I'm feeling here and here. Is that a rash.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Nope there's no rash.

PATIENT Q445
Because it was here, here on my.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
I think it's just dry on this one side.

PATIENT Q445
Dry.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
You can just maybe moisturize it.

PATIENT Q445
I see.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q445
I should.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Let me you walk out here and then um you'll need to get some @@@ for it to help you get into the Lab or.

PATIENT Q445
I guess the uh people from uh, what is the department that it is uh, it's the Escort.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Okay let's go get one.

PATIENT Q445
Okay so again uh this is the water pill.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
You take the water pill once a day okay and um you pick it up at the window and then I refilled your lisinopril. Here you go, here’s your jacket.

PATIENT Q445
Okay now, now the name of that again that water?

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
It's called hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT Q445
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
It's a diuretic so it will make you go to the bathroom more okay.

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
So we can cut it, that would be for your blood pressure okay.

PATIENT Q445
I see.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
And we think that this one will help so we have you on a smaller dose of it, we might need to increase it but that's how we do it, we start at a smaller dose and then we increase it okay.

PATIENT Q445
I see, I see.

DOCTOR Q445
Okay I'll take you out to the window so you want to grab my arm?

PATIENT Q445
Uh yes.  Okay.  Yeah I need to come in for the lab work but @@@?

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
So.

PATIENT Q445
Because I wanted the results and you'll let me know @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Okay @@@ ask DOCTOR but you'll be back @@@.

PATIENT Q445
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Um so if @@@ then I'll just call you back and @@@.  But you can always give her a call um if you needed the results and also they can send you a letter to let you know @@@.

PATIENT Q445
I get it.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Okay.

PATIENT Q445
Can I get it in a letter?

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
No problem, I will do that for you.

PATIENT Q445
See the letter; does it give all the details?

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
It will tell you if they're normal, abnormal or @@@ and if you want an actual copy of it @@@ if that makes sense.

PATIENT Q445
When you say, what are you gonna measure and give it to me in the letter.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
It tells you kind of like your blood counts are normal or your blood count was abnormal and your hemoglobin was low like that.  That's what the letter does, it's like a quick.

PATIENT Q445
Okay now what about.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
It can identify what has happened.

PATIENT Q445
Now the cholesterol levels.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
We write that in for you, no problem.

PATIENT Q445
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
I'm gonna get you; there's a line to wait in.

PATIENT Q445
Uh yes uh.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
@@@.

PATIENT Q445
So what do I do uh, how do I @@@?  Do I do it now?

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
Yeah they do it @@@.  Okay.

PATIENT Q445
Okay.  But I can't wait @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
You can always call and get it @@@.

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445

PATIENT Q445
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
You'll get your labs drawn okay.

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
You'll have to wait in line so just tell them, ask the clerk you can give her this.

PATIENT Q445
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR Q445
That you need a parking ticket and you'll probably need an escort @@@.

PATIENT Q445
