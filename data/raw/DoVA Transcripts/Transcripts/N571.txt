Great.  By the way, Happy New Year.

PATIENT N571
Same to you.  @@@.

DOCTOR N571
How's everything been going?

PATIENT N571
So far so good.  I had the surgery on my rotator cuff.

DOCTOR N571
Oh you did.

PATIENT N571
Yeah.  Matter of fact I feel, I don't know why but I felt much better when I wasn’t taking that Plavix for those ten days.

DOCTOR N571
Really.

PATIENT N571
I felt 100% better and that's for real.  When I wasn’t taking the Plavix and the aspirin I felt much better.

DOCTOR N571
In what way?

PATIENT N571
I felt normal.

DOCTOR N571
Alright.  Where'd you have your surgery at?

PATIENT N571
At @@@.

DOCTOR N571
Mercy Works?

PATIENT N571
Yeah.

DOCTOR N571
Uh when was that?

PATIENT N571
Uh January 26th.

DOCTOR N571
And things going okay?

PATIENT N571
Yeah.  I'm getting ready, uh I'm using a robotic chair now for list, for motion and lift up my shoulder and uh I got another week of that and then I'm going to Physical Therapy.  I should be off work until August I guess.  I would've retired this year but I have to wait now and get that six months back so I'm retiring January 31st.  

DOCTOR N571
How's your blood pressure been?

PATIENT N571
My blood pressure's been um, around the same thing it was like today, 142/80.  When I had the surgery, the same day of the surgery, my blood pressure was 180/100 and they took it five minutes later and it was normal.

DOCTOR N571
And how's your foot doing?

PATIENT N571
My foot's better.  My sugar has been great, average reading about 110-115.  

DOCTOR N571
And are you smoking?

PATIENT N571
Still smoking yep.

DOCTOR N571
About five cigarettes a day still?

PATIENT N571
Yeah.

DOCTOR N571
Now were you trying patches or anything like that?

PATIENT N571
I had some patches yeah, I still got some, ain't doing no good.

DOCTOR N571
Well you're almost there.

PATIENT N571
Yeah, yeah.  I'm just waiting for that day when I can wake up and say I ain't smoking no more, just give it up.  I hope yes, that's what I pray for.

DOCTOR N571
Alright, so you said your sugars has been running what?

PATIENT N571
Uh between 90 and the highest it's been since I been on the medicine in September is 180 but it's averaging, on average its like 115.  I got that 180 cause I ate a lot of stuff I shouldn't ate but overall its like between 90 and 115.

DOCTOR N571
Good.  Uh all your rehab is at Mercy Works?

PATIENT N571
Uh yep.

DOCTOR N571
Okay uh so a few things I would like to do.

PATIENT N571
Alright.

DOCTOR N571
Now that it's safe to hold the Plavix.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
Um I know the GI doctors that wanted to do another EGD and colonoscopy.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
Uh the scope from the upper and lower.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
Uh cause you know you had lost quite a bit of blood uh.  I don't remember when that was.

PATIENT N571
Yeah.

DOCTOR N571
I'm sure you, I think it was around what like March?

PATIENT N571
Yeah that was when uh my stool had turned black.

DOCTOR N571
Yeah.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
So um you know they wanted to repeated those tests to make sure everything was kind of resolved.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
But they wanted to wait until it was safe to hold the Plavix.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
And now you know we had to wait at least a year.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
Uh before we could hold the Plavix and I looked at DOCTOR’s note and she's saying you know you're probably going to need it life-long.  They're recommending lifelong Plavix but if you need to, for procedures like the surgery.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
Uh we're okay to hold it for that and she’d like to start it again as soon as possible, alright.  Other stuff um, I would like to get some blood work on you.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
And uh and actually what are you doing for your blood pressure control?

PATIENT N571
Um lisinopril and.

DOCTOR N571
And.

PATIENT N571
And another I forget.  Simvastatin?  Is that it?

DOCTOR N571
Uh that's for your cholesterol.

PATIENT N571
That's cholesterol, simvastatin is cholesterol uh.

DOCTOR N571
It looks like we've just got you on the metoprolol.

PATIENT N571
The metoprolol yeah that's it.

DOCTOR N571
Uh now we can increase that.

PATIENT N571
Metoprolol?

DOCTOR N571
Yeah.

PATIENT N571
To what?

DOCTOR N571
75 twice a day.

PATIENT N571
75, what am I taking now?

DOCTOR N571
You're at 50.

PATIENT N571
Oh okay.  75 twice a day.

DOCTOR N571
I’m sorry, you've go the 50 mg tablets.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
But you're only taking half a pill a day.

PATIENT N571
Half of that yes.

DOCTOR N571
Uh so we can actually increase you to a full tablet.

PATIENT N571
To the full tablet?

DOCTOR N571
Yeah.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
So that should make it easier so won't have to split that one.

PATIENT N571
Okay yeah it is doc.  Well I've gotten good at it, I just take it and put them in my hands, even with it band working itself I can break it in half yep.  Same way with those uh cholesterol pills.  They're bigger, though.

DOCTOR N571
Well let me take a look and listen to you.

PATIENT N571
Alright.

DOCTOR N571
So I can get you going.  

PATIENT N571
Right here?

DOCTOR N571
Yeah.

PATIENT N571
Alright.

DOCTOR N571
This shoulder?

PATIENT N571
Yeah.

DOCTOR N571
Take a few deep breaths.  Okay breathe normal.  Squeeze my fingers close down, good.  And uh which toe had the trouble?  Was it the right one?

PATIENT N571
It was the right one yeah.

DOCTOR N571
It's uh; let's take a look at that.  It looks good.

PATIENT N571
Yeah it was like that after three, three four weeks.  I mean I was blessed because it could've been worse than that couldn't it?

DOCTOR N571
Right.

PATIENT N571
Like my whole leg.

DOCTOR N571
Yeah absolutely.  We do what we can and we try and get the infection taken care of as quick as possible but.

PATIENT N571
Yeah I was going.

DOCTOR N571
But people who get a small portion of a limb cut off often have to go back for you know take bigger hunks off.

PATIENT N571
Really?

DOCTOR N571
Oh yeah.  But I mean we try and do.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
We try and leave people with as much as we can.

PATIENT N571
Yeah but that's what they did.  I got 3/4 of my toe anyway.

DOCTOR N571
Yeah but uh you know some people have to have their foot, you know and all their toes taken off.

PATIENT N571
Yeah.

DOCTOR N571
And uh then you know the reason they have to have their toes taken off is that they've got bad diabetes or vascular disease.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
So that way there were problems in the first place but that also makes it difficult for that wound to heal.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
So then it'll get infected again and the infection will move up and you keep going up the leg which isn't good.

PATIENT N571
Oh okay.

DOCTOR N571
And they want to take a little tiny piece off.

PATIENT N571
Yeah.

DOCTOR N571
Uh but, good, uh alright so uh I actually don't want to do a ton of changes with you since it sounds like you're doing pretty well.  So what I would like to do is repeat some blood work today, are you okay with that?

PATIENT N571
Today?

DOCTOR N571
Yeah.  

PATIENT N571
Yeah, that's okay.

DOCTOR N571
Um so you can get down.

PATIENT N571
What do those cholesterol pills actually do?

DOCTOR N571
Lowers your cholesterol.

PATIENT N571
Yeah.

DOCTOR N571
The cholesterol, high cholesterol puts you at risk for like heart disease.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
Uh different vascular disease.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
Uh, like do you hear about plaques forming in your heart?

PATIENT N571
Yeah.

DOCTOR N571
Or in your blood vessels.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
Uh cholesterol contributes to those plaques.

PATIENT N571
Oh okay.

DOCTOR N571
So the less you have in there the better off you are.

PATIENT N571
Okay.  Okay.  So I'll take the whole pill of metoprolol?

DOCTOR N571
Yeah.

PATIENT N571
Starting tomorrow, I took a half pill today.

DOCTOR N571
Yeah you could even start tonight if you want.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
Take a whole pill tonight.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
Cause you're taking it twice a day right?

PATIENT N571
Twice a day.  Do I take it twice a day?

DOCTOR N571
Yeah.

PATIENT N571
Do I still take it twice a day?

DOCTOR N571
Yeah.

PATIENT N571
A whole pill okay.

DOCTOR N571
When was your last colonoscopy?

PATIENT N571
I never had one.

DOCTOR N571
Never had one?

PATIENT N571
A colonoscopy is when they go into your.

DOCTOR N571
So yeah the same thing only when we go in through your rectum.

PATIENT N571
Oh I never had that.

DOCTOR N571
Okay.

PATIENT N571
But I think they did send a scope up in when I was bleeding internally, they said I had ulcers or something.  Is that the same thing?

DOCTOR N571
It's essentially the same thing.

PATIENT N571
Oh.

DOCTOR N571
It's a slightly different scope but yours wasn't exactly the same.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
But they go in from below.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh, okay.

DOCTOR N571
So what we'll do, I'll put in a consult and have them do both.

PATIENT N571
Today?

DOCTOR N571
No, no.

PATIENT N571
Oh okay.

DOCTOR N571
Uh we'll get the uh, we'll do the blood work today; basically the way the system works it I’ll put it in.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
And then the GI doctors will look at it and review the blood work we did today.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
And then they'll say like yes it's okay to schedule you for that procedure then uh.  You don't have a pacemaker, defibrillator, or anything like that?

PATIENT N571
No.

DOCTOR N571
Now you do have stents right?

PATIENT N571

DOCTOR N571
Okay, you're on metformin?

PATIENT N571
What is that?

DOCTOR N571
For your diabetes.

PATIENT N571
Uh glipizide.

DOCTOR N571
Glipizide.  So I want you on the same one, I need to get out so I do everything uh.  Let me put in these orders and then I'll make sure you can come back and do the labs. (Doctor working on computer 35:23 - 37:45)  I think at some point we're going to need you to repeat your cholesterol.  Uh but that'll likely come, we'll need to do it when you're fasting.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
So.

PATIENT N571
What do you mean repeat my cholesterol?

DOCTOR N571
The cholesterol test.

PATIENT N571
Oh, oh the test.

DOCTOR N571
Yeah.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
So its blood work but you have to do it when you're fasting, so nothing to eat or drink.

PATIENT N571
Okay.

DOCTOR N571
Oh you can water; you can have your medications.

PATIENT N571
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N571
But no.

PATIENT N571
No food.

DOCTOR N571
No coffee or food nothing like that.

PATIENT N571
