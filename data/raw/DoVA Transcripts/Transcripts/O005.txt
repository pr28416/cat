DOCTOR O005
Okay.  Uh are you still using the drugs?

PATIENT O005
Yes sir.

DOCTOR O005
Okay.  So you know obviously it's gonna be very difficult to get like a surgeon or someone to do something about that if you're still doing that um.  I know we've discussed it in the past.  You maybe doing the Outpatient Treatment Program and then doing the Inpatient Treatment Program.  Do you feel like that's something you want to do right now or no?

I'd like to sir.

DOCTOR O005
Okay.

I'm tired you know, every day @@@.

DOCTOR O005
Okay.  Do you know how to get in touch with them?

PATIENT O005
No sir.

DOCTOR O005
Okay.  Uh I believe the way it works here is you go to the Outpatient Treatment Program and you kind of have to show up every day, show them you know that you can be reliable to come here every day and then after a while you transition to the Inpatient Treatment Program.

PATIENT O005
I'd like to, sir.

DOCTOR O005
Okay.

PATIENT O005
I'd like to yes.

DOCTOR O005
Alright.  I can get you some information on somewhere you can go for that uh and you know that's kind of the road you need to start going down and then we can talk about maybe doing something for this back pain okay.

PATIENT O005
Yes sir.

DOCTOR O005
Any other problems?

PATIENT O005
Oh my arms also, especially in my left arm.  I guess because of carrying the suitcase.

DOCTOR O005

PATIENT O005

DOCTOR O005

Before I used this one.

DOCTOR O005
You know how to look to see if it's infected right?

PATIENT O005
Hmm.

DOCTOR O005
If it gets like really red and swollen and hot and painful, then you need to come to the ER okay.

PATIENT O005
I hope that never happens.

DOCTOR O005
I hope you never do as well.  Alright.  What medications are you taking right now?

PATIENT O005
Uh I was taking ibuprofen 600.

DOCTOR O005
They're gone.

PATIENT O005
Yes.

DOCTOR O005
Okay.

PATIENT O005
And.

DOCTOR O005
You just ran out or what?

PATIENT O005
Well uh before run out I was starting stored in my car; I have too many thieves here in Chicago.  When I came back they were already stolen and uh I'm taking uh for the prostate too, they have @@@ I think @@@ mg and multivitamins.

DOCTOR O005
Okay.  Just were you, are you having indigestion?  Like acid reflux?

PATIENT O005
Not all the time uh when I go to shit somtimes it's very hard, I push pretty hard.

DOCTOR O005
Okay.  Uh you may be dehydrated, especially now in the summer.  You're probably outside a lot and you sweat.  You get dehydrated and that's gonna cause that so, plenty of water okay.

PATIENT O005
Oh, yes sir.

DOCTOR O005
Um what do you eat?

PATIENT O005
Oh sometimes I eat lunch and sometimes I have a sister who is up there on Washington, they make very good soup and fruit salads and lettuce salad.

DOCTOR O005
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O005
@@@.

DOCTOR O005
The more fruits and vegetables you eat yet, that's more fiber and that'll make it easier for you to go to the bathroom too.

PATIENT O005
Oh okay.

DOCTOR O005
Okay so a lot of that stuff.

PATIENT O005
Alright sir.

DOCTOR O005
Alright.  Do you need that prostate pill?

PATIENT O005
Oh no I, I lost it the other day, I just got it last week.

DOCTOR O005
Okay so you have some of it still?

PATIENT O005
Yes sir, I still have some.

DOCTOR O005
Good, good.  Um so do you want to keep taking the ibuprofen, were they helping you?

PATIENT O005
Well it helps a little, better than nothing.

DOCTOR O005
Right so I could get you some more of the ibuprofen.

PATIENT O005
Alright.

DOCTOR O005
Uh and then has anyone ever checked your cholesterol?

PATIENT O005
Well a long time ago.

DOCTOR O005
Alright so they just checked it last year.  Your cholesterol looks really good.

PATIENT O005
Thank you.

DOCTOR O005
You're doing something right.  You probably walk a lot every day don't you?

PATIENT O005
Well I paint houses.

DOCTOR O005
You do what?

PATIENT O005
Paint houses.  You know with a cup.

DOCTOR O005
Oh you paint, but you're moving a lot right?

PATIENT O005
Right.

DOCTOR O005
So you walk around the city quite a bit.

PATIENT O005
Well yes I @@@.

DOCTOR O005
That's good for your heart.  That's why your cholesterol looks so good.  Okay.

PATIENT O005
How, you have the numbers there?

DOCTOR O005
Yep.  So the most important numbers are the bad cholesterol um.  Did anyone in your family ever die of a heart attack?

PATIENT O005
Yes sir.

DOCTOR O005
Who?

PATIENT O005
My father.

DOCTOR O005
Your father.  Uh and did anyone, do you uh smoke?

PATIENT O005
Yes.

DOCTOR O005
You do, how much?

PATIENT O005
Um about 8 or 10.

DOCTOR O005
Okay.

PATIENT O005
I'm trying to do less sometimes though.

DOCTOR O005
Um and you don't have diabetes right?

PATIENT O005
My two, my father and my two grandmothers.

DOCTOR O005
But you don't have it?

PATIENT O005
Uh I hope I don't.  I have it in the family.

DOCTOR O005
I don't think you do.  So yours should be less than 130 and its 111 so you're doing great.

PATIENT O005
Oh.

DOCTOR O005
And then your good cholesterol should be greater than 45 and it's 52.

PATIENT O005
Oh.

DOCTOR O005
That's also good.  Alright.

PATIENT O005
And one thing that I always forget and now it's on my mind now about the prostate uh how uh, how do I say this in English uh, what the prognosis uh in the future of if I.

DOCTOR O005
Right.

PATIENT O005
That might get cancer?

DOCTOR O005
So um has anyone in your family ever had prostate cancer?

PATIENT O005
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR O005
No.  And you were, so the high-risk rate for having prostate cancer is African-American and you're not African-American.   You have no family history of prostate cancer um so even if we, there's two tests you can do.  There's a blood test and then you can do an exam where you have to stick a finger in your butt to feel your prostate and based on what we find on those sometimes they recommend biopsies but there's a lot of evidence that shows that we end up biopsying too many people and causing more problems than we're actually helping people.

PATIENT O005
Hmm.

DOCTOR O005
So I would not recommend we even do that.  I think your prostate problem is very normal for someone your age and you don't have any family history of problems so I wouldn't want to go any further down that road okay.

PATIENT O005
Okay.  Um @@@ generally in the population.

DOCTOR O005
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O005
How, like a percent that you know.

DOCTOR O005
Right, right.

PATIENT O005
Give me a statistic.

DOCTOR O005
So if you um, if everyone so let's do like 90, if you cut them open when they die and looked at their prostate, almost all of them would have prostate cancer.  But in most people it's a very slow growing non-dangerous tumor.

PATIENT O005
Hmm.

DOCTOR O005
So if you, if you start drawing the blood tests on people and if you see it looks a little elevated, maybe we should do a biopsy or maybe we should take the prostate out.  You're probably gonna cause more problems with those surgical procedures than you're gonna fix because most of those people would have lived their regular, normal, completely healthy life and never had any problems with that prostate cancer okay.

PATIENT O005
Oh okay, thank you so much.

DOCTOR O005
So I think in you I would recommend not even testing it okay.  How many times do you have to get up at night to go to the bathroom?

PATIENT O005
Before @@@ a bunch of times time but.

DOCTOR O005
But now that you're on the terazosin you don't?

PATIENT O005
Mainly about two, three times.  Sometimes I sleep straight.

DOCTOR O005
Good.

PATIENT O005
@@@.

DOCTOR O005
Alright.  Let me go talk to my boss and we'll get you moving okay.

PATIENT O005
Yes sir.

DOCTOR O005
Alright I'll see you in a little bit.

PATIENT O005
Alright sir.  I wait outside?

DOCTOR O005
You what?  You can wait right here, you're fine.

PATIENT O005
Oh okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  56:19  DOCTOR IN:  61:55)

DOCTOR O005
Alright so here's what we're gonna do today.  When you leave you can schedule your follow-up appointment here um, just go out front and tell them you need to come back in six months right and then whenever you're ready to try the Outpatient Rehab Program, do you know where the PACC is, right across from the ER, you can just walk in there any day.  Okay I'll put the consult in the computer and they'll be ready for you whenever um you want to show up and then you want, we'll get you the ibuprofen, the NIX hair wash and then you need some of the omeprazole for your stomach, for your reflux okay, we'll get that as well.  Alright.

PATIENT O005
Thank you.

DOCTOR O005
Anything else?

PATIENT O005
Not right now, I don't think so.

DOCTOR O005
Alright.  I'll see you back in six months okay.

PATIENT O005
Alright sir.

DOCTOR O005
Alright.  It was good to see you, take care of yourself okay.

PATIENT O005
