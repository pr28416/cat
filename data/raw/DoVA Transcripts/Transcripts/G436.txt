PATIENT G436
Oh if you say I have to take it, I will take it.

DOCTOR G436
You should take it with your CHF.  So I'll order it.  Your CHF has been pretty controlled so if you feel like you're doing well without it you could just keep monitoring it.

PATIENT G436
Okay keep monitoring.

DOCTOR G436

PATIENT G436
I ran out of that.

DOCTOR G436
Okay.  @@@.  

PATIENT G436
And I got a question when you get through.

DOCTOR G436
Sure, you can ask it.

PATIENT G436
Okay.  The reason why I don't want to get back on that what isosorbide.

DOCTOR G436
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G436
Because I can't take Viagra with that.

DOCTOR G436
Right you definitely cannot.

PATIENT G436
Right so that's why I don't want to get back on it cause I want to get back, I’m trying to get Viagra.

DOCTOR G436
Well you still can't get back on Viagra because it's dangerous for your heart condition but definitely not when your taking that medication.  What about hydralazine?

PATIENT G436
I'm taking that.

DOCTOR G436
Okay.  The reason why I don't want to put you back on the Viagra to be honest is that if you were to have a heart attack and you needed nitrates that'd be really dangerous.  Um are you taking the metoprolol still?

PATIENT G436
Yeah.  So they say I don't need to have sex and that's it.

DOCTOR G436
Well I don't want to tell you don't have sex.

PATIENT G436
Yeah @@@ I can't even get that @@@ to work.  One of the pills, one of them come.

DOCTOR G436
And you can't have sex without it?

PATIENT G436
Uh uh.

DOCTOR G436
Well I'll talk to DOCTOR I just with all the medications that you're taking, probably that's probably one of the reasons too.

PATIENT G436
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR G436
Let me talk to DOCTOR.  Okay I think that we got through all your medications enough so we're in a good place now.

PATIENT G436
Okay.

DOCTOR G436
Alright, I'll sign all of this.

PATIENT G436
I had took blood work would that let you know if I need the insulin, I mean not the insulin, the anemia shot or do I have to wait till I go back upstairs.

DOCTOR G436
Wait until you go back upstairs, but I think your blood work was fine actually that's why I don't want to um.

PATIENT G436
Okay.

DOCTOR G436
Let me look.  I'll look at it but I remember I was glancing at it before and I think it looked fine.

PATIENT G436
And the less shots I take that's cool with me.  Oh, I need some, I used to get this nasal spray.  It's uh.

DOCTOR G436
Yeah why do you need the nasal spray?

PATIENT G436
Cause I get, my nose shuts off at night, it closes.  I can't hardly breathe.  I used to get it but then I ran out and never refilled it uh I forgot the name of it.  It was @@@, something like that.  When the bottle say to use by such and such I throwed it away.  I should have kept it.  I forgot the name of it.

DOCTOR G436
Was it flunisolide, looks like they're sending, @@@?

PATIENT G436
No it just squirt like that, squeeze it up there, it's like a solution uh.

DOCTOR G436
Yeah I think that's flunisolide @@@.

PATIENT G436
It's the name like deep C.

DOCTOR G436
Hmm, I don't know that doesn't sound familiar but I'll give you something.  We'll be fine; you take two sprays up your nose with that.

PATIENT G436
What's the name of that?

DOCTOR G436
Flunisolide it's the thing that you put up your nose.  I think it'll help you.

PATIENT G436
Okay.  You can mail that to me.

DOCTOR G436
Okay.  Alright.  And what else, oh how have your blood sugars been?

PATIENT G436
Oh since I take the shot at night once a day it works out pretty good.

DOCTOR G436
When did you start taking this at night?  That was a while ago right?

PATIENT G436
Yeah.

DOCTOR G436
So the problem is, is what has it been?

PATIENT G436
It's been, if I go to sleep with my sugar at 200 I can last till 6 o'clock in the morning but if I go less than 200 about 1 o'clock if I don't eat a half a sandwich or something at night at about 1 or 12 o'clock, by 6 in the morning in the morning it be about 40 something.

DOCTOR G436
Okay.

PATIENT G436
So since I keep it at 200 I wake up it be a decent thing in the morning, like 90 to 108, 102.

DOCTOR G436
How much are you taking?

PATIENT G436
Uh I think 12 units.

DOCTOR G436
Okay.

PATIENT G436
But it varies from 12 to 14 I think.

DOCTOR G436
Do you ever feel when your sugar goes low?

PATIENT G436
Nope.  Except if I'm sitting at home - walking I might just fall down I know it get me.

DOCTOR G436
So do you take any um, any insulin with food with your.

PATIENT G436
With @@@?.

DOCTOR G436
What food, with your meals?

PATIENT G436
Oh uh I takes it at bedtime.  This is after dinner.

DOCTOR G436
Oh so you don't take it ever with the meals?

PATIENT G436
No this one.

DOCTOR G436
But that your….

PATIENT G436
This is 10 o'clock at night before I go to bed so I done ate dinner and everything.

DOCTOR G436
So um do you take your finger stick, how often do you check your glucose during the day?

PATIENT G436
Twice.

DOCTOR G436
So once in the morning and once at night?

PATIENT G436
Yep.

DOCTOR G436
What about in the midday?

PATIENT G436
No I ain’t punching myself that many times, that's why I only have one shot.  I get.

DOCTOR G436
Would you be willing to take more than one shot?

PATIENT G436
No.  So what I do is I just eat lunch anyway, you know what I'm saying.  Cause I know it usually, it be, go down between that time, between 7 in the morning and 12 I know it's about time to eat so I then ate so there wasn't no reason to take it.  But do you want me to go back to it?

DOCTOR G436
Well I just wanted you to see, cause it's weird that your sugars are down so low at night.  I was hoping that we could get you to check your sugar maybe three or four times a day for the next couple weeks and then we can adjust it.

PATIENT G436
Adjust it again?

DOCTOR G436
Yeah.

PATIENT G436
But you know, when am I gonna get one of those things where you don’t gotta stick yourself.

DOCTOR G436
Well, when one is invented.

PATIENT G436
They have one, it's on TV it says put it on your arm and wait till your blood @@@.

DOCTOR G436

DOCTOR G436
It's still doing it?

PATIENT G436
No every, I get it when I go back in there.

DOCTOR G436
Okay.

PATIENT G436
When I be constipated I got to go back in there and strain.

DOCTOR G436
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G436
But then after I get that first, excuse me, poop out, I'll be okay.

DOCTOR G436
Alright so what I want you to do, seriously, is do you think for two weeks you could take @@@ and check your blood sugars three or four times a day and then come back in and see our pharmacist to adjust your insulin?

PATIENT G436
Are you gonna give me an appointment to come back in and see the pharmacist?

DOCTOR G436
Yeah.

PATIENT G436
Okay.

DOCTOR G436
In two weeks.  Would you do it, just for two weeks?

PATIENT G436

DOCTOR G436
I know it's a pain in the butt but I just get worried that your sugar goes so low and I want to see what it's kind of doing throughout the day.

PATIENT G436
