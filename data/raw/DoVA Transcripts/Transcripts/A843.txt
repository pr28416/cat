PATIENT A843
No it didn't hurt after I fell.

SECOND PERSON A843
He hadn't swolled up or nothing.

PATIENT A843
Yeah no swelling.

SECOND PERSON A843

PATIENT A843

DOCTOR A843
How did you fall?

DOCTOR A843

PATIENT A843
It goes away.

DOCTOR A843
But I mean if you stand on it does that cause it or if you walk more does that cause the pain to come?

PATIENT A843
No because I’m not walking too much @@@, but I have to say it's just like a sharp pain that goes through it.

SECOND PERSON A843
Every so often.

PATIENT A843
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A843
It's just like he'll be sitting there and the pain will hit him.

PATIENT A843

SECOND PERSON A843

DOCTOR A843
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON A843
You better show him that, that's what I want to talk to you about.  I think it’s something in his medicine because I went over there and he could hardly hold his coffee cup, he shaking just like this.  Something was making him do it.

DOCTOR A843

DOCTOR A843
Okay.  How about the albuterol?  Do you use that inhaler a lot?

PATIENT A843
Not a lot yeah.

DOCTOR A843
Cause that can definitely cause that.

PATIENT A843
It can?

DOCTOR A843
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A843
Albuterol can cause that?

DOCTOR A843
Oh yeah.

SECOND PERSON A843

DOCTOR A843
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON A843
Okay.  Now I see on here he's taking two of the same kind of medicines, really what is all this stuff he's taking?  @@@.

PATIENT A843
Something like 400 mg.

SECOND PERSON A843
@@@ all this stuff @@@.  You have @@@, do you see this @@@ regimen that's for stuff he's got here.  @@@ do you take this a lot?  @@@ these doctors they @@@ the same stuff right here, let me see what that said.  Do you take this medicine?

PATIENT A843
You mean @@@?

SECOND PERSON A843
He don't take that, so don't give that one, he's trying to rule out what's making you sick.  @@@.

PATIENT A843
Uh.  Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A843
@@@.

PATIENT A843
Now I take this and this.

SECOND PERSON A843
How come your cholesterol pill @@@ this one here but I don't know @@@ more than once, I don't know that one.

PATIENT A843
No @@@.

SECOND PERSON A843
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A843
@@@ I don’t take any of those.

SECOND PERSON A843
I don't see that.

PATIENT A843
These two here is 1/2 but that’s 200.

SECOND PERSON A843
Okay well what, why would he give you two of the same things?

DOCTOR A843
Which one?

PATIENT A843
@@@

SECOND PERSON A843
@@@ me?

PATIENT A843
What, no.

SECOND PERSON A843
Oh is that @@@ at?

PATIENT A843
Yeah that's uh.

DOCTOR A843
Which, what is that name?

SECOND PERSON A843
He @@@, he's taken a half and one all he has to do is just cutting one in half.

DOCTOR A843
That's from.

PATIENT A843
That's all I do is take one and a half.

SECOND PERSON A843
One and a half is two, two times @@@.

DOCTOR A843
That's for mental health.

PATIENT A843
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A843
I know.

DOCTOR A843
You have to talk with DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON A843
I'll talk to him, I'll just go.

PATIENT A843
Yeah see here this is because it's one tablet and its 400 mg so.

SECOND PERSON A843
Okay.

PATIENT A843
So cut it in half.

SECOND PERSON A843
Well this is 350, okay.  If you take them, @@@ and if you cut that @@@ that's it.

PATIENT A843 
He wanted it to be @@@.

SECOND PERSON A843
Okay, that's what I'm saying, @@@ not anymore, then all you have to do is you got to pill in half, you cut one pill in half and take one in the morning and one at night. 

DOCTOR A843
These are the same prescriptions.

PATIENT A843
Right.

SECOND PERSON A843
That's what I'm saying.

PATIENT A843
@@@.

DOCTOR A843
@@@.

SECOND PERSON A843
And they're the same.

DOCTOR A843
Don't worry about that, that's not a big deal because he only gets one, one set of pills at a time and if he has two, three, four prescriptions, it doesn't matter, it's not like he's getting charged more and we only charge you on the pills that they distribute and what that means is that when someone orders a prescription instead of renewing it they just order another prescription for the same thing.

SECOND PERSON A843
Oh.

DOCTOR A843
It's just listed twice.

SECOND PERSON A843
But do not; he's not getting it twice?  And he's got two bottles at home.

PATIENT A843
No I don't.

SECOND PERSON A843
You don't?

PATIENT A843
I have one bottle.

SECOND PERSON A843
You have @@@.

DOCTOR A843
That's not a big deal and uh.

PATIENT A843
@@@ cut in half.

SECOND PERSON A843
Okay then.

PATIENT A843
If it comes to me it is one pill.

SECOND PERSON A843
Yeah I know.

PATIENT A843
And then I cut it in half.

SECOND PERSON A843
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A843
Take one in the morning and one in the evening.

SECOND PERSON A843
Yeah but I thought you was getting two different bottles, that's what I thought.

DOCTOR A843
No, no.

SECOND PERSON A843
@@@.

DOCTOR A843
Okay, anything else?

PATIENT A843
That's good enough.

DOCTOR A843
We talked about shaking, we talked about urination @@@, we are going to check your urine.  I'm gonna draw some blood today um it's been a little while since we've done some of those, the basic blood tests on you.

PATIENT A843
Yeah.

DOCTOR A843
Um so we'll just check some other, some basic blood tests to make sure that everything looks okay, cholesterol, electrolytes all of that okay.

PATIENT A843
Okay.

DOCTOR A843
And um your blood levels.

SECOND PERSON A843
Okay and that mean he's not supposed to have eaten anything today right?

DOCTOR A843

SECOND PERSON A843

DOCTOR A843

SECOND PERSON A843

SECOND PERSON A843

SECOND PERSON A843

PATIENT A843
One little ole.

SECOND PERSON A843
A little ole um.

DOCTOR A843
When?

SECOND PERSON A843
You didn't eat nothing @@@.

PATIENT A843
No way.

SECOND PERSON A843
When, when we were coming over here, that was about 10:30, about 10:30.

DOCTOR A843
Okay.  Alright @@@.

SECOND PERSON A843
Might have been 11, it might have been 11.

DOCTOR A843
We'll be able to draw some lab work.

SECOND PERSON A843
It might have been 12 @@@.

DOCTOR A843
Anything else?  Do you need refills of any of your medicines?

PATIENT A843
Uh I could probably @@@.

DOCTOR A843
I'll refill all of them.

PATIENT A843
So now what are you saying about the shaking because I’m not shaking today @@@.
 
SECOND PERSON A843
Uh uh you didn't take your medicine today either.

PATIENT A843
No I didn't.

SECOND PERSON A843
Well, that’s probably why you’re not shaking.

DOCTOR A843
Well the other thing too is you know how are you taking the medicine?  Are you taking it, are you taking it with food?  No, how come?

SECOND PERSON A843
@@@.

PATIENT A843
I don’t eat that early.

DOCTOR A843
It's not eating or not having food in the stomach or taking medicines on an empty stomach, you know now there's some medicines that you're supposed to do that.

PATIENT A843
Right.

DOCTOR A843
But most medicines you want to take with food um but a couple of things, number one is the medicines can upset the stomach or @@@ that you know takes care of that and other people have you know some @@@.  Uh @@@ you know if I had to guess.  How often are you using the albuterol?

PATIENT A843
Not that often.

DOCTOR A843
Once a day?

SECOND PERSON A843
Uh uh.

PATIENT A843
Uh uh.

SECOND PERSON A843
@@@ the medicine.  He'll utilized it @@@.

PATIENT A843
Yeah, no uh.

SECOND PERSON A843
You use it @@@ a day okay.

DOCTOR A843
How many times, once, twice a day?

PATIENT A843
Once a day.

DOCTOR A843
Okay if I had to guess that it was any of your medicines, it's that cause that is well known.  It makes your heart rate go up, it makes people jittery um I took albuterol and it does that to me um it's just one of those side effects of the albuterol @@@.

PATIENT A843
Well will uh Depakote and @@@ cause I'm taking 1500 mg at night.

DOCTOR A843
At night.

PATIENT A843
At night.

DOCTOR A843
Uh-huh.  And when are you shaking the most?  Is it all day or in the morning or?

PATIENT A843
In the morning yeah after uh I get up and when I get up.

DOCTOR A843
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A843
And if I have coffee and then I start shaking.

DOCTOR A843
You got a coffee?

PATIENT A843
Yeah.

DOCTOR A843
Coffee can do that too.  And you're not eating anything?  Are you eating breakfast every morning?  Uh you know, everything that you've mentioned is @@@ could be causing you know the coffee, not eating, uh the albuterol which if I would guess I would say it'd be the albuterol but I, you know, I don't know when you, it depends on when you take the albuterol and then when you have your shaking, uh you know having taken the medicines on an empty stomach that can also you know cause that.  You're not shaking right now um so it'd probably.

PATIENT A843
That's because I had no medication and no coffee.

DOCTOR A843
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A843
No you @@@.  

DOCTOR A843
@@@.

SECOND PERSON A843
They say yes @@@.  I'm telling you when he has his coffee in his hand he shakes so, the coffee done come out of his cup, he be shaking and stuff and I say @@@ what is happening here and he say I think it my medicine I'm taking you know.

PATIENT A843
And I see the doctor and he told me that @@@ has a side effect of that.

SECOND PERSON A843
Yeah maybe we could tell them that's not helping @@@ maybe we just tell that doctor about @@@.

DOCTOR A843
I'm just looking it up now.

SECOND PERSON A843
@@@ shaking @@@.

DOCTOR A843
Yeah, that could also be the cause.

PATIENT A843
Depakote.

DOCTOR A843
Depakote yeah.  Um what I would do is I would take your medicine when you eat something.  You should be eating @@@, you should have three solid meals a day.

SECOND PERSON A843
Definitely @@@.

PATIENT A843
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A843
Even if you eat a banana and take your medicine or an orange.

DOCTOR A843
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON A843
I bought you some oranges over there every day.

DOCTOR A843
You should put something in your stomach you know.  The first thing that your stomach seed should not be a bunch of medicines.

PATIENT A843
Well I, drink orange juice.

SECOND PERSON A843
I told you about having an orange.

DOCTOR A843

SECOND PERSON A843
Any time @@@, oranges, bananas.

DOCTOR A843
Okay.  Um anything else?  I refilled all of your medicines that were low.  And everything you had one refill on, I renewed everything.  Um we're gonna get some blood work today.  Is there anything else that you wanted to take care of today?

PATIENT A843
No uh I think that's about it.

SECOND PERSON A843
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A843
And I'm @@@ to see the doctors @@@.

DOCTOR A843
Did you get your flu shot today?

PATIENT A843
I'm not gonna get it either.

DOCTOR A843

PATIENT A843
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR A843

PATIENT A843
@@@.

SECOND PERSON A843
Uh uh.

DOCTOR A843
You don't want it?

PATIENT A843
No.

SECOND PERSON A843

PATIENT A843
Oh yeah.

SECOND PERSON A843
You have to clean yourself out and drink all that stuff it's uh, @@@ what you want?

PATIENT A843
@@@.

SECOND PERSON A843

PATIENT A843

SECOND PERSON A843
Did the medicine help?

PATIENT A843
It's the sugar.

DOCTOR A843
@@@.

SECOND PERSON A843
He said he's gonna @@@.

PATIENT A843
@@@.

DOCTOR A843
Are you checking your sugars at home?

PATIENT A843
Yeah.  I have been um, a nurse NAME and uh a doctor comes once a month and the nurse comes once a week.

DOCTOR A843
Okay, we'll check it today.

PATIENT A843
Okay.  What are you saying about that?

DOCTOR A843
There's a couple here that are a little high but I want to, I want to check something called an A1c, it's like your sugar, it reflects your sugar over the last three months.

PATIENT A843
Okay.

DOCTOR A843
So if it's chronically high and your A1c is high then we'll probably need to start something to help your sugars okay.  But those number really aren't that bad.  There's a couple there that are pretty high but I don't know if I'm willing to say that that's diabetes, that you have diabetes.

SECOND PERSON A843
Uh-huh, he's borderline.  It runs in the family.

DOCTOR A843
Okay.

PATIENT A843
This is something else that the doctor wrote, what do you think?

DOCTOR A843
Okay @@@.  Alright, we may, this is actually, this is good that you brought this in because this is the blood test that I would have ordered um and it looks a little high um so.  Let me see what DOCTOR whether or not she would you us to start you on something or whether or not you know you want to work on, well let's talk about it.  I need to talk to her, I think that she will want to start you on you know a little -  diabetes medicine because you keep telling me you know you're blood pressure is high, I mean your blood sugar is high when you’re on an empty stomach. That not normal, @@@.

SECOND PERSON A843
How high was it, how high was it?

DOCTOR A843
135.

SECOND PERSON A843
Hmm.

DOCTOR A843
And close to the top, 126 is the cut off so anything above 126 on an empty stomach is uh diagnosed as diabetes.

SECOND PERSON A843
Did you have an empty stomach that day you took it?  So when did you take it?

DOCTOR A843
@@@?

SECOND PERSON A843
