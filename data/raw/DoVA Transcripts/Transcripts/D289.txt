DOCTOR D289
Oh okay.

PATIENT D289
It's like it sends my system into shock or something.

DOCTOR D289
Sure.  Okay um.

PATIENT D289
Which I think is good.  With everyone having problems with drugs, I've known better than to even try it though.  It's, I guess that's been a good thing.

DOCTOR D289
I think it is.  You finished your antibiotics um.  Your diabetes numbers actually look okay.  Kidneys look, your kidney numbers look a little high.  Were you not eating or drinking so well?  You know when you first had gone to the Emergency Room?

PATIENT D289
I probably wasn't drinking that much.

DOCTOR D289
Yeah.  Yeah.  (Doctor answers a page) Sorry, last time, um so it looks like your cholesterol's a little high.  I think uh you know we could try to control that with diet and exercise but um.

PATIENT D289
I've been eating too much @@@.

DOCTOR D289
But you know it's uh, it's something to you know think about if um you know, get you started with some medication, once daily that you would take at nighttime that would help bring your cholesterol down.  You don't have any liver disease which is good.  Um and I think let's see, these are your last numbers looked good alright and you had an eye exam right in January.

PATIENT D289
Uh-huh, I got glasses.

DOCTOR D289
Let me take a quick listen to you.  Take a deep breath.  Take one more time. Very good. Breathe normally, just regular breathing.  And this isn’t painful at all?

PATIENT D289
No.

DOCTOR D289
Okay, alright.  Okay.  You haven't noticed a bunch of swelling in your legs?

PATIENT D289
No.  @@@.

DOCTOR D289
Yeah.  Take off your glasses for one second and look straight ahead at me.  Say ah.

PATIENT D289
Ah.

DOCTOR D289
Good.  Now do you have a tooth that's been hurting?

PATIENT D289
Yeah.  I’ve got one, it was uh, it had a ceramic filling.

DOCTOR D289
Okay.

PATIENT D289
And it came out.

DOCTOR D289
Okay.

PATIENT D289
But I'm scheduled for; I think it's June 2nd.

DOCTOR D289
Dental appointment okay.  Um we should maybe give you like a topical or something that would help the pain.  You know like an Orajel like a cream or something.

PATIENT D289
Good.

DOCTOR D289
That might help.

PATIENT D289
Good.

DOCTOR D289
Swallow, no lumps or bumps anywhere?

PATIENT D289
No.

DOCTOR D289
Alright.  Um I'm gonna run this by DOCTOR who is my attending and we'll see what we can do for you.  But um, when do you think the last time you took your blood pressure medicine was?

PATIENT D289
Uh probably, that was on the 8th, about the 4th.

DOCTOR D289
The 4th okay.

PATIENT D289
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D289
@@@ okay and your diabetes @@@.

PATIENT D289
Yeah.

DOCTOR D289
Okay.

PATIENT D289
Yeah.

(DOCTOR OUT:  21:32  DOCTOR IN:  27:10)

DOCTOR D289
Alright sir, okay.  So um okay um a couple of things we're gonna do.  We're gonna start you back on your home meds okay on the diabetes stuff and for the blood pressure.

PATIENT D289
Those, I’ve already got.

DOCTOR D289
Right.  So go ahead and start taking them because your blood pressure is still too high so we need you to come in two weeks for your blood pressure check.  You don't have to see me, you can just see the nurse and they can check it really quick and uh you know uh let us know.  At that time, you know if we want to then change your medications but there's sort of no point if you haven't taken it for a while. 

PATIENT D289
Right.

DOCTOR D289
We don't even know if what you're taking is working.  Um there are a couple other things, let's see, okay.  So we're doing this, we need your blood pressure; we'll get you a tetanus shot.  That's just the one that when you like brush up against metal or something like that, like rusty metal you can get tetanus from that so it's a shot you get once every ten years, it's uh and yeah that is not bad.

PATIENT D289
No side effects?

DOCTOR D289
No usually it's just the arm soreness.  And many times there's actually, you know they would prefer @@@.  Some people find that, I'm sure you've had other vaccinations in the past at some time but it usually doesn't @@@ them.  Um then um we're gonna get you an ultrasound of your abdomen.  I know they had done some pictures before but the think is that we’d like to see the part of your blood vessels where they go into your stomach because you have a history of using tobacco you're at increased risk of having what they call an aneurysm which mean that the blood vessel is big so for all men who are over 65 who have a smoking history, you know it's for pregnant women, it’s the same thing, they just put goop on your belly and it doesn't hurt.

PATIENT D289
Hmm.

DOCTOR D289
So, I signed you up for that.  Um so um @@@.  We'll get your tetanus shot.  For your tooth, I think I'm going to try some, it's a topical thing that we give, I think it's just the thing that you kind of put in your mouth and swish around like a mouthwash and you spit it out.  (Doctor makes phone call)  Okay we're gonna start you on a low dose cholesterol medication.  The fact that you're a diabetic and you have high blood pressure means you should be on a cholesterol medication and a baby aspirin.

PATIENT D289
Okay.

DOCTOR D289
So we can address that.

PATIENT D289
I've got I think its 8 grams or 8 mm.

DOCTOR D289
81.

PATIENT D289
Yeah, I've got that.

DOCTOR D289
Uh-huh.  And would like to pick up this medication here?  Well I guess we’ve never mailed it to you @@@, so you should pick it up here right?

PATIENT D289
Yeah.

DOCTOR D289
Good.

PATIENT D289
They could mail them; no they can mail it out.

DOCTOR D289
Oh does that work?

PATIENT D289
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D289
Okay.  (Doctor continues phone call) What other reaction have you had?  It has listed an allergy that you have had a reaction to anesthetics, what happens?

PATIENT D289
Only, the only one that really bothers me has been @@@.

DOCTOR D289
(Doctor continues phone call) Okay I think we should be okay.

PATIENT D289
Yeah and the only thing that bothers me is.

DOCTOR D289
(Doctor continues phone call) So I think we'll just try that, it's like a mouthwash just kind of do that okay.  So um take your medications, come back in two weeks, you'll get your tetanus shot today um and then we'll @@@.

PATIENT D289
Okay great.

DOCTOR D289
Does that sound good?  And you'll see me back in like six months.

PATIENT D289
Okay.

DOCTOR D289
Sounds like a plan?  Um let's see.  Oh I have these to pick up here, do you want me to mail them to you or do you want to wait?

PATIENT D289
They can mail them.

DOCTOR D289
Okay.  So the shot you have to get here.

PATIENT D289
Okay.

DOCTOR D289
The shot unfortunately, we can’t mail to you.

PATIENT D289
Yeah.  The um.

DOCTOR D289
Right.  

PATIENT D289
Okay.  

DOCTOR D289
Cause.

PATIENT D289
The vaccination.  They'll do that today here?

DOCTOR D289
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D289
I can't remember that name of that local anesthesia they gave me.

DOCTOR D289
That's okay.  It should be alright.  Well you know I mean it's just a mouthwash.  Just try a little bit.  If you feel weird don't take it, you know.

PATIENT D289
No I'll be okay.

DOCTOR D289
And uh I will send you with this so.  Okay.

PATIENT D289
Okay good.

DOCTOR D289
And then.

PATIENT D289
Okay am I free to go teach.

DOCTOR D289

PATIENT D289
