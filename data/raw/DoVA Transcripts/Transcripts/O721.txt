DOCTOR O721
When they were working, when they were trying to figure out what's going on with the pain down there?

DOCTOR O721
I've got to look here and see what they were talking about.

PATIENT O721
So my problem is once I got out of this, I thought I got out of this, I still, this side just a @@@ and @@@ a day got me a clip @@@.  This one over here @@@ sleep on it.

PATIENT O721
Uh let me find here, what is it?

SECOND PERSON O721
Dilaudid.  My husband is on Dilaudid.  His problem here today.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
It's I wanted him to come here to it's just that, I was hoping that ya'll would do a follow-up.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
On his electrolytes.  He had an electrolytes imbalance I think.

DOCTOR O721
That's because of the thyroid.

SECOND PERSON O721
His calcium, his phosphorus, everything is fine?

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Well all his electrolytes.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Plus his pain was not controlled okay.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Plus they are suspicious that he might have a hernia, that's why I'm here today and then the main reason why I wanted a follow-up appointment, which I had to beg for an appointment.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Is they still have not set up a @@@ appointment.  They have not controlled the pain even though he has the Fentanyl patch.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
He has the Lidoderm patch and he's had Dilaudid, but his pain is not controlled and he has an anxiety medication that they are administering, but his pain is not controlled even though he's under Hospice @@@.  Uh more than any problem it seems that his pain is out of control.  The new problem, the new secondary problem to his cancer.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Is this uh, I don't want to diagnosis, is this possible rule out a hernia.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
He has a knot that he did not have in December or January.  Now it's real prominent.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And when you do your um your examination.

DOCTOR O721
I need to take a look at it.

SECOND PERSON O721
When you examine him, I'm sure when you palpate, you will see it.  It's very prominent and we've been putting Lidoderm patches on it.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And um and it's not you know, relieved or controlled you know with the Fentanyl patch or the Dilaudid.  Dilaudid is given every two hours.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
And the Fentanyl patch is every 72 hours.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And um this a lot of the patch is local with every 12 hours on, on for 12 hours, off for 12 hours but um that is not um.

DOCTOR O721
Where do you get the Lidoderm patch from cause I don't see it in here?

PATIENT O721
Uh that ones from.

SECOND PERSON O721
It's from his hospice doctor.

DOCTOR O721
Oh from the hospice doctor okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh-huh.  And um my husband is very uncomfortable he has a lot of abdominal pain and discomfort, it may be a possible hernia.  Uh we don't know what it is.

DOCTOR O721
And this has happened since December?

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh since January when we were discharged.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
But I mean, it was probably there all along but I mean it's probably growing larger to now to where it's like protruding out.  He's had two uh bowel obstruction surgeries, 2003, July 2003 the bowel obstruction surgery and then after that he had a lot of adhesions and another bowel obstruction surgery in 2011 July at the Little Company of Mary.

DOCTOR O721
July of 2011?

SECOND PERSON O721
2003 he had a bowel obstruction surgery.

DOCTOR O721
Okay uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And also 2011 July, same month, bowel obstruction surgery with adhesions and they did something else in terms of repairing the bowel and he had a partial left nephrectomy in 2003 and that's what he was trying to say to you.

DOCTOR O721
That's what he was referring to okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
And also he was referring to he was first diagnosed with lung cancer in um 2003.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
But you know I wasn't present and he just didn't even, you know how guys are. He didn't think nothing of it when they were first talking about they saw some spots on his lungs.

DOCTOR O721
Right.

SECOND PERSON O721
But when they once they saw an obstruction was in July 2011 when he came in, when he became short of breath and they were suspicious of COPD.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And they was trying to, that's when they did the uh scans and all the x-rays and stuff that's when they saw the obstruction in the left lung and then when they did the CAT scan and all the other stuff that they did they came up with the lung uh CA and then they started staging it and they got the stage IV and they weren't able to proceed with the chemo, radiation at that time.

DOCTOR O721
@@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
So they went on with the palliative care and the Hospice care which has not brought him the comfort, that was one of the things it was supposed to do.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
But one of the things that has not happened, cause the pain is not controlled.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
And the new problem, I was going to let him express himself.

DOCTOR O721
Yeah, he seems to have some difficulty, but that's okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh they're not gonna see it.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
I wanted him to tell you because this stuff is subjective.  I want him to tell you what's going on with him.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And he did and I'm just, I'm just his wife, Iâ€™m just saying what I assess is that his pain is not controlled.

DOCTOR O721
Sure.

SECOND PERSON O721
And if the medicine is given every two hours, @@@ you know, take two or three pills every two hours.  Dilaudid is stronger than Vicodin.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And that is that's @@@ to me.

DOCTOR O721
What happens when he takes it, does he get like really knocked out or is he, does it seem to improve his pain or what happens when he takes the pills of the Dilaudid.

SECOND PERSON O721
What happens?

PATIENT O721
It knocks me out.

DOCTOR O721
It knocks out the pain?

PATIENT O721
Around 45 minutes, I don't know 50 uh @@@ at 1:00 it's just about gone now @@@.  Uh going on 45 minutes over and uh then it, you know I been going this long anyway.

SECOND PERSON O721
So one of the other problems that I assess is that we're gonna give him, he was taking Ativan.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
And um then they gave him an anti-anxiety medicine.

DOCTOR O721
Looks like they gave him Seroquel.

SECOND PERSON O721
And uh what is the other one, there's two of them?

DOCTOR O721
Olanzapine and Seroquel.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh olanzapine.  If he does not take the olanzapine.  He becomes very anxious, very, very anxious.

DOCTOR O721
And you have that at home or do you need more refills of it?

SECOND PERSON O721
But we need refills of that.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
I didn't give him the um @@@ the other one but the @@@.

DOCTOR O721
Oh that's the Seroquel.

SECOND PERSON O721
The Seroquel.

PATIENT O721
@@@.

DOCTOR O721
That's at night, that's the one at night.

SECOND PERSON O721
Right but.

PATIENT O721
But I need the hydrocodone, what is that one?

SECOND PERSON O721
Um this is the Dilaudid; I can't pronounce the other one.

PATIENT O721
Probenecid.

SECOND PERSON O721
He needs that but what.

DOCTOR O721
Well we could always go up to the patch too.  The patch is a low dose right now.

SECOND PERSON O721
Right it's 50.

DOCTOR O721
Right.

SECOND PERSON O721
It's at 50 and it's uh every uh every 17 hours.

DOCTOR O721
Can he stand up out of the chair?

PATIENT O721
@@@ uh the patch.

DOCTOR O721
Are you able to get up here?

PATIENT O721
Huh?

SECOND PERSON O721
Well why is he so anxious because he's got pain control?

DOCTOR O721
Yeah, well yeah I mean.

SECOND PERSON O721
Um he gets real angry and he's real upset.

DOCTOR O721
That could be it definitely.

SECOND PERSON O721
Is the medicine every two hours?  Isn't that too much?

DOCTOR O721
Um I mean it is a lot but it's all about getting his pain under control.  I mean if it isn't enough then he might have to take more you know.  

SECOND PERSON O721
So he takes, he could maybe take three pills every two hours.

DOCTOR O721
No, no, let me talk to my boss first and we'll decide what we're gonna do about, about the pain medications.  So he's also taking the, he's also taking the uh hydrocodone?

SECOND PERSON O721
@@@?

DOCTOR O721
Yeah that's uh the Norco or the Vicodin.

SECOND PERSON O721
No.  No, no, no, no, no.  He's not taking Vicodin.

PATIENT O721
Right there.

SECOND PERSON O721
He's taking the Dilaudid.

DOCTOR O721
He's taking Dilaudid @@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
Dilaudid and Fentanyl.

PATIENT O721
Yeah that's it.

DOCTOR O721
The Lidoderm, he's taking the Lidoderm.

SECOND PERSON O721
But he has to have the Ativan.

PATIENT O721
It only working two hours.

SECOND PERSON O721
The Ativan, what's this one pill called Zyprexa?

DOCTOR O721
Zyprexa um I think um I think that's the olanzapine.

SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah but he has to have the Ativan and he's just.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
So you think that we should take the um.

DOCTOR O721
Let me talk to my boss and see if we can give him Ativan um to ease the anxiety.  So and you guys talked about this with the hospice doctor, they don't want to give him Ativan or what's the problem?

SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah he gave the Ativan with the Zyprexa cause that's the only way he can face it or otherwise he's really anxious.

DOCTOR O721
So how come the hospice doctor isnâ€™t like giving him @@@ meds.

SECOND PERSON O721
He's on Ativan, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
He's on Ativan and um Zyprexa.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh I have to give to him together, but weâ€™re not giving it at QHS we were giving it, I give it uh at least twice a day cause they only ordered it once a day for sleep at night but that's not the case well the new problem is anxiety I got to give it more than once a day.  I have to give Ativan and Zyprexa.  I didn't give the other pill at all because I didn't, the one that you gave, I didn't give that.

DOCTOR O721
Okay Seroquel.

SECOND PERSON O721
Seroquel.  Only thing I give is the Zyprexa and I give Ativan cause he was taking Ativan before he was admitted on Christmas to the VA Hospital.

DOCTOR O721
Did the Hospice run out or is he still getting that at home?

SECOND PERSON O721
What?

DOCTOR O721
The Hospice care?

SECOND PERSON O721
He's still getting the Hospice care.

DOCTOR O721
So how come these meds are not getting titrated up like the Fentanyl and other pain meds, how come they're not doing that as part of Hospice?

SECOND PERSON O721
Theyâ€™re doing theâ€¦

PATIENT O721
No she have a meeting.  She comes to uh work on me but we having an appointment on the same day she come to see me she's telling us to talk to the doctor and get the medication.

DOCTOR O721
That's what she said at home hospice, to talk to the doctor.

SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah because she didn't have uh.

PATIENT O721
Yeah when I see her whatever.

DOCTOR O721

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
What she's saying is rather than her to order more medicines to go up here.

PATIENT O721

SECOND PERSON O721
Rather than us oh the other problem we had is constipation which is from the.

PATIENT O721
Hold on mother; hold off one thing @@@.

SECOND PERSON O721

SECOND PERSON O721
Take it off, take it off so he can see the.  Lay down so he can.

PATIENT O721

SECOND PERSON O721
If you lay down he'll see it.

DOCTOR O721
Just relax.

PATIENT O721

SECOND PERSON O721
Be still.

PATIENT O721
Huh?

DOCTOR O721
That hurts a lot?

PATIENT O721
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR O721
Yeah it does feel like a hernia.

SECOND PERSON O721
That's I'm here for.

DOCTOR O721
Could be an abdominal wall hernia.

PATIENT O721
It would go @@@ and hard cause I can feel it, feel it right there?

DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

PATIENT O721
Right there.

DOCTOR O721
Yeah.  That hurts?

PATIENT O721
Yeah, yeah, that, that hurt  Then it worse @@@.

DOCTOR O721
Take some deep breaths in let me hear.  Alright I mean I think it is a hernia. I don't think that um because of his other illnesses that they're gonna want to do surgery on this but we can definitely just try to control the pain for it.

SECOND PERSON O721
He's not a good candidate for.

DOCTOR O721
For surgery.

SECOND PERSON O721
And I mean this is what I assess.

DOCTOR O721
Right.  He would not be I don't think.

SECOND PERSON O721
I mean for me cause he's had tremendous weight loss since November.  I mean I'm always in tears cause we have to deal with this.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Because uh he's so thin.  I mean I donâ€™t know what to do.

DOCTOR O721
Are you eating enough?  Like what's going on?

PATIENT O721
I eat @@@.

DOCTOR O721
No appetite?

PATIENT O721
No my diet is @@@ you know so.

DOCTOR O721
Are you drinking Ensures and things like that?

PATIENT O721
Right.

SECOND PERSON O721
Hmm.

DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

PATIENT O721
I wanted to see, you know I've been.

SECOND PERSON O721
He wanted to see how thin he is.

DOCTOR O721
Yeah.  I don't see any ulcers here.

SECOND PERSON O721
It was bare skin where maybe it's @@@.

PATIENT O721
Oh that healed up, yeah that healed up.

DOCTOR O721
That's healed up.

SECOND PERSON O721
Can I say something, why such a tremendous weight loss?

DOCTOR O721
Because of the cancer.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh.

DOCTOR O721
That's what happens.

SECOND PERSON O721
Well whatever you want done for him.  The reason why I insisted I come back to the VA, whatever he got in December for those nine days, he wasn't eaten nothing.  He wasn't drinking much but when he came in here and they gave him all the IV therapy and they gave all the stuff they gave him.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Whatever they gave him.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
They had him on, they gave him a different electrolytes, now he's eating cause they told me the tumor was, uh the calcium was low or high it was.

DOCTOR O721
High.

SECOND PERSON O721
High the phosphorus was low or everything was off balance.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
So how long does it last?

DOCTOR O721
Well it's gonna last indefinitely um because of the cancer because the cancer is still there.

SECOND PERSON O721
No I'm talking about him being able to eat.  He wasn't doing nothing till he came in here that's why I insisted on coming back here even though Hospice @@@ at the house.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
He wasn't making any progress until he came here and had the.

DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
Do you know what I'm saying I think there?

DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
Does that make sense?

DOCTOR O721
Well we'll check the labs and see if everything's okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.  Can he go back to where he was in December?

DOCTOR O721
Well you know eventually we would expect that because the cancer is progressing he's not being treated so we would expect for that to happen.  The question is we don't know how long that will take for that to happen cause no one can know.  No cancer doctors, nobody can know.

SECOND PERSON O721
Well he wasn't eating until he came here.

DOCTOR O721
But now he's eating again right?

PATIENT O721
I don't gain no weight now.

SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah, well why can't you @@@ terrible to me.

PATIENT O721
That's all the exam, what we talking about now, what we gonna do about the pain pills, about the pain?

DOCTOR O721
Let me talk with my boss okay and we'll figure it out.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh do you want to look.  You see how @@@ once a month or something.

DOCTOR O721
I donâ€™t see a problem with that.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh you want this to go all the way down again?

DOCTOR O721
Yeah because now his calcium is low it looks like.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh it is hmm.

PATIENT O721
What's that now?

SECOND PERSON O721
I don't know nothing about it, I just put the book down I was trying to read, I stopped trying to be @@@, I'm just a basket case @@@ so I don't know.  I mean to me I don't know why you think Hospice is so hot.  You don't have a doctor when you have Hospice.  All of a sudden somebody's coming and giving you medicine but if they came in, so there's no trial stuff that he can get into no, you don't know.

DOCTOR O721
No. That's what, that's what would have been assessed in the Oncology appointment you had back like in August.

SECOND PERSON O721
Well we had, August 30th, I asked for a follow-up and they said he didn't need one so then the last hospitalization here at the VA I asked, I asked to speak with Oncology so I'm coming here this Thursday.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
I'm going to Oncology; this is because I asked for this.  I want to find out if it's something that they could do.  Cause I don't hold the Hospice philosophy.  Do you hear what I'm saying?

DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
Of comfort palliative care, I'm still hoping for a stage V which would offer something that ya'll have not been able to offer but whatever ya'll done for him in December I want to do over.  They told me to make sure I give the magnesium and the phosphorus so is that keeping up his appetite up and everything, you don't know?

DOCTOR O721
Yeah it sometimes can really affect that I mean it just keeps, it just keeps it replenished you know in the setting of not eating.  If he's eating better, let me talk to my boss and we'll see what we can do.  We can check his labs and things like that and see if we find anything.  I mean give him something for the constipation, get him something better for pain.

SECOND PERSON O721
Hmm.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.  

SECOND PERSON O721
What do you think the problem is?

PATIENT O721
But I got uh a suppositories that they sent me.

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O721
What's that?

SECOND PERSON O721
Suppositories.

DOCTOR O721
Suppositories okay.

PATIENT O721
We have them, @@@ and it's actually every day, every day, it doesn't and I ain't got no power to pull my urine, my bowel movement out.  The only thing to do it is just.

DOCTOR O721
We can give you something stronger definitely.

SECOND PERSON O721
Well what could you do for the hernia, you don't know?

DOCTOR O721
For the hernia the only thing that we could do right now is pain control, trying to get the pain under better control and to stimulate the bowel movements.

SECOND PERSON O721
They can't do no lasers or nothing?

DOCTOR O721
I mean we can refer to Surgery but because of all these other illnesses I seriously doubt if they would do surgery on him.

SECOND PERSON O721
They wouldn't do a CT scan or anything like that?

DOCTOR O721
They wouldn't do it because, what would they do if they find something.  If you have a hernia they're not going to do a surgery because he's a palliative patient.

SECOND PERSON O721
Alright.

DOCTOR O721
Does that make sense?  Do you understand why?

SECOND PERSON O721
I understand.

PATIENT O721
Yeah, yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah I understand.  Actually @@@.

PATIENT O721
Yeah why is that, I mean why?

DOCTOR O721
Because of the risk of doing a surgery in you, which is also going on in your body, the complication rate would be too high.  But if you want we can send you to the surgeons to talk with them about it if that's what you want.

SECOND PERSON O721
He's a high risk?

DOCTOR O721
Yes because of his cancer.

PATIENT O721
High risk of what?

DOCTOR O721
Of the complications of something bad happening.

PATIENT O721
@@@ or something?

DOCTOR O721
No that if they try to repair the hernia that you would end up being in the hospital on a ventilator for the rest of your life basically.  Just because of a hernia which would really drastically um, it would basically drastically mess up his, um quality of life.

PATIENT O721
You can't give me, so the doctor say you give me some @@@ pills then.

SECOND PERSON O721
So he his abdominal discomfort and pain, but he has not complained of chest pain.  Oh we forgot to tell him, he has a cough now, a productive cough.

DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And he has green sputum that he's coughing up.

DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Is that from the lungs?

DOCTOR O721
Probably.  It's coming from the lung cancer.

SECOND PERSON O721
He's never had that before.

DOCTOR O721
I mean it's probably from the worsening, from the lung cancer taking its course.

SECOND PERSON O721
But his um oxygen stuff is.

DOCTOR O721
He's doing okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
It's okay but he's very confused, gets very anxious and if ya'll can't do laser nothing, I mean you have so much modern stuff.

DOCTOR O721
Let me talk to my boss and then I'll come back and see what she thinks okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Alright.

DOCTOR O721
I'll ask her and see what she thinks okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.

DOCTOR O721
I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  49:12  DOCTOR IN:  62:45)

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Hi there.  Hi PATIENT how are you?

PATIENT O721
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Hi PATIENT I'm DOCTOR.  I don't think we've met before.  I'm one of the medicine doctors here.  I'm working with DOCTOR and he, I went over the medical records with him um a little bit so I kind of have been a little more familiarized with um PATIENT's health condition.  I know that a lot of things have been concerning you, one being he's in a lot of pain from the hernia um or what seems to be a hernia and you're just wanting follow up from his recent hospitalization is that right?
SECOND PERSON O721
Uh somewhat.

PATIENT O721
Yes, yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay so when you, I know that Oncology and you know different services have talked to you both about Hospice.  What does Hospice mean for you?  Cause you know I want to know what exactly are the appropriate management points we need to focus on.  Some people are really only focused on being comfortable at home.  Other people want more done.  So what are, what did you all discuss with your Oncology doctors about Hospice?

SECOND PERSON O721
@@@ to.

PATIENT O721
Yeah I think @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
And I noticed that you donâ€™t have diabetes or blood pressure, those things have all been stopped, really it's just pain medicine right now.

PATIENT O721
Yeah, I have this thing.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
That's really causing you a lot of pain?

PATIENT O721
Yeah I be alright; it's just that I was doing fine, this right here.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

PATIENT O721
This here, this is going back and forth, back and forth, as long as it's back and forth and pain.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah let me see here.

PATIENT O721
Feel it?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah right in here.

PATIENT O721
Hurts.  Along with this, right there yeah @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Have you had recent imaging of his abdomen?  So yeah the question would be the only way to repair those, if it is in fact a hernia which it appears to be, is the surgical approach.  I don't know that they're gonna want to do anything surgically um.

SECOND PERSON O721
What @@@?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Huh?

SECOND PERSON O721
What @@@?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
I don't know.  I mean it could just be pain medication cause right now.

SECOND PERSON O721
When you say they you know I want you to identify they.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Anybody, anyone, I don't know that anyone would operate because he's a very high risk um of not doing well.

SECOND PERSON O721
What would make him be um high risk?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Being a stage IV cancer patient he's a high risk.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.  What Iâ€™m saying to you is that he's very, very uncomfortable.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Oh yeah, I want you to ask.

SECOND PERSON O721
He can express himself.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
Because he's the patient and I can't express his subjective feelings.  Now I can tell you what I think.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
As his caretaker.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And his wife and living with him consistently during his whole experience.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
No I understand, I know what you mean.

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh illness.  No I'm gonna tell you what I think.  I think that his pain is not controlled.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
I think that um.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Hold on second, Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m listening, Iâ€™m just trying to read his last scan.

SECOND PERSON O721
See when he left the hospital he did not have uh this problem that he's got now so would you think it would be reasonable for him to have another scan?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
He's probably gonna need some kind of imaging if this is new.

SECOND PERSON O721
This is new; this is what I'm trying to tell you.  While he was hospitalized on December 25th to January the 2nd or something.  I think he was here until January 2nd, uh he did not have a problem that I am and that he is expressing you.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
With the left belly pain.

SECOND PERSON O721
Right.  Left abdominal pain.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
He didn't have the hernia.  It wasn't as large and protruding as it is now.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Or I would've said something and he would've said something.  I try to allow him to, he's the patient, I'm just somebody that's in the family.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
I'm just his wife.  I don't have his pain, that's why I want him to express himself.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Usually the patients are pretty good @@@.  I'm sorry I clicked it off.

SECOND PERSON O721
So I'll stop talking so ya'll.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Well you know, it sounds like, when did you last see your cancer doctors, out of curiosity, because the last note I could find was August.  Has it been that long?

SECOND PERSON O721
And while we were in the hospital, the last time we saw Oncology cancer people.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Was August @@, @@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
We had one appointment, we talked to someone that pulled up the computer and told us the results.  Can you hear me with all that rattling?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
No I can hear you, go ahead I'm listening.

SECOND PERSON O721
So on August the 30th she didn't examine my husband.  All that she did was told him the results.  She had never seen him before.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
The PET scan.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
That was done at VA Jesse Brown Hospital.  She told him the results of the PET scan, where the cancer, how it was staged and how it had mets spread and to what areas of the body as to what, ribs and bones and so with that and I asked could I have a follow-up appointment with Surgery, would that be curative, and she said no.  I asked if we'd have chemotherapy and she said no.  I asked if we'd have radiation therapy.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
And she said no and then my husband asked her.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Cause it didn't help yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
My husband asked her if he could have surgery in terms of removing the tumor and she said it was 3.2 it was located so close to his heart that.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh it would be very dangerous.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah I saw that.

SECOND PERSON O721
And then he asked her again.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
I'm trying to tell you what happened.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.  I have read all of this already yeah.  I did read it yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay I'm trying to tell you what happened.  He asked her again how we don't understand.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Could they surgically remove the um tumor.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And she said that uh they couldn't because of the location of the tumor.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Right uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
So then while he was hospitalized, Iâ€™m getting so long-winded, while he was here from December 25th to January 2nd, I asked them if we could talk with Oncology.  I didn't know if we could get involved with some trial studies, medicine or anything.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And uh they said that they weren't because of the holidays able to get an appointment but once he was discharged they would try to get an appointment.  When they gave him an appointment it was a snow storm @@@ to go on a Thursday.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON O721
And I couldn't take my husband out in a snowstorm.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
So I made another appointment for this week which is Thursday.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh at to see Oncology, I don't know.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So you have one on Thursday?

SECOND PERSON O721
I have an appointment at 8:45 for Oncology that I made for this week but I don't know what they'll be able to do.  If they don't examine him I'll be very irate.



SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
I will be very upset if they don't even examine him.  What I don't like, can I say this, I hate for people to just conclude.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
I hate waiting, I hate for people to just, can I finish, give up and that's what Iâ€™m feeling.  When Hospice comes to your home, the reason why I don't like their philosophy, they're coming in in terms of treating the symptoms.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
In terms of saying well we don't do this yet.  So far they have not been able to control the pain.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And make PATIENT, my husband, comfortable.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.  Are you finished or do you still have something you want to tell me?

SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah I want to tell you that uh he's so thin, he's had such tremendous weight loss that I was wondering is it possible for them to give him some type of donut or something?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah @@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
Right, well I mean I guess it'll come from Hospice, I don't know if it'll come from the VA Hospice.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
This donut cause he's so, he started getting a decubitus.  It was just, it wasn't even 1 centimeter, it was like half of a centimeter or something.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Does he have one now?  A decubitus?

SECOND PERSON O721
On his coccyx area.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
But what happens that, it was just like a skin break.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
We'll look at it.

SECOND PERSON O721
And uh they, they put a dressing to it before he left the hospital and I don't know if it's showing up on the computer now and so but if you have these donuts or stuff would that help?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Probably not.

SECOND PERSON O721
No.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
The donuts don't help decubitus ulcers.  We'll take a look at it.

SECOND PERSON O721
Maybe it'll help in the wheelchair.

PATIENT O721
It might not do anything @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
We'll look at it and then I'll let you know what I think okay.  But to address the initial part of your conversation, so what I estimate and again we don't know all the in's and out's of what's going on here, having just met your husband but from what I saw being able to know the source of it.

SECOND PERSON O721
You feel that.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
From what I was able to, what's going on with you @@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
I've got water but I.  Here honey, you want this for your medicine, come on honey.

PATIENT O721
And my throat @@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
Honey I can't do this now, that's too hard.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
@@@.

PATIENT O721
I mean it's nothing.

SECOND PERSON O721
I don't @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
@@@.

PATIENT O721
I can't even get no @@@ no.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
@@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
Come on take some water.

PATIENT O721
Get it out of here.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
@@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
Don't call her @@@.

PATIENT O721
I don't see no privacy.

(First and second doctors discuss patient between them)

SECOND PERSON O721
Here, here we go.  Okay you've got it.  Thank you very much.  Sorry @@@ bad you know.  I'll fix it.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay so essentially I think that what's going on here is that you're clearly frustrated cause you feel like people aren't properly um addressing all of the concerns that you have.  All of the pain that your husband's having.  

SECOND PERSON O721
That's not true, that's not true okay.  

SECOND DOCTOR O721
You're not frustrated.  

SECOND PERSON O721
First of all I think they're doing everything.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
I'm very pleased and satisfied with Hospice, itâ€™s not their fault that they have not been able to control.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
The pain, they've tried everything.  I'm not frustrated about anything.  I'm just haven't gave up.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
No one can make me give up.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Let me finish, because otherwise we're probably not gonna make much progress here.  I understand that this is a very, this is a very difficult time and it's a very difficult situation.  It sounds like, from Oncology's perspective, they know that just from all of the data they have and from evaluating your husband they know from their estimation, their experience that there is nothing more that they feel they can do.  Now if he wants to see them again and re-address that issue I think that's a good idea and it sounds like you already have that plan so that's one thing.  I could not speak more on that.  I'm not a cancer doctor.

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
I don't have an educated opinion about that beyond what it appears is this is a non-surgical situation um and you know if they think he's too weak for chemo or there's no appropriate trials out there they're the best ones to speak to that.  Now as far as pain goes yeah, if he's not getting adequate pain control then we need to keep working on that.  Um he's got a palliative doctor who's seeing him for pain control, is that correct or not?

SECOND PERSON O721
We don't @@@

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay who prescribed his pain medicines right now?

SECOND PERSON O721
Um VA did and then Hospice.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.  So we probably.

SECOND PERSON O721
Is that the palliative doctor, what's the?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
(Doctor asks the first doctor to look something up in the computer)

SECOND PERSON O721
So is that the doctor from the VA or is it the doctor from Hospice I'm never.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Probably Hospice.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh it is.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Um let's, we're looking.

SECOND PERSON O721
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
(Doctors are checking the computer and discussing this between them)  See if we have, do you know the name of the person prescribing the pain medicine the?

SECOND PERSON O721
I can spell his name.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Would that help?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Um it might, who?

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh, uh before he came into the hospital uh the Hospice doctor, his name was DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Is that, I think it's something like that.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Because really what we'd have to do, just so that we.

SECOND PERSON O721
I'm not sure.  I never saw him or talked to him.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
The only person I've ever seen is the uh the nurse, you know manager.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
And who's that?

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh his nurse manager her name is NAME.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.  So maybe, what, the best thing we could probably do is to try to get a hold of the people who are actually prescribing the pain medicines right now; I'll let them know we need to make some adjustments.  We could @@@ entering them in but we probably need to work with you know, have a discussion with them about it and let them know that he's not getting adequate pain control.  Now let me be specific in terms of understanding how he's not getting adequate control.  PATIENT are you ever at a point where you're feeling like your pain is being well controlled or do you always have pain?

PATIENT O721
Um what they doing is they giving these.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O721
And it cuts me out; it cuts me off two hours.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So you have a two hour period where before you can take it again you've got pain?

PATIENT O721
I got pain.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay so before that two hours, youâ€™re doing okay?

PATIENT O721
Less than the two hours.
SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

PATIENT O721
When it come I have some pain.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

PATIENT O721
But.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

PATIENT O721
It's kind of rough on it and we have to call, whoever we got to call.  I'm not going.

SECOND PERSON O721
They say @@@.

PATIENT O721
Pay no mind.

SECOND PERSON O721
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
@@@.  Well this said you can take it every two hours.

PATIENT O721
That's all I said, two tablets in two hours.

SECOND PERSON O721
That didn't come from Hospice that came from VA.

PATIENT O721
VA gave me that.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
But you can take two tablets every two hours then @@@.

PATIENT O721
Right @@@ price you know I mean I call in for the patches and all of this is higher than what the VA is giving me.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
No uh we don't mind.  You can get it through the VA.

PATIENT O721
I know you see but she is saying, when she calls the VA it's gonna be more.  I @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Right now we're trying to figure out what's gonna give you pain relief so like, the money.

SECOND PERSON O721
The VA, the VA gave him.

PATIENT O721
VA right here.

SECOND PERSON O721
The Dilaudid.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
He was on Vicodin until he came in here @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So how are we doing on the Dilaudid, along with the Fentanyl patch?

PATIENT O721
Fine, fine.

SECOND PERSON O721
Fine but, but he's doing okay but he has an anxiety problem and VA has said discontinue Ativan, we had to get the Ativan back from his Hospice um.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
So now he's on Zyprexa and Ativan.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay but now we're going off on a tangent.  Let's focus on the pain first and then we can talk about another topic.  The pain is controlled with the Fentanyl patch and the Dilaudid that he's getting through the VA yes?

SECOND PERSON O721
PATIENT?  Cause I can't feel your pain.

PATIENT O721
All I know is what happenings here.

SECOND PERSON O721
For 45 minutes, that's what he's saying.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
There's only @@@ it lasts about 45 minutes.

SECOND PERSON O721
45 minutes so is that controlled I don't know.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So once he takes this for 45 minutes he's good and then it starts again.

SECOND PERSON O721
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
With just Dilaudid with two pills.

SECOND PERSON O721
Every two hours so if that 45 minutes or maybe it might be a little longer, maybe it's controlled for a hour but what I was saying to you is he has to have an anxiety pill.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
More than once a day but VA was the one that gave him that anxiety medicine but instead of once a day we had to give it twice.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
The Zyprexa?

SECOND PERSON O721
Zyprexa or he becomes very anxious.  I thought that it was very important for you to know.  He's anxious because of his pain.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.  I don't know, can you look up.

SECOND PERSON O721
So is it possible to take it twice a day?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
The Zyprexa, let me look it up, I honestly couldn't tell you.  It's not a medication I really prescribe.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh okay.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
It's fine every 12 hours.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
The Zyprexa, it says you can take it twice a day, the way it's written here.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay well okay.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So that should be okay.  Now as far as the Dilaudid, now a half-life should be from one to two hours so theoretically.

SECOND PERSON O721
It's okay.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
I'm wondering if we could change this to one to two hours.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Um.  (Doctor asks first doctor to look something up on the computer and they discuss patient)  So we're gonna look it up and I'll see if we can change it but really it's a discussion that needs to be had with whoever's controlling his pain but since I don't know how to get a hold of that person we can at least try to get you enough before they're gonna come, when do they contact you normally?

SECOND PERSON O721
Um they come, uh they come and see us every.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Two weeks?

SECOND PERSON O721
No every, uh twice a week.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Oh okay so when did you last see them?

PATIENT O721
Last Friday so they supposed to be Tuesday, today, but we had to come down here on appointment.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay so they probably.

PATIENT O721
And Fridays, Tuesday and Fridays.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
And how do you contact them?

SECOND PERSON O721
They came last Tuesday; Friday they did not come she called though.  But they're in constant contact.  I don't have no problem with them.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
And you don't have a number?  No, no, I know.  Thatâ€™s not what I mean, so we can contact them.  Do you have a way?

SECOND PERSON O721
If you want to.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Oh, they have a number.

SECOND PERSON O721
I can answer you, NUMBER.  I'm giving the direct number to my nurse manager.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
@@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
NUMBER.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay hold on, this pen is not working.

SECOND PERSON O721
Just write it down, NUMBER.  The nurse manager's name is NAME.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay I will call them.

SECOND PERSON O721
That's I only have one nurse, it's the nurse manager.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So these people okay why don't we just talk to them.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So then we'll talk to them about the hernia too because really I don't know that anyone's gonna feel like it's a good idea for him being weak and having this stage of cancer cause the only way to treat a hernia like this is surgically.  So um.

SECOND PERSON O721
They can't reduce no other kind of way?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
No there's no other way to, I mean it reduces on it's own but the only way to keep it gone is doing surgery.

SECOND PERSON O721
And do you know why it came, I mean this hernia.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Um you know he could have.  Has he ever had surgery, it looks like he had surgery on his abdomen before.

SECOND PERSON O721
Yes, July of 2011.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
Last year.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So wherever he had surgery before that part of the wall of the abdomen is probably a little weaker and thinner so it creates an area where it's vulnerable for other organs like bowels to poke through.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh okay.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So.

SECOND PERSON O721
Wearing a belly band or something that don't help I mean wearing an um.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
I don't know that it's gonna make a huge difference here because it's not that big but it's clearly its causing pain so let me talk to the Hospice nurse too.  I don't mind referring him to Surgery to see what they have to say.  I just don't know what they're gonna offer him so I don't mind you talking to them and then they can tell you what they think um I just, by my estimation I'm not sure that they would feel it was safe for him to go through a surgery that's not a life-saving type surgery for a hernia you know so we wouldn't want to possibly do more harm than good for something that wasn't absolutely necessary.  Now if they look at it as well, keeping him comfortable is what we're trying to do and he's not comfortable maybe they'd be willing to, I honestly don't know so we can put in the referral and find out.

SECOND PERSON O721
With lung cancer are you supposed to, my question to you, have abdominal pain?  He's been having abdominal pain for six months.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
From the hernia?

SECOND PERSON O721
Right where's he's telling you now.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah from the hernia.  This isn't the cancer this is the hernia.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay well that's where his pain is.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Right.

SECOND PERSON O721
And nothing in his chest.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
But what I'm saying is.

SECOND PERSON O721
So that's not from the cancer it's from the hernia.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
No it's from the hernia.  Where he's pointing to is the hernia.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay so let's just go on and talk to the @@@ guy or let me look at your backside first okay.  You know your wife told me you had that ulcer.  Do you mind if I look at it?  I'm gonna just grab some gloves first okay.  Let me squeeze past you here.

PATIENT O721
Now look at what, what are you looking at?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Um.

SECOND PERSON O721
Yes, that's alright, no skin breakdown.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
No skin breakdown.  Like stage 1, just a little erythema?

SECOND PERSON O721
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So usually how we dress those is just a transparent dressing and then.

SECOND PERSON O721
Well when he was in the hospital they, he was here in the VA a month ago, they was putting a dressing on it and he was bleeding and the skin had broke down so maybe.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
He looks pretty good.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay how we usually either prevent further worsening.

SECOND PERSON O721
Because of his thinness.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah what we would probably do is recommend things like a hospital type bed.  He probably needs to have one of those.  Frequent turning, you know good nutrition, all those things.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Um because otherwise you know obviously if he's running down a lot he's at risk for developing you know.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh I see.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Further ones or getting this one to advance.  So I mean we could at least put in a referral.

SECOND PERSON O721
Uh you know we didn't come today because of his pain we're just saying that he's uncomfortable.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
I understand.

SECOND PERSON O721
Because of the um, but he's been having this, he's been having, this is what I'm asking you.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
I guess people don't listen.  He's been like this for what six months.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Right.

SECOND PERSON O721
So if it's not from the cancer.

PATIENT O721
Now why don't you let her talk?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Like I said it's from the hernia.

PATIENT O721
Now that's all, I just want you to call her since my medication, I don't know if these people can give me some.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So we're gonna refer you to a doctor for your hernia.

PATIENT O721
@@@ anything you can do about the hernia.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
I believe this is the hernia causing the pain, not the cancer.

PATIENT O721
No it ain't the cancer, if it would the other side would be.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah.

PATIENT O721
No it's not the cancer.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
So he does not have any cancer in his abdomen from what we were able to see so this is not the cancer causing this pain.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh he gave us NicoDerm patches.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yes.

SECOND PERSON O721
She said that they didn't provide them, the VA gave it to them so when we came over here the nurse I talked to her twice today, she said make sure that we ask for the NicoDerm.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Yeah we can't write for those, we'll have to refer him cause they won't let us write for those.

SECOND PERSON O721
But they gave it to us when he left the hospital.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
I understand they can in the hospital but they can't on an outpatient basis.  It's just the VA @@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay can I say something to you, cause I see you didn't hear me.  When he left here on discharge they gave him NicoDerm.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
I understand that.  I cannot write for it as an outpatient doctor.  They can do that as an inpatient doctor.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
I understood what you said.

SECOND PERSON O721
The Lidoderm either?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
The Lidoderm we also cannot do.  So we can try to find out how to get them, that's what we're gonna do.

SECOND PERSON O721
Are you angry?

SECOND DOCTOR O721
No I'm not angry but I just, you're telling me that I'm not listening but I've heard everything you've said.  I just want you to realize that I still can't do it.  All I can do is try to find out how we can facilitate fully and that's what we're gonna do.

SECOND PERSON O721
The nurse is the one that gave me these directions; I talked to her twice this morning.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Sure.

SECOND PERSON O721
She told me to ask for the NicoDerm.  She told me to ask for the Lidoderm.  She told me to ask for um all the medicine.  Everything I'm saying.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
I got directives from my Hospice nurse.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Okay.

PATIENT O721
They're just watching over me, @@@ giving it back.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
I know they @@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay. The nurse um told me to ask for this.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
Sure I understand.

PATIENT O721
I'm ready to go, I @@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
Why are you ready to go?

PATIENT O721
Cause I'm hurting, man I been hurting, let's just go.

SECOND PERSON O721
But you just took @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR O721
@@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
He just took the medicine.  @@@ kick in @@@ 30 minutes or 45?  

FIRST DOCTOR O721
It should @@@ kick in @@@ like that, 35-40 minutes.  

SECOND DOCTOR O721
He's taken the medicine twice since he's been here.  I really don't want @@@.

PATIENT O721
Almost 12 o'clock.

SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah.

PATIENT O721
I'll wait till 1 o'clock.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.

PATIENT O721
2 o'clock is an hour.

SECOND PERSON O721
@@@.

PATIENT O721
2 o'clock is two.

SECOND PERSON O721
And you took two, well that's four pills he's taken since he's been here right?  Two before you left home, that's six pills, so that's why you gonna change it to every one to two hours.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Yeah.  Uh we're gonna put that in.

PATIENT O721
Hours.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
@@@ doing.

PATIENT O721
Two uh.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
So let's give them a call to see if we can find out what they've been doing and then um.

SECOND PERSON O721
They call the VA.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
The thing is, we donâ€™t want to be giving um, we don't want to be giving; we want to find out so we're not all giving a bunch of different regimens.  We want to have one regimen for him.  Okay we're giving you one thing and they're giving something else.

SECOND PERSON O721
I see.  When um when he was discharged I gave the nurse the computer sheet that they give you when you leave the hospital.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And she followed everything that um, she was the one that told the VA had wrote down for me cause he was on Vicodin so the VA changed it to Dilaudid, not Hospice.  Only thing that we have changed was he needs his Ativan or he can't function.  He has to have that.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
So how come, how come they're not prescribing it at home then?

SECOND PERSON O721
They are.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
So they are prescribing it, so he doesn't need that cause you guys have it right?

SECOND PERSON O721
We have the Ativan.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Okay so you don't need the Ativan.

SECOND PERSON O721
No.  The VA had said discontinue the Ativan cause they were giving Zyprexa but he has to take the Zyprexa and the Ativan so I don't give this other Seroquel because I'm giving Ativan you know good with some food and I'm giving Zyprexa so I have not gave the Seroquel.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
But that's what I was trying to tell her.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
That's because you don't want to over medicate him or just so you can have it @@@.

SECOND PERSON O721
I have never gave all of it.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
You've never tried to give all of them?

SECOND PERSON O721
No, no.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Well, they act differently.

SECOND PERSON O721
Well because one is an anti-psychotic and one is what anti-anxiety.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Yes.  One is anti-psychotic and one is anti-anxiolytic.  

SECOND PERSON O721
The Zyprexa is the anti-psychotic.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Right.

SECOND PERSON O721
The Seroquel is anti-psychotic right?  It's for PTSD, his PTSD.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Right, right.

SECOND PERSON O721
That's what the Seroquel is for and the Zyprexa is just given for anti-psychotic.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
It's usually given at night for insomnia.

SECOND PERSON O721
Insomnia.  But he takes it twice a day with the Ativan together.  When I give him one I give the other.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Hmm. Alright so we'll have the labs checked.  You can go over to the Laboratory after this.

SECOND PERSON O721
Yeah I came for the visit so I just wanted his electrolytes @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
So I'll be back down.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Of course and in terms of the um the constipation, is he taking the Docusate or is he out of that?

SECOND PERSON O721
He's got all of his, he's got the suppositories and what he don't have, she told me to write everything down so we can talk about it, he don't have the, I'm not frustrated about anything.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
I just didn't want him to go; he was in bad shape when he came in here on Christmas.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
I didn't want him to get back like that again um.  He's taking the um, he needs the patch for smoking NicoDerm, he needs the Lidoderm patch.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
So the Lidoderm patch I don't see in here so we have to call them to find out what's going on with that.

SECOND PERSON O721
Right and um he needs the um Fentanyl patch and you were saying to and then increase it to 100 instead of 50 or just wait @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
She's gonna manage the pain stuff and she's calling over to the nurse that you're talking about.  So she's gonna take care of that.

SECOND PERSON O721
That's been his nurse for the last five months so.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
We get a lot of medicines so, all his medicines this nurse didn't prescribe VA prescribed so um but we been coming here so much, we came in here.  I'm glad ya'll are gonna do the labs to see where he is, bloodwork, so his calcium won't be real high or low or whatever and he doesn't get real sick like he was Christmas.  I spent Christmas at VA Hospital and New Year's.  I was here for nine days so.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
I don't want him to get back in that shape if they could catch it.  I mean would the VA Hospital allow him to get the IV therapy or they don't do that?

FIRST DOCTOR O721
For what though?

SECOND PERSON O721
His electrolyte imbalance.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Well we don't know what his electrolytes are.

SECOND PERSON O721
I'm saying if he became imbalanced like he was Christmas would they put him in the hospital here.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Um if it was bad enough yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
Cause he was real bad when he um came in here Christmas.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Oh if it was bad enough they would just put him in.  

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh he can't sit up too long like he just, he'll get real tired.  That's why he's laying down now he gets real tired.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Okay.

SECOND PERSON O721
Real easy.  Is it anemia or something?  I mean if it could.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
It could be from fatigue from the cancer itself, that happens.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh okay.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
It makes him tired.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh the cancer makes him tired.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
It can yeah.

SECOND PERSON O721
Do you think I'm frustrating because I'm asking questions?  Is it not allowed to ask questions?

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Oh no, you can ask questions I mean that's fine.

SECOND PERSON O721
I'm not trying to, I'm not frustrated about anything, I'm just trying to find out uh what you all can do, what I can do for my husband, the patient.  You know is there something wrong with that?

FIRST DOCTOR O721
No.  

SECOND PERSON O721
But she said I was frustrated.  I am not frustrated.  I'm just trying to find out is there something I can do.  I got 17 grandkids and I'll be asking are you hungry, if you say you don't want eggs then I'll ask them do you want waffles or does you want cold cereal or you want orange juice or do you want nothing and so that's saying something.  I'm doing the same thing here I'm asking what can we do as a team trying to work for the patient, PATIENT.  That's the only thing I'm asking, is that allowed?

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Of course it's allowed, of course it's allowed.

SECOND PERSON O721
I'm just not in a hammock, she can't make me get in a hammock â€“ - Iâ€™m just resting - I had a patient once cause I worked in health care.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
And I had a patient once and uh I was coming to work, I was working at 11 to 7 and when I got to my facility where I was working.  I had on some pink house shoes cause I didn't want to be late cause I'd been @@@ supervisor so when I walked in to make my rounds the patient reached out for my hot chocolate.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721
Cause they had gave this patient up and they had said oh, you know but I was kinda @@@.  You know when you work 11 to 7 it look like you're in a different world, we never get enough rest.  But I was a supervisor so I had to make rounds and we gave him the hot chocolate and they had said this patient wasnâ€™t @@@.  This patient happily told the doctor @@@ and he said it was alright to.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON O721

FIRST DOCTOR O721

SECOND PERSON O721

FIRST DOCTOR O721

SECOND PERSON O721

FIRST DOCTOR O721

FIRST DOCTOR O721

SECOND PERSON O721
But I worked in health care long time, 40 years.

FIRST DOCTOR O721

SECOND PERSON O721

FIRST DOCTOR O721

FIRST DOCTOR O721

She's going to continue to order them for him but we're going to try to get them ordered here.  I have to speak with the pharmacist but he's not available at this time yet but I'll speak with her and if we can get it then we'll have it mailed.  Um.

SECOND PERSON O721
They always say that and then they donâ€™t.

I've never drove, it that believable?  All the things I've done in this life I've never drove a car.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON O721
So I can't get back over to the VA.  The VA has made promises and they ainâ€™t kept them @@@ so they not gonna send these patches, they not been lying to me are they?

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Well we're gonna try.  It's a question of whether it's approved.

SECOND PERSON O721
Oh.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Or not so the pharmacist is gonna assess whether he can get approved for it.

SECOND PERSON O721
You can't find out today?

FIRST DOCTOR O721
No I'm not, I mean I don't think she's not in her office right now and I have two more patients to see before 5 o'clock and so I can't, I can't go chasing after her all I can do is get in touch with her when sheâ€™s available.

SECOND PERSON O721

FIRST DOCTOR O721
No I tried to look for her just now, she's not there so I'll definitely get in touch with her and we'll try to get those two, the Lidoderm and the nicotine.  The other ones I could try, I could get right now.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.  @@@.  

FIRST DOCTOR O721
So she is in the system right now so I can't do anything so all I could say is um.

SECOND PERSON O721
Why she can't give him today?  If she's in the system.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Well I don't know where she is, I mean she's gonna have you know give you a call to tell you guys to come get them, or she'll have to mail them.  So in terms of the Dilaudid, I can't get in the system right now because she's in it so what we're gonna have to do is um if you can come up like tomorrow and pick it up from the Pharmacy.

PATIENT O721
No we live too far.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
Then it'll have to be mailed.

PATIENT O721
Uh can't we just wait outside until?

FIRST DOCTOR O721
You can wait outside and eventually when she's logged out of the system I could try to go back in and then get it so you could pick it up today.

SECOND PERSON O721
You can't get his pain medicines?

FIRST DOCTOR O721
I can't even; it's all I'm locked out right now because she's putting in the orders.  So if you guys want to hang out I can try to log back in once the pharmacist is out of the system and you can possibly get the medication today.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay we'll wait.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
You want to hang around?

SECOND PERSON O721

FIRST DOCTOR O721
No problem.

SECOND PERSON O721
We'll leave it here, this don't take but like five minutes for the laboratory okay.  Give me my pen.

FIRST DOCTOR O721
It might take a little longer to get in the system though so you may have to wait a little bit for the Dilaudid to get filled.

SECOND PERSON O721
Okay.  I'd rather wait than try to wait for the mail or trying to come back over cause I live on the south side and this is the west side @@@.  Okay thanks for waiting on us.
