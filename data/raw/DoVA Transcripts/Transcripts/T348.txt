Pretty much.  It's not every time but it's.

DOCTOR T348
And there's just so many @@@ of passing out.  Is it because you don't eat or?

PATIENT T348
No, they only draw the blood and then about two minutes later then I pass out.

DOCTOR T348
Okay.

PATIENT T348

DOCTOR T348
Yeah.

PATIENT T348
All of a sudden.

SECOND PERSON T348
This happened @@@.

PATIENT T348
So the last time I was in.

SECOND PERSON T348
The last time it was @@@.

PATIENT T348
Yeah the last time it was terrible.

SECOND PERSON T348
This is why I came today.

PATIENT T348
Because then I pass out for like five minutes and stuff like that.

DOCTOR T348
Okay.

PATIENT T348
And that's why they rolled me down to the ER because I didn't wake up right away.

SECOND PERSON T348
Maybe they can elevate his feet.

DOCTOR T348
Yeah maybe.

PATIENT T348
Whatever.  That's just why I don't like it very much.

DOCTOR T348
Okay.  Okay.  Let me listen to your heart and lungs.  What did you do your thesis on?

PATIENT T348
Uh graphite and diamonds.

DOCTOR T348

DOCTOR T348
Chemist okay.

PATIENT T348
So yeah.

DOCTOR T348
And do you smoke?

PATIENT T348
No.

DOCTOR T348
Drink or anything like that?

PATIENT T348
I don't smoke.  The only time I drink is like maybe once a month @@@.

DOCTOR T348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T348
So.  Very occasionally.

DOCTOR T348
No illicit drug use?

PATIENT T348
Nope.

SECOND PERSON T348
He @@@.

PATIENT T348
Well this is an intereting case study.  What do you get after you write a thesis?

DOCTOR T348
Any kids at home?

PATIENT T348
None.

SECOND PERSON T348
@@@ before your thesis @@@.

PATIENT T348
Oh they have, they have @@@ yeah.

SECOND PERSON T348
They have the formula.  They have a formula.

PATIENT T348
Yeah this at the Ph.D. Program.

DOCTOR T348
What do you not like about the chlorthalidone?  

PATIENT T348
Uh it causes erectile dysfunction so.

DOCTOR T348
Okay.

PATIENT T348
It was because of that yeah, absolutely.  Uh the other thing is it will make me slightly dizzy on occasion and uh let's see what else.  I think it also just made me feel generally bad.  I don't to say like depressive but not feel, like low energy I guess.

DOCTOR T348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T348
Is the way I'd describe it.

SECOND PERSON T348
@@@.

DOCTOR T348
I'll talk to DOCTOR; he's one of the attending physicians here.  But I'm thinking we'll probably restart you on some of your blood pressure medicines and have you follow up with the nurse for a blood pressure check okay.  Um.

PATIENT T348
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR T348
So we could always put you on the hydrochlorothiazide if you like that better than the chlorthalidone.

PATIENT T348
Yeah definitely that was better than the chlorthalidone.

DOCTOR T348
Okay.

SECOND PERSON T348
Oh yeah and is there any @@@ Nephrology people or do you need that?

PATIENT T348
@@@ they generally like to have.

DOCTOR T348
Chemistry.

PATIENT T348
Yeah.

DOCTOR T348
@@@.

PATIENT T348
But I'll try to set up, yeah a urine sample for the nephrectomy.

DOCTOR T348
Okay.

PATIENT T348
I'm supposed to see those guys like next month or something.  Based on @@@.

DOCTOR T348
Yeah.  Okay, I'll be right back.

DOCTOR OUT:  13:25   DOCTOR IN:  25:24

DOCTOR T348
Alright.  @@@.  I'm gonna start you again on the hydrochlorothiazide, not the chlorthalidone.

PATIENT T348
Okay.

DOCTOR T348
Uh and you can get a combo pill, your Losartan is a combo pill, just give you one pill.  And I think okay.  So whenever you get your blood drawn, ask if you can lie down completely.

PATIENT T348
Yeah, so I figure @@@.

DOCTOR T348
But just tell them @@@ ooh every sit.

SECOND PERSON T348
@@@.

DOCTOR T348
Just ask if you can lie down before and then once you're done give yourself a couple minutes and then get up.

PATIENT T348
Yeah I think that's probably the wise idea.

DOCTOR T348
Yeah.

PATIENT T348
So lame.

SECOND PERSON T348
It really bothers him.

DOCTOR T348
Okay I'll put you on the hydrochlorothiazide take 25 and the Losartan you were taking 100.

PATIENT T348
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T348
So you just take two pills so there's a combo pill that has both your medicines in it and you just take two pills of that in the morning.

SECOND PERSON T348
So you take it, the dose is two pills.

PATIENT T348
The dose is two pills once per day.

DOCTOR T348
Uh-huh yeah.  So each pill has 12.5 of hydrochlorothiazide and 50 of the Losartan.

PATIENT T348
I got it, gotcha.

DOCTOR T348
(Someone knocks on the door)  Come in.  Okay thank you.  Okay and then I'm gonna have you check your blood pressure at home and then the nurse can call you in a couple of weeks.

PATIENT T348
Okay.

DOCTOR T348
And just ask you what it is.  That way you don't have to come back in.

PATIENT T348
Okay.

DOCTOR T348
And if it's not controlled we might just start you on amlodipine again.

PATIENT T348
Okay.  I'll start tracking.

DOCTOR T348
Alright.  So I put your labs in @@@ and that should be good enough for the renal people.  They'll ask you for some urine.

PATIENT T348
Okay.

DOCTOR T348
I'll put everything they might want in.  Do you have any other questions?  Do you need anything else?

PATIENT T348
Uh just um, I think there were two things.  So the first thing is what's the point of contact if I run out of medicine again that I can get a hold of you?

DOCTOR T348
You can call here, the nurses or and they can usually just have the doctors like usually DOCTOR can refill it from here.

PATIENT T348
Okay alright so just call the Green clinic.

DOCTOR T348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T348
And that'll work it out.

SECOND PERSON T348
And then the thing if he decides something in the combo pill doesn't work like the other one did or something he works with, he's unhappy with.

DOCTOR T348
Uh-huh.  And I plan to see him back in two months just to like sort that out.

PATIENT T348
Okay that's fine yeah.

DOCTOR T348
Okay.  This is, once we sort it out and as long as you're stable you can just come like a regular doctor's visit once a year.

PATIENT T348
Okay sure.

DOCTOR T348
Okay.  But just to check on your meds and everything.

PATIENT T348
No that makes sense.

DOCTOR T348
Alright.  Any other questions?

PATIENT T348
No it's just uh @@@.

DOCTOR T348
The fish oil.

PATIENT T348
Oh yeah fish oil is probably a good thing to put me on.

DOCTOR T348
Yeah.

PATIENT T348
Is there um uh so I have been having like acne issues.  I was wondering if it was possible to see a dermatologist?

DOCTOR T348
Yeah you should be able to come in and see them.  Let me get  your fish oil @@@.  You remember if it was 1000?

PATIENT T348
Yeah it was 1000.

DOCTOR T348
Twice a day.

PATIENT T348
Twice a day.

DOCTOR T348
Okay and I can put in a referral for the dermatologist but um let me see if I can give you something.  Have you tried anything before?

PATIENT T348
Oh my God.

SECOND PERSON T348
He has been dealing with this.

PATIENT T348
Years.

DOCTOR T348
Years.

PATIENT T348
Yeah when I was in high school I started out on tetracycline and then that got moved up to minocycline at some point.

DOCTOR T348
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T348
Uh so it's kind of been @@@.

DOCTOR T348
Have you tried like Retin A and all that other stuff?

PATIENT T348
Yeah they did try Retin A once that was kind of nasty.

DOCTOR T348
Yeah.

PATIENT T348
Not good.

DOCTOR T348
Dried you out pretty good.  Have you tried, but can @@@ and see if that works.  Do you think it @@@ some kind of service connection for @@@.

PATIENT T348
I think I'm like at 0% for derm.

DOCTOR T348
You're at 0% for derm?

PATIENT T348
Yeah.

DOCTOR T348
I don’t think that'll work, let me just see.  Have you tried, so you've tried hydrogen peroxide, you've tried?

SECOND PERSON T348
And he's tried a lot of things but given his long history, we felt that he should see Derm regularly.

DOCTOR T348
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON T348
@@@.

DOCTOR T348
Yeah and he can be referred to them and so.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON T348
I think it's @@@ acne because it's not just regular acne.  It was really bad when you were in Iraq right?

PATIENT T348
That's true, that’s why it’s a 0% service connection.

DOCTOR T348
Uh-huh.  And you saw DOCTOR so they'll see you, so I'll put it in.  There you go and okay.

SECOND PERSON T348
12.5 @@@.

PATIENT T348
It's 12.5 x2, so that's 25 and then the 50 times two is 100.

SECOND PERSON T348
So which pill is which?

PATIENT T348
So it's 12.5 of the hydrochlorothiazide.

DOCTOR T348
Okay yeah I put it in.  Let me put it on here and they can just schedule the appointment.  Specialty clinic, Derm, Neprhology.  That's okay.

PATIENT T348
Okay well thanks so much, sure appreciate.

DOCTOR T348
No worries.

PATIENT T348

DOCTOR T348

PATIENT T348

DOCTOR T348

PATIENT T348
Well no I mean I know all the pressure on the MDs and like.

DOCTOR T348
