PATIENT?

PATIENT Z641
Yes sir.

DOCTOR Z641

Good to see you again.

All my life.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay.

PATIENT Z641
All my life.  No I was born right here in Forest Park.

DOCTOR Z641
No kidding, right down the street huh.

PATIENT Z641
Right down the street.  When I came back out of service I moved to Maywood with my wife cause I married her while I was in service and uh we looked around, we lived with my mother-in-law and father-in-law for 3 1/2 years.  We were looking for a place to buy.  So we finally found a place and then we took the two of them with em, they went with us.

DOCTOR Z641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z641
There was a couple of rooms finished off in the basement in the house we bought.  They were with me for over 20 some years.

DOCTOR Z641
Wow.  Was that here in Forest Park?

PATIENT Z641
No Melrose Park.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay.

PATIENT Z641
They were living in Maywood and we lived with them for 3 1/2 years.

DOCTOR Z641

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah.

PATIENT Z641
I used to sing a lot and uh lately if, now I'm singing in church too.

DOCTOR Z641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z641
And uh sometimes when I sing it irritates my throat.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay.

PATIENT Z641
I was just wondering if I ought to see a throat specialist.

DOCTOR Z641
Are you getting pain when you swallow?

PATIENT Z641
Sometimes without any, without any reason it kind of irritates a little bit.

DOCTOR Z641
Um, how long has this been going on?

PATIENT Z641
Oh just recently.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
So it's been going on for several days in a row or does it come and go kind of?

PATIENT Z641
Oh, well sometimes, no it's longer than a few days uh.  Occasionally I get hoarse and even when I'm talking to my daughter on the phone, she dad, what's the matter with your voice and she notices the irregularity.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay.

PATIENT Z641
Right now it's, not, it's not quite the pitch that it usually is.

DOCTOR Z641
Um has this been like for, I guess what I'm trying to ask you is this just something kind of coming over or like has it been there for a while now?

PATIENT Z641
No it comes and goes.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay, so it's not like uh.

PATIENT Z641
Not like a constant.

DOCTOR Z641
I gotcha.  Um any, so no real pain, you're able to swallow food okay for the most part?

DOCTOR Z641
Okay.  Have you had allergies?

PATIENT Z641

DOCTOR Z641
Okay and is it exactly the same on the other side too?

PATIENT Z641
Both the same.

DOCTOR Z641
Any trouble walking?

PATIENT Z641

DOCTOR Z641
That's a little bit higher than before right?

PATIENT Z641
Pardon?

DOCTOR Z641

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah.  Uh you also have protein in your urine as well and we had both of those, I know lisinopril is one and there's another medicine that's kind of diabetes management.  Um okay.  You want to have a seat up here for me?

PATIENT Z641
Oh sure.

DOCTOR Z641
Uh, @@@, got it.  Can I get you to take your shoes and socks off?

PATIENT Z641
Huh.

DOCTOR Z641
You're the most nimble 90-year-old guy I've seen.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay, alright.

PATIENT Z641
I was, I went down to uh Texas in August.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay.

PATIENT Z641
My granddaughter graduated from basic training for the Air National Guard.

DOCTOR Z641
Oh wow.

PATIENT Z641
And uh I had to fly down to Albuquerque and then we drove down to San Antonio.

DOCTOR Z641
Holy cow, that's a long drive.

PATIENT Z641
Oh year it is, 12 hours.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah, Texas is a big state you know.

PATIENT Z641
And uh.

DOCTOR Z641
Was it the summer or what?

PATIENT Z641
You noticed.

DOCTOR Z641
Isn't it hot down there in August?

PATIENT Z641
Not bad.

DOCTOR Z641
San Antonio?

PATIENT Z641
It wasn't bad.  Well I'm used to it.  I was down there for two years during the war.

DOCTOR Z641
Oh yeah?

PATIENT Z641
I was in Galveston, between.

DOCTOR Z641
Galveston is hot yeah.

PATIENT Z641
I was between Galveston and Houston at Camp Wallace for two years.

DOCTOR Z641
Did you like it down there?

PATIENT Z641
Well it was nice.  I had my wife with me for a year.

DOCTOR Z641
Deep breath in and out.  Breathe normal.

PATIENT Z641
You want the shirt off?

DOCTOR Z641
That's fine.  Almost done.  Alright.

PATIENT Z641
Well that sounds alright.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah.  Let's take a look at your throat, can you say ah?

PATIENT Z641
Ah.

DOCTOR Z641
Mmm, not too bad okay.  Did you take your blood pressure medicine today?

PATIENT Z641
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay, your blood pressure is high.

PATIENT Z641
No, oh yeah it is every time I come in.  I got the white coat syndrome.

DOCTOR Z641
Oh yeah.

PATIENT Z641
My had it too.

DOCTOR Z641
Do you check it at home?

PATIENT Z641
Yes.

DOCTOR Z641
What is it at home?

PATIENT Z641
Today I think it was 132/51 if I'm not mistaken.

DOCTOR Z641
Do you check it every day?

PATIENT Z641
Every day, every morning at 7 o'clock.

DOCTOR Z641
Wow.  Okay.  Do you mind if I check it?

PATIENT Z641
No, no, be my guest.  Do you the sleeve off?

DOCTOR Z641
No just higher, @@@.  

PATIENT Z641
Whatever you need, you just tell me that's all.  We'll get along fine.

DOCTOR Z641
(Laughs).  Just relax your arm.

PATIENT Z641
I should of brought my book along, cause I check my blood sugar every morning too.  I think this morning it was 132.  The only thing on that machine that they gave me to test your blood pressure, the pulse always shows up low.

DOCTOR Z641
Does it?

PATIENT Z641
Today it was 41.

DOCTOR Z641
Your pulse is lower.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
I know that.

PATIENT Z641
It's usually lower than average.

DOCTOR Z641
Average yeah.

PATIENT Z641
Uh.

DOCTOR Z641
Well if you want to check it, you just get a stop watch or look at a clock and you can compare the two you know.

PATIENT Z641
Well I did, they did that here for me uh.  One of the previous doctors I had was wondering whether I needed a pacemaker or not so they had, uh EKGs, a couple of those and uh then they said well we're gonna send you to the doctor, well they sent me to the head man.  I was fortunate to get the best and uh he looked at the EKGs and he checked me over like you're doing and he said what the hell did they send you in here for?

DOCTOR Z641
(Laughs)

PATIENT Z641
He says go home and enjoy your life.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah.  But.

PATIENT Z641
They took the pulse and it was low.  He took it and it was at normal.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah.  So it could have been uh yeah.  User error right?

PATIENT Z641
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay, so let's go with your feet.  I think this is probably diabetic.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
Um, you know it's not unexpected having diabetes as long as you have.

PATIENT Z641
Well, I see this @@@ advertising medicine on TV, PAD.

DOCTOR Z641
That's different.

PATIENT Z641
Is it?

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah.

PATIENT Z641
Oh, oh okay.

DOCTOR Z641
I don't think you have that.

PATIENT Z641
No I.

DOCTOR Z641
That's different.

PATIENT Z641
I was just wondering, I didn't know.

DOCTOR Z641
That's poor blood flow down to your legs and I don't think you got that.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
You may have some; you know maybe not the best blood flow.

PATIENT Z641
Right.

DOCTOR Z641
Just given that we know you have heart problems.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
You've been walking the earth for @@ @@@.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
You've expect that from that but it's not the episode you're describing.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
You're describing sounds like the very beginnings of diabetic neuropathy.

PATIENT Z641
Oh.

DOCTOR Z641
Which is a complication of diabetes.

PATIENT Z641
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay.  Other complications that we see is kidneys and the eyes.

PATIENT Z641
Uh question, I have a stationary bicycle in the basement.

DOCTOR Z641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z641
I get down there whenever I think of it, I get down there and I get on for about 15 minutes, does that help?

DOCTOR Z641
Shouldn't have much affect.

PATIENT Z641
Won't have much?

DOCTOR Z641
It's not the blood circulation.  

PATIENT Z641
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Z641
I mean it's good for your diabetes in general to be active.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
But this is after time just the sugar uh damages the nerves.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
After a period of time.

PATIENT Z641
Okay.

DOCTOR Z641
So uh, it's a chronic condition.  It's not reversible really.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
Um you just kind of try to treat it symptomatically if you can so, there's a couple ways we can go with it.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
We try medication, there's a couple medications for this, I don't think it works very well.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
And now you know whenever you add another medication there's the risks of side effects and those type of things or two we just go on without medication.  Um, the best way to treat it is just to keep good control of your blood sugar and do those types of things.

PATIENT Z641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z641
Blood sugar, blood pressure.

PATIENT Z641
I hear that.  I have trouble there because I gotta a nice neighbor, an Italian widow and she and my wife were like this.  Now that my wife's gone, she feels that she has to take care of me.

DOCTOR Z641
(Laughs).

PATIENT Z641
So I get bowls of pasta and Italian, what do they call those sticks that they make Italian.

DOCTOR Z641
The sausages or what?

PATIENT Z641
No, no, no, like cookies.

DOCTOR Z641
Oh, I know what you're talking about.

PATIENT Z641
You know what I mean.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah those are like those round ones, yeah.

PATIENT Z641
I got a, biscotti yeah.  I got a whole dish of (laughs).

DOCTOR Z641
You can't eat this stuff okay?

PATIENT Z641
I do, I take one.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah.

PATIENT Z641
One is as much as I take.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay.  Uh, the throat.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
It doesn't look very terrible to me.  I don't feel anything.  I don't think it's infected or anything like that.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
What it could be is one of two things, allergies or it could just the season you get dry air and that type of thing.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
For some reason it comes and goes.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
So um, we could one of two things, we could try to treat the allergies and see how that works um and we could give you, the way you do that is you take a pill for allergies, there's a nasal spray for allergies.  There are also nasal sprays of sterile water that just helps keep everything moist back there.

PATIENT Z641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z641
And that might help.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
More.  That's what I would suggest to you.  @@@.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah, I had uh what difference that I hear in this; oh I remember I was in the drug store.  I went in to get something for a stuffy head.

DOCTOR Z641
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z641
And uh I talked to the pharmacist and he didn't notice but there was an elderly gentleman standing to his right and uh after the pharmacist walked away the doctor told him, he says look I'm a doctor, take and use a salt solution, put it in your tent and inhale it.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah.

PATIENT Z641
He said that's as simple as you can get.

DOCTOR Z641
It said living diabetes, right.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
That's why you're doing the salt water.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
That's exactly right, you just keep them moist.

PATIENT Z641
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z641
We could try something like that.  That you can even buy over-the-counter or I could try to get you some here from the VA but then there's a nasal spray, it's a steroid spray, it helps reduce inflammation.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
And uh there's a pill that you take for allergies.  I think this may be allergic or it just may be seasonal but I think we could try to do both of them and see if that kind of makes things better and then we could kind of stop doing them for a time.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.  No that's alright.  I don't have to sing that much in church because most of the time I'm out in the vestibule cause I'm an usher now.

DOCTOR Z641
You don't want to try these things?

PATIENT Z641
Oh I'll try something sure.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay and then for the feet.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
Did you want to try the medication or not?  You know I would propose that we don't, just because they don't work real good.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
Uh and it's a pill that you take three times a day and you have to start out at low doses and you build up and even then it doesn't work very well.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
Unfortunately these are the only things that we don't normally like to treat.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
It's a complication from diabetes.

PATIENT Z641
Okay.

DOCTOR Z641
I mean if you want the medicine, it's basically just to help relieve the symptoms.  You're not having any pain in your feet, just.

PATIENT Z641
Well let's go without it for just now.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay, I kind of like that idea too.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah alright.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay.  Um let me get you set up.  We'll get your labs; I'll refill your medications um.  Why don't you go ahead and get dressed and I'll be back in a couple of minutes okay?

PATIENT Z641
Okie doke.


DOCTOR Z641
Needs some help, got it?

PATIENT Z641
I was just wondering with my instability whether I should be walking with a cane or not.

DOCTOR Z641
Uh do you think you need one?

PATIENT Z641
I'd rather not if I don't need it.

DOCTOR Z641
I'm not gonna tell you, but it's got to be your decision.  I mean you know if you need help.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
And uh.

PATIENT Z641
No I uh.

DOCTOR Z641
I can't tell you just by looking at you.

PATIENT Z641
No I can walk pretty good.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay, I'm not gonna make you get a cane if you.

PATIENT Z641
Uh I was questioned about that trip to Washington @@@.

DOCTOR Z641
Oh yeah.

PATIENT Z641
Those things?

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT Z641
The VFW.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah.

PATIENT Z641
And on the questionnaire if you can walk the length of a football field that'll be one thing but if you need a cane or if you need a wheelchair we will provide it so uh I'm kind of banking on that.

DOCTOR Z641
(Laughs)

PATIENT Z641
I hope to go there spring.

DOCTOR Z641
Well that'd be great.  Alright, give me a minute to get this stuff set-up alright.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah, fine.

DOCTOR OUT:  60:37  DOCTOR IN:  67:31

DOCTOR Z641
Alrighty.  So let's uh.  His blood pressure yeah so.  There's another one that was high too before, uh if you take it at home that's fine.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
So let's do this, I'll give you a nasal saline spray.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
You get any drops that relieve, it's cheaper than if I gave it to you.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
Or what I can give you is um the pills for allergies if you want.  I think we should try both and just and if that works then we know that we're kind of hitting the right thing.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
How's that sound?

PATIENT Z641
Yeah that sounds about right.

DOCTOR Z641
So you should probably go pick it up today in the Pharmacy uh, and hopefully it will help you out.  They have them over-the-counter too um but we can get it from here pretty cheap I think.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
It's just like Claritin or any of those that you can buy.  I'm sure you've seen those and then uh I will see you again, uh what do you think, three months okay?

PATIENT Z641
You tell me.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah, let's try three months and we could take some labs you at that time.

PATIENT Z641
Alright.

DOCTOR Z641
And you should be fasting because we want to check the cholesterol and that type of thing okay.

PATIENT Z641
I think, I think my wife was using a spray called Afrin.

DOCTOR Z641
Afrin you're not gonna use.

PATIENT Z641
No.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah, let's avoid that.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
That's for uh runny nose mostly and stuffy nose sometimes.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
And uh, I don't like it.  It can increase your blood pressure, it can speed your heart up uh.  You kind of become addicted to it so if you don't use it you could have a stuffy nose all the time.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
It's just a kind of medicine, except for a very specific situation.

PATIENT Z641
Good to know, that's enough.

DOCTOR Z641
Alright.

PATIENT Z641
I'll take your word for it.

DOCTOR Z641
Uh okay.  

PATIENT Z641
Now I should stop downstairs at the Pharmacy.

DOCTOR Z641
You got a couple stops.  First is at the nurses right here.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
You know where that is?

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
And on your way out, you go to the front desk.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
They'll make an appointment in three months.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
And then you stop at the Pharmacy and they should be getting your medicine ready right now.

PATIENT Z641
Oh, okay.

DOCTOR Z641
So I think by the time you get down there it'll be ready.

PATIENT Z641
Fine, thank you.

DOCTOR Z641
In theory no I mean, it may not be, you know.

PATIENT Z641
No they're pretty good down there.

DOCTOR Z641
Okay so then.

PATIENT Z641
When they say waiting time is a half hour, it usually is about a half hour.

DOCTOR Z641
Um so next time we see you, we'll schedule those labs.

PATIENT Z641
Alright.

DOCTOR Z641
Um we'll just do blood draws to make sure your fasting lipids, check your urine too.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z641
And after that and I hope you have a Merry Christmas.

PATIENT Z641
Thank you, same to you.  Good luck.

DOCTOR Z641
Yes thanks.  Stay warm out there huh.

PATIENT Z641
Pardon?

DOCTOR Z641
Try to stay warm out there.

PATIENT Z641
Oh I'm always warm.

DOCTOR Z641
@@@.

PATIENT Z641
I bet I've got more clothes than you could possibly wear in your lifetime.  My wife believed in having everything in the closet.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah just in case right.

PATIENT Z641
Oh hell.  Up in the attic, when I was cleaning that out, I'm still working on it incidentally.  I see some of her wigs up there yet and stuff like that and uh at one side of the attic; to the stop of the steps she had eight garment bags.  I started at this end and worked through one at a time, her clothes, my clothes.  I came to the last one.  I opened the zipper and I almost fell over.  Ten of my older suits were in there.  When I worked in the office down at Brinks, so I needed clothes but then I went downstairs in the closets, I got 11 outfits down there (laughs).

DOCTOR Z641
@@@ yeah.  It's to have back-ups to your back-ups.

PATIENT Z641
No so every morning I was at home, or every Sunday morning I wear a suit to church, different one all the time you know.  People say what did you do get another suit (laughs).

DOCTOR Z641
Now you @@@.

PATIENT Z641
Oh yeah.  

DOCTOR Z641
Alright sir, so the first stop will be the Nurses Station and uh, go right down here to this door and it's on your left side then okay.

PATIENT Z641
Yeah, thank you doctor.

DOCTOR Z641
Take care.  Have a great holiday.

PATIENT Z641
Merry Christmas and have a safe New Year.

DOCTOR Z641
Alright then I'll see you again in uh.

PATIENT Z641
In three months.

DOCTOR Z641
Yeah, it'll be early winter.

PATIENT Z641
Okie doke.
