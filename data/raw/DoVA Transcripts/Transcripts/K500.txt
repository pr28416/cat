DOCTOR K500
Okay.  The last time we did a stress test for you was in 2008 and you got really short of breath and they had to stop it.  Do you ever remember having an echo done at the VA?  An echocardiogram, it's like an ultrasound of your heart.  I don't see one in the file here.

DOCTOR K500
Did they go in through the groin and put in a stent?

PATIENT K500
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K500
Okay.  Where was that done at?

PATIENT K500
Uh yes, shortness, I was really short of breath and um I was rushed to the hospital.  No, I don't have them at all.

DOCTOR K500
How many stents did they place in your heart?

PATIENT K500

DOCTOR K500
Just one or?

PATIENT K500
I think it was one.  See this is the third time they done did something to my heart.

DOCTOR K500
Hmm.  But you had a heart surgery.

PATIENT K500
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR K500
Back in 2001.

PATIENT K500
Right.

DOCTOR K500
Okay.  But since then nothing's happened.

DOCTOR K500

PATIENT K500
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K500
So March is a bad month one for you.  

PATIENT K500
What can I say?

DOCTOR K500
So since they put the stent in, is anything gotten better or worse or is it the same?

PATIENT K500
Uh I mean, I don't know.  I don't complain.

DOCTOR K500
Okay.

PATIENT K500
Same to me.  I mean you know every now and then you feel like uh, discomfort in this area but nothing to cry about.

DOCTOR K500
Okay.  If it gets bad though, you need to talk to somebody or go to the ED okay.  Cause you do have a lot of cardiac disease that we worry about it.

PATIENT K500
Right.

DOCTOR K500
You know.  Okay, yeah definitely fax me those records okay.  I'll tell them to provide you the fax number.  Um and then when was the last time we checked your cholesterol?  Let's take a look.

PATIENT K500
I had some blood work done, what was it?

DOCTOR K500
In February.

PATIENT K500
Uh yes uh, the doctor had me do it.

DOCTOR K500
They checked everything but the cholesterol.

PATIENT K500
That wasn't nice.

DOCTOR K500
So I had checked your cholesterol, let's see that was in August when I saw you and your um LDL was a little bit high.  It was 123, it's your bad cholesterol is high.  We have you on um a statin; let me see if we changed anything since that time.

PATIENT K500
It should be down with the good diet I'm using.

DOCTOR K500
Yeah and you, you're doing really well with your MOVE Program.  Are you taking that pill every single day, that statin?

PATIENT K500
I forget it sometimes but I take it.

DOCTOR K500
You forget sometimes.  Try to take it as much as you can and take it every day before you go to bed.  Put it by your nightstand and take it every night because if you keep forgetting to take it your cholesterol can go up and then that's what can give you more heart attacks.

PATIENT K500
Okay.

DOCTOR K500
You know that one's really, really important.  That one and the Plavix are your two most important medications okay.  Alright so we'll recheck, we'll recheck your cholesterol um.  When are you coming back?  Are you going to be back here us any time soon?

PATIENT K500
Uh yes, I'm gonna be back uh.

DOCTOR K500
You're here.

PATIENT K500
The 24th.

DOCTOR K500
4th, okay.  Can I order a fasting lipid profile for then?

PATIENT K500
Sure I can do it.

DOCTOR K500
Can you not eat in the morning and get your lab drawn?

PATIENT K500
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K500
Okay.  Oh I see, they didn't collect it last time, your cholesterol because maybe you weren't fasting.  Make sure you don't eat anything for 12 hours before you have the blood draw.

PATIENT K500
I didn't eat nothing that day.

DOCTOR K500
Hmm, that's weird cause it was ordered.  I wonder why.  And then let's see, your sugars, let's take a look at that.  Your liver enzymes look good; your kidneys are working really well.  And we checked your hemoglobin A1c which is like your sugars to see how your sugars are well controlled.

PATIENT K500
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K500
And it was still good then but I'd like to check it again.  I'm gonna check it on the 24th when you get your labs done okay.

PATIENT K500
Okay.

DOCTOR K500
And do you know when we last checked your prostate?  Let's take a look at that.  Okay we'll check your prostate level too.  Still not smoking?

PATIENT K500

DOCTOR K500
Good for you.  Okay.  And how's your blood pressure been doing?

PATIENT K500

PATIENT K500
Mine was 112/66, I had that.

DOCTOR K500
That's really good.

PATIENT K500
Okay then that was this morning but yesterday was 140/78.

DOCTOR K500
That's a little high.

PATIENT K500
Well I got, you know, things going on at home.  I have my mother-in-law who has dementia.

DOCTOR K500
Oh.

PATIENT K500

DOCTOR K500

PATIENT K500

DOCTOR K500
Yeah.

PATIENT K500
This morning but I, but like I said I get in the car, sit in there, try to calm myself down.

DOCTOR K500
You bet, as long as long as you kind of have a way to.

PATIENT K500
Right.

DOCTOR K500
Take all this.

PATIENT K500
But that's what we got going on right now.

DOCTOR K500
So you've got stuff going on.

PATIENT K500
Right and it's like I'm the oldest one and they all.

DOCTOR K500
It all falls on you, yeah it's hard.

PATIENT K500
But I was wondering about that number, the numbers I gave you, you said the one this morning.

DOCTOR K500
Yeah.

PATIENT K500
Was okay?

DOCTOR K500
Yeah so your goal for your blood pressure is to stay below 140 the high number.

PATIENT K500
Okay.

DOCTOR K500
High number and then below 90 on the bottom.

PATIENT K500
Okay.

DOCTOR K500
Bottom number.  

PATIENT K500
Okay.

DOCTOR K500
If you're anywhere below the 130s, I'm really happy.  We don't want you dropping into the low like 90s or anything like that.

PATIENT K500
Okay.

DOCTOR K500
But your goal is to stay around like 120s I'm really happy with, 110s I'm really happy with for the systolic blood pressure.

PATIENT K500
Okay.

DOCTOR K500
The top number.

PATIENT K500
Okay.

DOCTOR K500
That's really what we're focused on.  That prevents your risk of stroke.

PATIENT K500
That top number is.

DOCTOR K500
The top number you want it below 140 okay.

PATIENT K500
Cause I had, you know, even though it's not that active but I do things like when you go to Walgreens and all.

DOCTOR K500
Yeah.

PATIENT K500
I always stick my arm in there.

DOCTOR K500
Yeah, yeah.  What do you usually get?

PATIENT K500
Uh on the borderline.

DOCTOR K500
Yeah.

PATIENT K500
That's when I say you know I try to calm myself down but then all this in the family and.

DOCTOR K500
Yeah.

PATIENT K500
It goes up and down.

DOCTOR K500
If you're consistently getting high blood pressures, like above the 140.

PATIENT K500

PATIENT K500
Hmm.

DOCTOR K500
Just to kind of know.  Okay and let's see.  What medications you need refilled.  You have that, you have that.  You have Plavix.  The only refill was your blood pressure medication is the only thing that was running out.  Anything else going on?

PATIENT K500
Uh, no.  Uh I want to know uh could you make appointments for me for the dentist to get some of these broken tooth out of my mouth?

DOCTOR K500
What's been happening with your teeth? 

PATIENT K500
Well believe it or not, even though when I got out I spent money on dentures; most of the ones that's broken off is the ones I got repaired in the service.

DOCTOR K500

DOCTOR K500

PATIENT K500
Oh I survive.

DOCTOR K500

PATIENT K500
I know how to work it around.  Yeah I can go get me a plate and I know the VA don't take care of that, that's alright.  They do enough for me.

DOCTOR K500
We'll see.  They are very picky on who they will actually see in Dental.

PATIENT K500
Right, I know.

DOCTOR K500
I'll put the order in and let's see what we can do.

PATIENT K500
Okay.  That's all we can do.

DOCTOR K500

PATIENT K500
What's that?

DOCTOR K500
You've heard of that?  So did you have chicken pox as a kid?

PATIENT K500
Yes.

DOCTOR K500
Okay.  If you had chicken pox as a kid that virus you know stays in your system and when you get older, like above the age of 60, your immune system it starts to kind of go down.

PATIENT K500
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K500
And then um it can flare-up and it causes like a very painful rash.  It can cause like neuropathy and stuff.  Usually we just vaccinate so it doesn't kind of kick back in in your later years.

PATIENT K500
Don't matter, if I need to get it tell me.

DOCTOR K500
Alright let's do it.  Okay.  Have you ever had a handicapped sticker before?

PATIENT K500

DOCTOR K500
Short of breath.

PATIENT K500

PATIENT K500
Well, with me favoring it, both legs hurt.  This leg, the right leg is where the problem's at.

DOCTOR K500
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K500

PATIENT K500
Okay.

DOCTOR K500
Um but this part you fill out, it's just like your license plate number and your social security, all this stuff.

PATIENT K500

DOCTOR K500
Yeah, yeah.  And were you a smoker in the past?

PATIENT K500

DOCTOR K500
Okay.  Next year we'll have to do a ultrasound of your abdomen.  When's your birthday, in May?

PATIENT K500
May 22nd.

DOCTOR K500
Maybe we can order it um, if you don't mind we'll just order it now and it's just a screen to make sure you don't have an aneurysm in your aorta.  People that have smoked in the past are at higher risk for an aneurysm and they can rupture and you can bleed internally.

PATIENT K500
No problem.

DOCTOR K500
Okay.  I'm going to go ahead and order it.  @@@.

PATIENT K500

(DOCTOR OUT:  66:40  DOCTOR IN:  72:20)

DOCTOR K500
Alright sir, you're all set.  So we'll do the labs when you come back for the MOVE Program.  I'm also going to put in um uh a consult cause you know the last time we checked your sugars they were like creeping up and they were almost at the level of diabetes and we don't want that to happen.  So I'm just gonna send you to our nutritionist that'll give you just some pre-diabetic stuff to avoid, so we don't ever get to that point.

PATIENT K500
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K500
Okay.  And that's it and then I'll have you follow up with me.  We could do another six months if you prefer we could do I don't know, what do you like, how often do you like to come in?

PATIENT K500
Well it could be every three, four months, I don't care.

DOCTOR K500
Okay we'll do that.  We could do four months.  And really try to take your lipid medication, the simvastatin.

PATIENT K500
Okay.

DOCTOR K500
And even if you can't remember it at night take it in the morning, you could take it every morning if it doesn't work at night.

PATIENT K500
That'd probably be the best time.

DOCTOR K500
Then do that, that's fine.  We really want to make sure you get it okay.  Okay.

PATIENT K500
Okay what about that other form I gave you?

DOCTOR K500
Oh yeah, you know what let me just ask her, I totally forgot, one second.

DOCTOR K500
Alright sir, all done.  I have the form filled out for you here.

PATIENT K500
