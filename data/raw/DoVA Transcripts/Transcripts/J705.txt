PATIENT J705

PATIENT J705
Fine.  Except for one thing that I got to itemize to start on Hospice.

DOCTOR J705
Say that again?

PATIENT J705
Hospice, I might not be pronouncing it right she's going to die.

DOCTOR J705
Oh Hospice.

PATIENT J705
Hospice okay I got it wrong.  Uh she's @@@.

DOCTOR J705
Oh.

PATIENT J705
And she's @@@ year. so what's going on.  I've been over the last few days; I'll probably more than likely go over there after I leave here.

DOCTOR J705
Sure.  

PATIENT J705
So that's what’s going on.  Oh I know I need to lose more weight cause see I've got prostate cancer.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
So for it's surgery I got to have.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.  They said they want, so you're opting to take it all out right?

PATIENT J705
Yeah.  I’m not going to play with @@@.

DOCTOR J705
I can tell you I think that's a good choice.

PATIENT J705
See the only reason I put it off is because, see I thought I was gonna get a chance to work at the census a while but.

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J705
I only got four days of training and then they canned me. Let's just say uh I accept a little responsibility but we just had one loud mouth that just would not be quiet and she can't put me with him.  They let's just say they was slightly bias on that.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
So okay, okay, so I didn’t get it because I was scared to come and have the surgery but when that opportunity came up, uh they it had not spreaded.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah, right.

PATIENT J705
But um, as a matter of fact after I leave from seeing you I'm going by the girlfriend and accept the appointment.

DOCTOR J705
Good, good, perfect, perfect.

PATIENT J705
But I don't know what they said in order to get my medication again.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah so let's talk about your medicines.

PATIENT J705
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR J705
What medicine.

PATIENT J705
Oh as a matter of fact, oh I'm sorry, not to cut you off.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
Okay um I receive two things.  Now in order, what happened was I applied for the little hundred dollar stipend that they give.  I was only getting food stamps but I applied for SSI back in March of last year.

DOCTOR J705
Okay.

PATIENT J705
Okay they told me while I applied for SSI that I can go apply for the little hundred dollar spiker and the medical card.  I said I don't need the medical card I go to the VA but they said you got to apply for both.  So while I'm applying for SSI, @@@ hundred dollar stipend and I applied for that.  They denied me, I applied in May of last year and they denied me in about October or November and I appealed, and they said that I need to have this filled out.  I think this was.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah let’s take a look at it.

PATIENT J705
And when I talked to the Legal Aid uh she said that she need for you to make sure that you put down that I'm taking the three blood pressure medicines, that I'm taking the medicine for diabetes, I don’t know the cholesterol one.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
And albuterol, uh even though I only occasionally have it mess up on me for asthma.

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J705
I guess that's about everything I can think of.

DOCTOR J705
Okay.  Alright so um we'll fill this out, okay.

PATIENT J705
Okay no problem.

DOCTOR J705
It's just we'll talk about your other stuff first.

PATIENT J705
Uh-huh yes ma'am.

DOCTOR J705
So tell me what blood pressure medicines are you taking right now?

PATIENT J705
Lisinopril.

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh and do you remember the dose on that one?

PATIENT J705
No ma'am.

DOCTOR J705
Does 40 sound right to you?

PATIENT J705
It's @@@.

DOCTOR J705
Let's see what they've got you on.

PATIENT J705
Right, it might be in the neighborhood.

DOCTOR J705
@@@.

PATIENT J705
I'll have to be honest I just take it, I don't pay no attention.

DOCTOR J705
That's okay.

PATIENT J705
Atenolol.

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J705
I take amlodipine.

DOCTOR J705
Okay amlodipine.

PATIENT J705
Amlodipine okay.

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J705
Yes that's the three medications.

DOCTOR J705
And then the atenolol.

PATIENT J705
And I take the cholesterol pill.

DOCTOR J705
Yes.

PATIENT J705
Sim uh.

DOCTOR J705
Simvastatin?

PATIENT J705
Yeah I take that and I take a.

DOCTOR J705
You take half of it right?

PATIENT J705
Right, I like once in a while I'll take a full one but most of the time I split it and that's when I get lazy when I take a full.

DOCTOR J705
Uh and then um now for your diabetes you're taking the metformin.

PATIENT J705
Metformin.

DOCTOR J705
Metformin so it's 1000 mg twice a day right?

PATIENT J705
Right.

DOCTOR J705
Okay.

PATIENT J705
Sometimes I do, not do what I'm supposed to and take only one but that's not @@@.  What's the best time to take the metformin?

DOCTOR J705
So once in the morning and then once in the evening.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Whatever you want to do it.

PATIENT J705
So I'll make a point of that.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.  Just take it before you know like once before breakfast and once before dinner.

PATIENT J705
Alright.

DOCTOR J705
That's the best way and then um you still taking the baby aspirin?

PATIENT J705
Yes for the blood thinner?

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Good.  So there is a couple things we ought to work on and um a lot of it is just to update some stuff you know.  Like we don't have a recent cholesterol on you so we should get it.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Okay and we don't have a recent, do you remember what a A1c is, the hemoglobin A1c?

PATIENT J705
No, the only people who have been taking blood.

DOCTOR J705
For the Urology huh?

PATIENT J705
Right.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.  So the hemoglobin A1c, what it is is it's a measure of um what your average blood sugar is over a three month period so it's a little bit better than just checking the blood with the Accu-Cheks okay.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Um the lab shows, anybody with diabetes their goal is less than 7.  The last time we checked it on you was back in June of last year and it was 6.6.  I want to make sure that you're still doing okay with that okay.  

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
So we can check another one okay.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
In your blood.

PATIENT J705
No problem.

DOCTOR J705
And then the other thing I want to talk to you about is that do you feel like you're having any blurry vision or?

PATIENT J705
Well I need to wear glasses.  I'm not going to sit there and lie to you.

DOCTOR J705
Okay.

PATIENT J705
It's just that uh I @@@ not the best, I look like Dr. Clyde, that's not an excuse so when I get the ones they say get it.

DOCTOR J705
That's fine.  I want you to see the eye doctor anyway because the diabetes can affect your eyes you know and we got to make sure that it hasn't affected your okay.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
So um we'll put you in to see the eye doctor, the same thing is diabetes affects your feet as well so we'll get you in.

PATIENT J705
My feet?

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J705
In what way?

DOCTOR J705
So uh what it's called, it's called peripheral neuropathy.  It could be tingling in your feet.  It could be where you're running into things and you're bumping into things and.

PATIENT J705
No.

DOCTOR J705
I'm sure @@@ on it but I didn't want um.

PATIENT J705
Well not when I might get up in the morning and I'm halfway groggy I'm like.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
@@@.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
But I don't know.

DOCTOR J705
That's good um and then, let's see one other thing.  So we'll get you in to see all those fun folks.

PATIENT J705
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J705
It's just one of those things where you know you kind of have to keep up with it.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
And then the other thing is you know why don't, your potassium every once in a while, there's been a little bit on the lower side.

PATIENT J705
What do I need to do, banana?

DOCTOR J705
Bananas help.

PATIENT J705
I just can't eat bananas.  I.

DOCTOR J705
You don't like them?

PATIENT J705
No put it this way, they don't like me.

DOCTOR J705
Don't like you okay.

PATIENT J705
Yeah cause I remember when I was younger, what happened was when I was back in my late teens, yeah cause I wasn't in my 20s yet, uh I worked at a chain of restaurants called Chicken Unlimited.

DOCTOR J705
Okay.

PATIENT J705
And I would eat @@@ like they going out of style.

DOCTOR J705
Okay.

PATIENT J705
It got to the point where my stomach said I don't think so.  So I had to I mean and then if I wanted a lemon meringue pie, once I was eating watermelon and a stack of shrimp, uh the bananas.

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh.  Okay, okay.  Well there's pills we can give you, we can give you potassium pills.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Okay.  Now my other question to you is um you were, have you ever had a colonoscopy?  Do you know what that is?

PATIENT J705
Refresh my memory.

DOCTOR J705
So it's where we basically, we're screening for colon cancer.

PATIENT J705
Wasn't that with a card?

DOCTOR J705
So that's for your stools to check for blood.

PATIENT J705
Okay, no okay, okay.

DOCTOR J705
This one is where we give you some medicine, makes you a little sleepy and then what we do is we take a camera and we take a look up your bottom and we take a look all the way through um and if we see anything we can go ahead and just right there and then we can take off the polyp.

PATIENT J705
I'm not gonna say no but I'm not so sure cause I never.

DOCTOR J705
You have all your stuff done here right?

PATIENT J705
Yes I don't go no where else.

DOCTOR J705
Okay and I don't see a referral for that so.

PATIENT J705
And it hasn't been any time recent.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah so um we recommend it to everybody over the age of 50.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Now is that something you're okay with?

PATIENT J705
I don't know.

DOCTOR J705
Okay.

PATIENT J705
You say that you're gonna have me on my side or on my stomach you gonna look up a rectum.

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J705
And then worse come to worse what?

DOCTOR J705
So there's a couple things.  Usually for most people you look up there and you don't find anything.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
And you just repeat it in ten years.  You're good for ten years.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Some people they can have what are called polyps or little growths.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
And uh some of those polyps can turn into cancer.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
It's a very slow growing cancer so the reason we do it is that we take a look, we can take out the polyp and we can just look under the microscope.  If its cancer then you know we have lots of options, if it's not then we repeat it in five or ten years.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
I'll try it.

DOCTOR J705
So we'll do that.  You know, it's nothing that urgently needs to be done over the next few months you know.

PATIENT J705
Well should I have it done before or after my prostate cancer surgery?

DOCTOR J705
Uh that's up to you.  That's up to you.

PATIENT J705
Oh okay.  Alright, probably then I'll have it, let's see I should get the blood thinner thing uh well hmm.

DOCTOR J705
But if you want to wait till after that's fine too.

PATIENT J705
Okay so that's one of the other things you let me think about it.

DOCTOR J705
Okay why don't you think about it and then you can tell me next time okay.

PATIENT J705
Okay, that's good enough.

DOCTOR J705
Um and then yeah we should maybe check your cholesterol and what not.  Alright so let me take a listen to you and see how you sound.  Are you having any fevers, any chills, any pain?

PATIENT J705
No ma'am.

DOCTOR J705
Chest, back, breathing troubles?

PATIENT J705
No.

DOCTOR J705
Nothing like that.

PATIENT J705
Uh the only time my asthma acts up is when I get some change of weather here.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
It's very similar, exactly @@@.

DOCTOR J705
Good.  Deep breath.  Good now just breathe normal okay.  Now um has anybody told you about our MOVE Program here?

PATIENT J705
@@@ refresh @@@.

DOCTOR J705
No, so it's basically um a program that helps you with diet and exercises and losing weight.  Um now.  A couple of the patients that I've had have had excellent success with it.  Like one guy lost like 40 pounds, another one lost almost 100 pounds.

PATIENT J705
How long did it take him to lose?

DOCTOR J705
So, uh I think I'd say they lost the majority of their weight within the first like six months or so.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah alright so um let me go find.

PATIENT J705
Alright.

DOCTOR J705
I could go show you, actually.

PATIENT J705
Is it a nutritionist?

DOCTOR J705
Um well it's a nutritionist who like will give you like the first appointment and then they'll set you up for the class.  I think it's worth checking out.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Okay, alright.  We can do that, alright.  Let me talk with my boss and see if she’s got anything to add and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT J705
No problem.

DOCTOR J705
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  18:19  DOCTOR IN:  28:35)

PATIENT J705
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Hi there.  I think we've slightly, we met this year.

PATIENT J705
Yes ma'am.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
When I was working for DOCTOR.  Nice to formerly meet you, I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT J705
Yes ma'am.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
So DOCTOR was telling me that you were diagnosed with prostate cancer recently.

PATIENT J705
Uh last year.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Last year okay.

PATIENT J705
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
And they're just wanting to watch, they don't want to be aggressive about it at this point or?

PATIENT J705
Uh I think they caught it early.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Okay.

PATIENT J705
Uh they wanted me to go on, like I said I put off.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Having your prostate removed.

PATIENT J705
I put off the surgery earlier this year.  In fact @@@ I put it off. It’s the second time I’ve put it off.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
You know, I was just telling DOCTOR we were talking and you're such a young person that you really should get that.  If I were you or if you were my relative I would say you should have the surgery.

PATIENT J705
I'm gonna have the surgery.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
As a matter of fact I'm going to the urologist after I get through here.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Okay.  So you have an appointment already?

PATIENT J705
Not with them yet, I had it but I didn't go through with it.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Okay.

PATIENT J705
I was scheduled for the surgery.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Okay.  Well I would say you know now.

PATIENT J705
I'm going back to have it done.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Okay good because um you've got a lot of living to do.

PATIENT J705
I hope so.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Usually the watching is fine, especially with older gentlemen because it's a slow growing cancer but you're a young person so you know it's better to be more aggressive early when you catch it because we don't want, you've got a lot of time left on this earth so uh I think yeah and you were just gonna talk to him about the potassium thing.

FIRST DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Um so no for colonoscopy right?

FIRST DOCTOR J705
Uh next time, next time sorry.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Well it looks like you're in good hands.

PATIENT J705
Thank you ma'am.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
Just wanted to make sure to introduce myself, take care.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR J705
It's nice to see you.

PATIENT J705
Alright you too.

FIRST DOCTOR J705
Alrighty.  First things first um let's talk about your diabetes okay.  So what we're gonna do with the diabetes, we're not gonna change anything uh as far as your medicines.  But we are gonna check to see where you're at right now with it okay.  

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
So that includes the blood tests that we're checking of the A1c.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Uh and that's just a blood test so we'll do that and then we'll set you up to see our eye doctors.

PATIENT J705
Okay and then what's that other one that the nutritionist?

DOCTOR J705
Yeah I'll get you there just one second.

PATIENT J705
@@@.  Is it possible to do all this within this month huh?

DOCTOR J705
I think that's more on your schedule than anything else.

PATIENT J705
I don't know.  Only reason I say that I get reimbursed for my bus fare now they said you have to have, quote-unquote within the calendar month.

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J705
So if I'm gonna do it I'd rather do it when I get reimbursed for it cause if I spread to like May.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
They probably say well you got x amount for April but you have four for May, I mean the four for April.

DOCTOR J705
Well you know it might not be, but I think you might be able to get it; there are so many clinics over here okay, so we'll do that for your diabetes.  We'll check your blood tests.  We'll go to the eye doctor; we'll go to the foot doctor.  

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Next is your potassium.  It is a little low right, just like we talked about and since bananas do not agree with you.

PATIENT J705
Naw.

DOCTOR J705
What I'd like to do is start you on just some potassium pills okay.

PATIENT J705
Good enough.

DOCTOR J705
Um so what it is it's called potassium chloride and it's a tablet and we're gonna start you off with a small baby a dose of just 20 that you take once a day.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Okay.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
And you take it daily and then next time you see me we'll give you um about three months’ worth okay and then when you see me uh we'll check your potassium.

PATIENT J705
You gonna be here for a while?

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
Good enough, so like I say check on when I want to see you again.

DOCTOR J705
I'll be here for a while okay.  Um do you want to pick these up at the window?

PATIENT J705
Yes ma'am I'll pick them up and then I think that the last blood pressure one.

DOCTOR J705
Yeah.

PATIENT J705
I am down to zippo.

DOCTOR J705
Which one?

PATIENT J705
Amlodipine.

DOCTOR J705
Amlodipine?  How long have you been out of it?

PATIENT J705
No I'm, well when I came the last time to the Pharmacy and they gave me, since I got a doctor's approval.

DOCTOR J705
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J705
I got 30 days worth if I remember correctly so that has ran out as of today.

DOCTOR J705
What now, oh you ran out today?

PATIENT J705
Yeah as far as the 30 today, in fact I had 30 days till I got to get to the doctors.

DOCTOR J705
Okay so you didn't actually miss a dose of it?

PATIENT J705
No.

DOCTOR J705
Okay, okay.  So here's the thing.  We've got to go up on something.

PATIENT J705
Okay.

DOCTOR J705
Because your blood pressure's high.  So how much of the Atenolol are you on?

PATIENT J705
Uh oh, see that's the bad thing.

DOCTOR J705
Are you on 75 or are you on 100, are you on 50?

PATIENT J705
Doc I'd be lying if I said I know the number the only thing I know is that I take them every day.

DOCTOR J705

PATIENT J705
One pill a day for atenolol, one pill a day for.

DOCTOR J705

PATIENT J705
Uh lisinopril and one pill a day for amlodipine.

DOCTOR J705

DOCTOR J705
With the nurse yeah, did you uh I know they wanted to increase it but did you actually do the increase though?

PATIENT J705
