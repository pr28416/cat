We went down there one time, we were going to Florida of course and we're coming back and it was the final four in basketball and there was, that was on and something else was on and it was raining and the traffic was really horrible and I decided that we never went down 65 again, we always go back through Alabama and all that stuff.

PATIENT V771
From you I guess.

DOCTOR V771
Well I don't see it. (keeps looking in record) @@@ expired.  Do you, did you want to pick this stuff up?

PATIENT V771

DOCTOR V771
Okay.  So it'll get there before you have to go.

PATIENT V771
Oh gosh yes.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.

PATIENT V771
Cause usually I get it, you know when I call it in, it's you know 5-10 days or less sometimes.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
And uh, we're not gonna be going for another week and a half so I'm okay.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.  Um, I'm trying to figure out uh, I'm gonna have to ask how we can give you.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.  Well don't get yourself in trouble doctor, you know hey.

DOCTOR V771
No, no, I'm sure there's a way to do it, I just don't know how, how to get it done.

PATIENT V771
Yeah that's all my doctor.

DOCTOR V771
@@@.

PATIENT V771
Huh?

DOCTOR V771
Tell your wife @@@.

PATIENT V771
Oh, I even got one for her.  Yeah, she said in case the paramedics come and get me.  They won't know to look in my purse, I say yes dear.

DOCTOR V771
Um, so your blood pressure looks good.  Are you checking it at home?

PATIENT V771
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR V771
And what's it normally?

PATIENT V771
It's usually in the 130s over 70s.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.  

PATIENT V771
And then I prick my finger periodically to check diabetes and I'm always under 140.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.  When are you checking?

PATIENT V771
I'm checking uh, like, well not today but I have my little list, I should have brought that list for you.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
But like today I would check a.m., you know before breakfast and then two hours afterwards.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
And maybe, today is what Wednesday, Friday I'll check lunch, before lunch and after lunch and Sunday, oh no Sunday.

DOCTOR V771
@@@.

PATIENT V771
No Sunday, Sunday there's a cocktail or two at least on Sunday.

DOCTOR V771
Um so when you do the very early morning ones, what's your numbers?

PATIENT V771
Sometimes it scares the heck out of me doctor.  It's, one time it was like 170-180, something like that.  Gosh I wish I'd brought it with me and I told my wife about it and she says wow, so I rechecked it a couple mornings after that and everything went down.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
And the only thing we can attribute it to is either we had a snack that night or maybe an ice cream or something like that.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
And uh, I'm like a closet drinker, but Fridays I like to have a cocktail Friday evening cause I've done that from the day I started working and then Sunday before dinner and that's about all I drink now days.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
Compared to when I was in my youth.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
But uh, that was the only time it was high.

DOCTOR V771
But that was just one time?

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.  Yeah cause the next morning you know she said let's check it again and then I was down to 127 or something like that.

DOCTOR V771
Okay, alright um, so the early morning ones, do you know what our goal was?

PATIENT V771
All I can do is when I was in for my last uh, uh angiogram my DOCTOR, my regular doctor.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
She uh, she's a diabetic nut and uh she had people from the Diabetes Office come over.

DOCTOR V771
Come by.

PATIENT V771
Come over and talk to me and what they wanted to maintain.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.

PATIENT V771
And they said I was borderline and if I watch what I eat and I do, I work out three times a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

DOCTOR V771
Great.

PATIENT V771
And uh they said you know I won't have to go on the medicine so and that's what I try and keep that 140 stuff, though under 140s.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.  But yeah, so the morning ones anywhere between like 90 and 120.

PATIENT V771
Something like that, yeah and it'll vary in there I mean.

DOCTOR V771
Okay and then the after meal ones anything less than like 150.

PATIENT V771
Oh gosh yeah, they're all down that, it's just and I don't know why, maybe you could tell me doctor.  Why is it, you know you're just laying around, you're sleeping at night and stuff and you're not eating candy bars or anything, why would it go up, I don't know.

DOCTOR V771
Well, so everybody whose normal has your pancreas makes a certain amount of insulin.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
All day and that's the amount that you have whether you're eating, whether you're sleeping, anytime.  So normal people have this basal rate.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
I mean it's a constant rate.  Up here, people with diabetes are a little bit lower so you're not; you're technically not being covered for your normal sugars during the night.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
With diabetes.

PATIENT V771
Cause my body is resting yeah.

DOCTOR V771
Right because you don't have.

PATIENT V771
I'm not active or something.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah and you don't have your pancreas making that insulin.  

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
So that's kind of what the medications are for either to help you make more of your own.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
Or to help you be more sensitive to the amount that you are making by yourself.

PATIENT V771
I think what you're saying then is I'm a good boy and I'm okay.  (Laughter)

DOCTOR V771
Yeah I think you're doing great.  Um, we haven't checked your A1c in a while.

PATIENT V771
What's that?

DOCTOR V771
Your, that tells me how well you're doing with your diabetes. Um, I can show it to you here so.

PATIENT V771
When I was here last time uh, DOCTOR she had me you know when I left her.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
She had me go downstairs and they drew some blood out of me.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah.

PATIENT V771
If that's what you're talking about.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah so that was back in March and its good, anything below 7 or below.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
Is good um and you've been right at 7, a little less previously, um for the diabetes.  So I think um.  Have you eaten anything today?

PATIENT V771
Yeah I had breakfast.

DOCTOR V771
You have eaten.  

PATIENT V771
I had you know a small bowl of oatmeal.

DOCTOR V771
Cause I think we need to check your.

PATIENT V771
She wasn't too concerned about that.  Cause I, she asked me when the last time I saw her before she moved on.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
And uh I said well I had breakfast this morning and she said I don't think it'll hurt anything.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah, if we were checking your cholesterol it would be an issue but today we don't need to check the cholesterol.  

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
She checked that last time.  Um, so we can get the test done today.

PATIENT V771
You mean stop on the way out and draw a gallon of blood.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
Or something.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah just a gallon.

PATIENT V771
(Laughter)

DOCTOR V771
Um, so that way I can see whether or not we need to go up on your medications.

PATIENT V771
Sure.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.  

PATIENT V771
But @@@.  Let me be up frank with you, now I have a cardiologist DOCTOR.

DOCTOR V771
Right.

PATIENT V771
And I, if he tells me to jump ten times I'm gonna do it.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
Cause he's been keeping me going.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah.

PATIENT V771
Cause the history of my family; I'm the first male to get past 57.

DOCTOR V771
Wow.

PATIENT V771
So whatever he's doing to me.

DOCTOR V771
Is good.

PATIENT V771
Look I want to stay with him.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah.  Um, yeah and any changes that he makes, just let me know.

PATIENT V771
That's what I've done with DOCTOR too, any time he would change something and stuff like that; I would fax a copy to her, attention to.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah.

PATIENT V771
Yeah.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah just send along the same thing.

PATIENT V771
Now do you have the same fax number as DOCTOR?  Okay so everything is the same.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT V771
I got it written at home then yeah.

DOCTOR V771
Yep, I'll @@@.  So you have your eye exam.

PATIENT V771
Yes.

DOCTOR V771
That was back in February.

PATIENT V771
Yeah she wanted to make sure to look back and I faxed her the report on that too.

DOCTOR V771
Good.  So you get that done outside of the VA?

PATIENT V771
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.  So same thing though whenever you have it again in February of this coming year.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
Just fax the report.

PATIENT V771
Or if I come to see you, I'll bring it in here yeah.

DOCTOR V771
That would be good, either way.  Um, your cholesterol looks great; your blood pressure looks great.  Uh the only thing I wanted to check was your kidney function today um.  People with diabetes sometimes um, in their urine have a little bit of protein.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
And that kind of tells us how your kidneys are doing as far as the diabetes.  Um, it hasn't been checked in a while, in a couple years.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
So just to screen you and make sure you're okay.

PATIENT V771
Sure, I don't care, great.  No I did a urine test the last time I was here.

DOCTOR V771
@@@ This particular test.

PATIENT V771
Cause are we talking about peeing in the cup?

DOCTOR V771
Yeah that may have been um.

PATIENT V771
Cause they drew blood and they gave me a little paper cup to pee in.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah, well the only one I see is from 07.

PATIENT V771
Maybe that stuff was lost huh, who knows.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah.

PATIENT V771
Maybe @@@ doctor.

DOCTOR V771
I hope not.  Um, yeah I think, I mean it's a painless test.

PATIENT V771
Oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR V771
So um.  We can do that today and check the A1c and I think as far as everything else goes, we can keep doing what we're doing.

PATIENT V771
Great.  Love to hear that, doctor.

DOCTOR V771
Alright.  And you've had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT V771
I had one about a year ago, two years ago.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.  Let's see when that was.

PATIENT V771
Hey did you increase my lisinopril or refill it so I can get more of that?  Cause they said when I called uh, they said that it's been.

DOCTOR V771
That it was expired.

PATIENT V771
Expired, big word I couldn't think of that.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah.  Um.

PATIENT V771
Do you want this blood work from here?  This is from.

DOCTOR V771
Oh yeah.  Where is this from?

PATIENT V771
That's from Afinity; in fact it's my wife's doctor.  Nice lady.

DOCTOR V771
And this was.

PATIENT V771
This was a while back.

DOCTOR V771
Oh yeah okay.

PATIENT V771
And that was because I had this before and then.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
DOCTOR cancelled something and then uh.

DOCTOR V771
@@@.

PATIENT V771
Then DOCTOR or something like that.

DOCTOR V771
DOCTOR.

PATIENT V771
DOCTOR, he wanted me to come in and then he cancelled on me and then you got stuck with me (laughter).

DOCTOR V771
No I'm not stuck.  Um, so this um, the hemoglobin A1c what we were talking about.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
Is 7.4 here, so that's a little, that's worse than the one that we drew.

PATIENT V771
Oh, okay.

DOCTOR V771
Back in March, but I think at that point the metformin was increased to 500 twice a day.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V771
Which is what you're taking now.

PATIENT V771
Yeah.

DOCTOR V771
So now today, this will be even more meaningful, that way I can see how much better you are.

PATIENT V771
Sure.

DOCTOR V771
From that.

PATIENT V771
I'm here hon.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.

PATIENT V771
I'm easy; I'll do whatever you tell me.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah.

PATIENT V771
You doctors are keeping me going.

DOCTOR V771
(Laughter).  Okay.

PATIENT V771
Now the colonoscopy, I will have that done over at uh the gastrologist's in Arlington Heights.

DOCTOR V771
Okay and you won't need another one for ten years.

PATIENT V771
No, they found a polyp.  They sent me a letter, a card and they wanted it done next year cause then that would be two years or three years or something.

DOCTOR V771
Oh so they want you to have another one?

PATIENT V771
I don't want to do it but.

DOCTOR V771
Okay so this says benign polyps.

PATIENT V771
Yes.

DOCTOR V771
But I guess not.

PATIENT V771
I really don't want to, that's, of course that's something.

DOCTOR V771
You don't happen to have the report do you?

PATIENT V771
Uh you should have a copy of it, not you but I mean your computer should.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.  I'll have to check and see, I don't see it.

PATIENT V771
If not I can go back to Gastrology and get it and then.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah, just probably fax me.

PATIENT V771
I'd better write that, you're not going to keep this paper here then?

DOCTOR V771
Uh, if it's mine for the keeping I'll keep it.

PATIENT V771
Oh yeah, you keep that.  Can I borrow one of your pens?

DOCTOR V771
Sure.

PATIENT V771
Cause then I can write my love notes to myself.

PATIENT V771

PATIENT V771
No I get a pain uh, in my left calf down here.  This is where even I had the bypass; this is where he took the vein out.

DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V771
But this one is still here, but this is my worst foot.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.  Have you ever had um any studies done about your arteries down in your legs?

DOCTOR V771
Okay, is that any different than normal?

PATIENT V771
It's normal yeah.

DOCTOR V771
Okay.

PATIENT V771
I used to be able to walk the tracks, walk the track at the Rex Plex but uh now maybe I'll do one lap and then go on the machines and I work my upper body more, more so than.

DOCTOR V771
Is this because of shortness of breath?

PATIENT V771
Right.  I have an exercycle, I got an Aerodyne at home and I have a treadmill but I'm more comfortable on the Aerodyne cause my feet don't hurt on that.

DOCTOR V771

PATIENT V771
I'll have a half of sandwich and I'm full.  Like I just ate a turkey dinner or something like that.  I'm kind of full.

DOCTOR V771
Yeah.  Sometimes that can go with diabetes; it gives you a full feeling.

PATIENT V771
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR V771
It has to do with how your stomach moves because of diabetes.

Well, I'm going down to my son in Dallas and his family, spend Christmas down with them and then we're gonna go to St. Pete's.  

SECOND DOCTOR V771
Are you gonna go to that new Cowboys dome?

PATIENT V771
No he lives up in McKinney, Texas, north of there.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
So he's kind of in the open area?

PATIENT V771
I don't know.  You know usually when I get down there, I park my car and then they take us all over the place.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
Very nice.  Then you're gonna go to St. Pete's?

PATIENT V771
Yeah then we're gonna go to St. Pete's Beach and then um, I guess @@@.  A friend of ours has a condo there and he works for a living so he can't go down so he's giving it to me almost for free.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
Okay.  

PATIENT V771
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
Sounds like fun.

PATIENT V771
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
And then you're gonna take your medications as prescribed I take it?

PATIENT V771
I'd like to.  

SECOND DOCTOR V771
Yeah.

PATIENT V771
That's why I was talking to the doctor.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
So, I think we'll change most of the medications to 90 days supply.  It's just a pain in the butt to get them every 30 days anyway.

PATIENT V771
It is.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
Um the Plavix or clopidogrel is really expensive.

PATIENT V771
Yeah that's what I was telling to the doctor and.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
And uh the VA only gives us a 30 day allotment, but you're going somewhere so stop by the Pharmacy today and say hey you know my doctor changed my other prescriptions to 90 days, can I have a three months supply of this medication because I'm leaving town.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
Then they should say okay.

PATIENT V771
Yeah cause I'm covered for December, the month of December.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
No but I'm just saying do that, go to Pharmacy today.  You might have to wait like an hour to find the pharmacist but you're leaving town.

PATIENT V771
Well I'm not leaving yet, so they could mail it if they can.

FIRST DOCTOR V771
I think you still need to talk to them.

PATIENT V771
I still got to talk to them.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
That's too secretarial for somebody, what she does for a living.

PATIENT V771
Uh-huh, I just hate to go down there.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
You gotta do it.

PATIENT V771
It's sad to go down there.  The last time I was down in the Pharmacy I saw these young men beat up and stuff like that, you know arms missing and legs and stuff and it really got to me.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
Uh-huh.  But, @@@.

PATIENT V771
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
@@@.

PATIENT V771
Yeah true yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR V771
You know, it's better here then you go to some Community Hospital, @@@.

PATIENT V771

SECOND DOCTOR V771

PATIENT V771
