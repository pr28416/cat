DOCTOR P805
You missed your eye appointment.

PATIENT P805
Yes @@@.

DOCTOR P805
We'll get you an Ophtho for you.  Alright so you had recent labs.  In January when you got labs most recently.

PATIENT P805
@@@.  What about the uh Podiatry appointment?

DOCTOR P805
Now I'm going to put it in but you haven't proven too successful at this point.

PATIENT P805
I know, you know.  I was thinking about do they have a clinic on Halsted?

DOCTOR P805
Well I don't know why they're not getting a hold of you.  Do you have any ideas?

PATIENT P805
No because uh, usually it's either on my voice mail or my son is there, one of the two and they know to give me a call.  But I have a cell phone.

DOCTOR P805
Did you give them that number?

PATIENT P805
No I didn't.

DOCTOR P805
Well I highly recommend it.  When you go to check out in the front you need to give them that number.

PATIENT P805
Okay.

DOCTOR P805
Are you having the chest pain still?

PATIENT P805
Yeah I haven't had any more since.  I got this again and @@@ to get an appointment.

DOCTOR P805
Okay.  You got to do me a favor my friend though.

PATIENT P805
What's that?

DOCTOR P805
You got to start showing up for your stuff.  You see me every time but I can't ever help you because you don't go for other stuff okay.

PATIENT P805
Now, let me @@@

DOCTOR P805
Yeah I'll move it, all of your stuff will be assigned to @@@ also.

PATIENT P805
Okay.  But what happened was, I do recall missing was the eye appointment.  Now the stress test I don't know but what I be thinking is that usually, the way I know about that appointment is you just send through the mail.  You know sometimes they'll call @@@ appointment, they even confirmed the eye appointment but I just got tied up for that appointment but I @@@.  But the stress test I don't remember that. Maybe I should give them the other number to get in contact with.

DOCTOR P805
I think so.

PATIENT P805
But my son he be on the computer and he be playing with the video games, sometimes he don't answer the phone and @@@.

DOCTOR P805
Alright and the liver doctors can’t do anything for you until we get all this stuff figured out.

PATIENT P805
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P805
Okay.

PATIENT P805
Well what am I supposed to do about my foot, @@@?

DOCTOR P805
Well you get to Podiatry.  I can't help you.  I mean there's nothing I can do for your feet okay.  Lotion is the best thing, that's all I know.  They probably need to biopsy the skin.

PATIENT P805
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P805
Okay and give you special shoes.

PATIENT P805
But what I think @@@ I think there's a piece of glass in my foot.

DOCTOR P805
That doesn't cause blisters, but I'll take a look at it.

PATIENT P805
Yeah because I had uh, it’s been there @@@ stepped in a lot of glass @@@.

DOCTOR P805
They're not painful right?

PATIENT P805
What the blisters?  Yes they are.

DOCTOR P805
They are.  Take them off and let me see.  I'm going to take care of your feet.  I'm more worried about your heart and your liver working so you need to survive.

PATIENT P805
Alright.

DOCTOR P805
Right.

PATIENT P805
Alright.

DOCTOR P805
We got to get you that stress test.  Your blood pressure's too high still.

PATIENT P805
That's because I'm in a lot of pain with my foot.  @@@ right in the middle.

DOCTOR P805
Uh-huh and I'll check your vitals and we'll check it in a second.

PATIENT P805
The blisters had on my feet @@@.

DOCTOR P805
Are you taking your blood pressure medicine?

PATIENT P805
Yes.

DOCTOR P805
Every single one of them?  Do you know which ones you're taking?

PATIENT P805
Yes.

DOCTOR P805
Which ones?

PATIENT P805
Name them?

DOCTOR P805
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P805
Uh metoprolol or whatever it is.

DOCTOR P805
Metoprolol good.

PATIENT P805
And the uh lisinopril.

DOCTOR P805
Good.

PATIENT P805
And uh a water pill.

DOCTOR P805
Hydrochlorothiazide good.

PATIENT P805
Yeah I tell you I wasn't taking that other one because it @@@.

DOCTOR P805
@@@ okay that's fine.

PATIENT P805
Uh-huh.  See I take those three.

DOCTOR P805
Okay.  Have you ever tried the Telebuddy System?

PATIENT P805
What's that?

DOCTOR P805
Where they actually call you about your blood pressure every day and you submit it electronically?

PATIENT P805
No, I got a blood pressure gauge.

DOCTOR P805
Would you like that?

PATIENT P805
What for that.

DOCTOR P805
You take your blood pressure at home with a certain machine that submits it electronically so we get the information.

PATIENT P805
Okay.

DOCTOR P805
Because your blood pressure has been too high for over a year and a half now.

PATIENT P805
It goes low once I get home.  The last time I took it at home it was about 120.

DOCTOR P805
Okay.

PATIENT P805
@@@ you know.

DOCTOR P805
Okay what is it running at home though?

PATIENT P805
Uh for the last uh month or so it's been running like about 129/80, in the lower 80s something like that.

DOCTOR P805
Okay well then I think it'd be good to have you have blood pressures at home then.  Look at ours, every single one that we have here.

PATIENT P805
I think I be, it's a little more stressful for me to come up here.

DOCTOR P805
I'm sure it is.  I'm a stressful person.

PATIENT P805
(Laughter).

DOCTOR P805
Well see we've only got these here.  That’s why I think it'd good for you to have one of those Telebuddy Systems then we'd know what your blood pressure is at home.

PATIENT P805
Okay.

DOCTOR P805
Cause you're right, your blood pressure may be better at home but I can't know that until we check it at home and I find out the answer okay.

PATIENT P805
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P805
So let's try that alright.  Alright, you also need to be on a cholesterol medicine that we need to add today.

PATIENT P805
Cholesterol.

DOCTOR P805
Your cholesterol is too high.  Your bad cholesterol we want for you less than 70 and yours is 134.  We need to cut your cholesterol in half okay.  And for that reason, I think you need to go on Zocor or Lipitor which is a cholesterol medicine alrighty.

PATIENT P805
@@@.

DOCTOR P805
You're African-American; you're almost 60 years old.

PATIENT P805
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P805
You have hypertension and diabetes so right there those are four.

PATIENT P805
Hepatitis C.

DOCTOR P805
What, well hepatitis C is pretty much equivalent to diabetes, in my mind it is diabetes okay.

PATIENT P805
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P805
You have four things okay that would put you at risk for heart attacks.

PATIENT P805
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P805
Which will now give you five with high cholesterol so all of these things we need to treat.  We're trying to treat your blood pressure, we can't change your race, we change your age okay.

PATIENT P805
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P805
But we can change your cholesterol.

PATIENT P805
So what was that pill I was on.

DOCTOR P805
The cholesterol.

PATIENT P805
I know, I understand, what kind of side effects is there?

DOCTOR P805
Side effects, the only kind of side effects is it might cause a little bit of muscle ache, so it's the most prescribed pills in America, is Lipitor.

PATIENT P805
Yeah I've heard that.

DOCTOR P805
Yeah.  That’s because it saves lives.

PATIENT P805
Okay.

DOCTOR P805
Okay.  So we'll put you on a low dose and increase it as you need it.

PATIENT P805
Alright.

DOCTOR P805
That sound good, I think it's important.  Alright.  Are you still taking the meloxicam?

PATIENT P805

DOCTOR P805
That's the only thing @@@.  These are rubbing blisters.

PATIENT P805
Are they?

DOCTOR P805
Yeah I mean they look very much like rubbing blisters to me.  Okay.  It's possible though that it's chronic inflammation because you're rubbing like this.  That may feel better if you pop it a little bit.

PATIENT P805
I did.

DOCTOR P805
Okay.

PATIENT P805
It came back again.

DOCTOR P805
