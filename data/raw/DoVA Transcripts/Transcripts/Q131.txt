PATIENT Q131
Uh I been okay I guess.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay.

PATIENT Q131
Yep.

DOCTOR Q131
Good uh.

PATIENT Q131
Can't really complain.

DOCTOR Q131
That is good to hear.  I see your blood pressure's a little bit high today though.

PATIENT Q131
Well I just came straight from Physical Therapy.

DOCTOR Q131
I saw that, I saw that, yeah.

PATIENT Q131
So that was probably it.

DOCTOR Q131
Physical Therapy was for your back huh?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah for the lower back.

DOCTOR Q131
How's that been doing?

PATIENT Q131
I don't know it's really changed that much yet it's.

DOCTOR Q131
Has it gotten any better?

PATIENT Q131
Maybe just a little bit but not a whole lot so.

DOCTOR Q131
So remind me, what happened to your back?

PATIENT Q131
Uh.

DOCTOR Q131
@@@ I don't think I remember that.

PATIENT Q131
No you didn't, the arthritis doctor did I think.

DOCTOR Q131
Oh gotcha.

PATIENT Q131
Because they were saying that I got arthritis in the back and the shoulders and the knees.

DOCTOR Q131
@@@.  I gotcha.

PATIENT Q131
Uh before I forget it, all of your prescriptions DOCTOR you need to renew the prescriptions.

DOCTOR Q131
I will take care of that today.  Yep that's not a problem.  I'm just uh taking a second to catch up on what you've been doing.  There are a lot of Rehabilitation Notes in here.  You've been to the MOVE Program.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
That looks good. @@@ better than when I last saw you.  Following up with Anticoagulation.  How about the liver, have you seen the liver guys?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah uh, they told me I got the hepatitis C.

DOCTOR Q131
Uh-huh.  Okay. 

PATIENT Q131
But they said, the way I understand it it's in the mid stages.

DOCTOR Q131
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q131
So I don't really need any treatment at this point, just try to keep everything.

DOCTOR Q131
Just keep following with them yeah.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
And we're not drinking anymore right?

PATIENT Q131
No I haven't had a beer in almost a year so, any kind of alcohol that I know of intentionally so.

DOCTOR Q131
Gotcha.  

PATIENT Q131
Maybe that's why I've dropped about 27 or 28 pounds.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah and that'll help your blood pressure too uh.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
Seen here for follow-up.  Have you been trying to lose weight?

PATIENT Q131
Not really no, I just.  When I'm hungry I eat and when I'm not hungry I don't eat which.

DOCTOR Q131
Gotcha.

PATIENT Q131
It seems like I used to get a craving for something and couldn't figure out what I was craving so I'd nibble everything and never find it but I haven't been getting that craving so I guess.

DOCTOR Q131
You may just be eating less.

PATIENT Q131
That's all that I can think of.

DOCTOR Q131
Uh-huh.  Okay good.  So looks like you've been doing pretty good.  How's your diabetes been doing?

PATIENT Q131
Diabetes?

DOCTOR Q131
How's your sugars?  Have you been eating okay?

PATIENT Q131
I guess so, I didn't know.

DOCTOR Q131
Well we started you on metformin I believe.  A medicine to control your sugars.

PATIENT Q131
I don’t…

DOCTOR Q131
Have you been taking that?

PATIENT Q131
I.

DOCTOR Q131
Let's run through your medicines and figure out what you're taking and what you're not, how about that?

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
Um so there's a couple of creams here, I’m not too interested in those.  The Coumadin you still take right?

PATIENT Q131
Right.

DOCTOR Q131
It looks like that needs a refill.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah it does.

DOCTOR Q131
Just in the mail?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
And you follow at the Coumadin Clinic?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah I follow up with that.

DOCTOR Q131
Alright.  The stomach medicine?

PATIENT Q131
The what?

DOCTOR Q131
There's a stomach medicine omeprazole.

PATIENT Q131
Oh that's that little capsule for the.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah.

PATIENT Q131
For the.

DOCTOR Q131
Acid reflux?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah and you take that right?

PATIENT Q131
I'm still taking that yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
Valsartan, that's a medicine for uh blood pressure.

PATIENT Q131
Okay the little white pill?

DOCTOR Q131
I don't know the color of it.  You take the blood pressure pill Valsartan?

PATIENT Q131
There's two or three, three I can't remember which ones.  There's three of them.

DOCTOR Q131
Uh how about tramadol?  That was one of the pain pills.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah that was the, the arthritis doctor gave me that.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay.  Digoxin?

PATIENT Q131
Digoxin yeah I got that.  It's the third blood pressure pill.

DOCTOR Q131
It helps with your atrial fibrillation.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
For rate control.  Um metoprolol?

PATIENT Q131
Okay the metoprolol I'm taking.

DOCTOR Q131
You're taking 100 mg; you take that twice a day right?

PATIENT Q131
Twice a day yeah, one pill I cut it in half and one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay.

PATIENT Q131
Half in the morning and half in the.

DOCTOR Q131
Alright let's see, looks like they gave you some prednisone for a short time, that's gone okay.  That's mostly your medicines, is that right?

PATIENT Q131
That sounds like it.

DOCTOR Q131
Next time I want you to bring the medicine bottles in or bring a list of what you uh for sure take.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
But that's what I got on the list here.

PATIENT Q131
Okay but I don't have anything for diabetic that I know of.

DOCTOR Q131
The last time we talked about but we didn't give it to you.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah something about the blood count was close or whatever so we didn't.

DOCTOR Q131
Right.  That's why we sent you to the MOVE Clinic.

PATIENT Q131
Oh.

DOCTOR Q131
Now I remember.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
Now I remember.  Um did you eat anything this morning?

PATIENT Q131
Nope.

DOCTOR Q131
No okay.  We may draw some labs.  Your Coumadin level's been pretty good.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
Let see what your sugars, this was last June.  So last June you had some labs drawn in June.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
By 9 o'clock in the morning.  Do you happen to remember if you had eaten that day?

PATIENT Q131
I don't think I did.

DOCTOR Q131
You don't think you did.

PATIENT Q131
Uh uh.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay. 

PATIENT Q131
Cause most time when I come here I don't eat.

DOCTOR Q131
You don't eat just in case huh.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
Alright.  So the other thing is before your glucose was 146, so it's better um.  We're going to draw some labs today.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
Depending what your sugars are.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
I might want to start you on a medicine for pre-diabetes.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.  Pre-diabetes, does that mean, to intercept sort of.

DOCTOR Q131
You're right, from getting full-blown diabetes.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
The way we diagnose diabetes is we take your blood.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
And look to see what the sugar level is.  If the sugar is 125 or higher, two separate times after you haven't eaten for 12 hours or so then we can say you have diabetes.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
You're right on the border so back in June you were 126, that's elevated.  When I saw you before you were 140, also elevated.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
So those two together we basically can diagnose you with diabetes.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
But because you've been doing good, you lost some weight, you went to the MOVE Clinic, they exercised you right?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah but actually uh I didn't lose it during the whole time I was with the MOVE Clinic I didn't lose one single, yeah I lost one pound.  I've lost all this weight since I left the MOVE Clinic.

DOCTOR Q131
Huh.

PATIENT Q131
I don't know if it's just now starting to catch up with me or if it's because I quit drinking the beer or what it is.

DOCTOR Q131
That could be, that could be.  Um.

PATIENT Q131
Cause I quit drinking the beer after I found out about the hepatitis.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay. 

PATIENT Q131
And then I never really drank a lot of beer, that was just like maybe two beers a day was about it so.  I don't think that's that much.  Saved me a lot of money though.

DOCTOR Q131
We just recently diagnosed you with that hepatitis right?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah, yeah, within the last, about a year.  You suspected a year ago and you finally finished all the tests maybe six or seven months ago.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah.

PATIENT Q131
To confirm it.

DOCTOR Q131
And we think that may be from a blood transfusion back when.

PATIENT Q131
Right.

DOCTOR Q131
You had the surgery for your stomach.

PATIENT Q131
Right and then that's another thing, I applied for the VA benefits to be increased and they sent me a letter of rejection saying of course I can re you know.

DOCTOR Q131
Reapply?

PATIENT Q131
Reapply or whatever within the year but they said that they didn't think that that transfusion, it was so long ago, would have give it to me.  But it's a possibility for me to have it ever since then and not really know about it right?

DOCTOR Q131
Right yeah.  I think we talked about that last time.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
And I put it in the note here.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah and I know they had access to the records.

DOCTOR Q131
Right.

PATIENT Q131
And everything so.  But what I'm not quite understanding they said something about they were holding at 20%.  I think that means they raised it by 10% because I been drawing 10% so I'm not quite sure if they raised it a little bit or not.  Cause I just got the letters recently so.

DOCTOR Q131
Let's see did they weigh you today?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
They did, let's see what.

PATIENT Q131
She did.

DOCTOR Q131
Your weight is 244.

PATIENT Q131
I was down another pound or two so.

DOCTOR Q131
So you were 258 yeah so that's good, let's see where you were a year ago.  Yeah that's pretty good.

PATIENT Q131
A year ago.

DOCTOR Q131
That’s pretty good. @@@ something we're concerned about.

PATIENT Q131
A year ago I was up probably somewhere around 260 or 270 I'm guessing.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah you were 270.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah 270.

DOCTOR Q131
270.5.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
Today 244.

PATIENT Q131
So that's close to.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah.

PATIENT Q131
Getting close to 30 pounds.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah, that's about 30 pounds, just under 30 pounds.  So that's pretty good and you've been trying to do better?

PATIENT Q131
Well actually I haven't been trying at all, it's just.

DOCTOR Q131
You haven't been trying at all.

PATIENT Q131
Not really.

DOCTOR Q131
So sometimes that can be concerning.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
Losing weight without trying.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
That can be concerning.

PATIENT Q131
Well, my diet has changed because I'm not, so well I eat a lot more fruit and stuff than I was before.  I love fruit.

DOCTOR Q131
So you're eating healthier.

PATIENT Q131
Probably yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
Did the MOVE Clinic help with anything?  They tell you how to eat better?

PATIENT Q131
Well that's one thing they did do because I've always liked fruit and everything and they kind of led me along the lines of stuff that I like pretty well but I wasn't really eating a whole lot that I like but so that kind of switched.  So they did have me switch my diet a little I think so that.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay.  Um you still live with your wife right?

PATIENT Q131
Correct.

DOCTOR Q131
And before you told me you were sleeping in different rooms because your wife moves too much?

PATIENT Q131
No she says I move too.

DOCTOR Q131
You move.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.  She says I get to screaming and hollering for some reason.  I couldn't see where it would be my military experiencing causing any of that though so.

DOCTOR Q131
Alright.  Alright.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah they got me on that sleeping thing too but that doesn't seem to me that it's doing.

DOCTOR Q131
What oh CPAP machine?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
That's good, that'll help your blood pressure.

PATIENT Q131
Well, it takes me twice as long to go to sleep and then I wake up about every 30 minutes or so where before I used to go to sleep real quick and not wake up so.

DOCTOR Q131
But they, I think I ordered that for you.

PATIENT Q131
Ah somebody did, yeah, yeah you did.

DOCTOR Q131
So they said you're having sleep apnea huh?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah, it's not real bad just slight you know.

DOCTOR Q131
You been using that sleeping machine all the time?

PATIENT Q131
I'd say 90% of the time.

DOCTOR Q131
Well that probably could help you lose weight too, believe it or not.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.  I been probably about 90% of the time I use it.  When we went on our vacation we were camping out in the woods, there was no electrical so I didn't use it that week.

DOCTOR Q131
Right.  No that's okay.  Where'd you camp at?

PATIENT Q131
Uh Devil's Den in Arkansas.

DOCTOR Q131
Do you feel like you're more awake now?

PATIENT Q131
Uh.

DOCTOR Q131
Do you feel like may have more energy?  Cause sometimes when you have sleep apnea you get tired during the day.  

PATIENT Q131
Uh, I seem to stay awake a little bit better but yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
You don't feel as fatigued huh?

PATIENT Q131
I still feel fatigued quite a bit but not quite as much as I did I guess maybe it's just, I'm not sure if it's that or not.

DOCTOR Q131
You know seems like everything got a little bit better.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
We may have done something right.

PATIENT Q131
Yep.

DOCTOR Q131
And I would tell you that we probably should get another colonoscopy but you just had one, just had one.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah I just had it.

DOCTOR Q131
Last year so.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
You're good to go.

PATIENT Q131
Well they told me I was good for another ten years.  I tell you what the pre-treatment's worse than the.

DOCTOR Q131
That's the worst.  Did I do that to you?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
I think I did do that to you.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah, yeah you did.

DOCTOR Q131
Well we're getting you squared away though.  The only thing I want to see is when was the last time you had your cholesterol checked?

PATIENT Q131
God I'm not sure.

DOCTOR Q131
That may have been a little while.

PATIENT Q131
I thought that was.

DOCTOR Q131
That was last September.

PATIENT Q131
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Q131
You're probably due for that.

PATIENT Q131
Hmm.

DOCTOR Q131
So we can probably check your lipids.  Probably check your BMP.  We can check an A1c.

PATIENT Q131
Well there's something else I want you to check, my left testicle for some reason.

DOCTOR Q131
What's happened?

PATIENT Q131
Uh it feels like, I feel uncomfortable, a little bit of pain in it, not a lot.

DOCTOR Q131
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q131
And feel a little bit of pressure, sometimes it comes uh and it's getting where it's more often.  The thing of it is if I don't go urinate or something.

DOCTOR Q131
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q131
And it relieves, and the pain and pressure seem to relieve and go away.

DOCTOR Q131
So pain in the left testicle right.

PATIENT Q131
Right.  It's not real severe but it's you know.  It's and it feels like pressure and pain a little bit.

DOCTOR Q131
Every day?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah at least once a day or so.  Uh usually like I say I go urinate or something and, I have no problem with urination or anything like that.

DOCTOR Q131
No problem.  Okay.  No burning.

PATIENT Q131
No burning, no nothing.  It's just.

DOCTOR Q131
So tell me more about your pain.

PATIENT Q131
It's almost like.

DOCTOR Q131
When did it come?

PATIENT Q131
Well, different, sometimes at nighttime, sometimes in the middle of the day just, never any set time it just uh.  Feels like somebody kind of taking hold of it and kind of squeezing it a little bit or something.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay.  What does it feel like, does it last a long time or is it just a few seconds?

PATIENT Q131
No it lasts until I go urinate or something.  It starts out slightly and then it starts getting a little bit more and more pressure and a little bit more pain until I go to the washroom or something, relieve myself and then it seems to go away then for a while.  Now this has been going on probably for two or three months now but I don't know how long it's been going on.

DOCTOR Q131
A few months?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
Hmm.  Alright well why don't I have you sit up there and uh I'll take your blood pressure first cause I want to check and see if that's for real or.

PATIENT Q131
Here?

DOCTOR Q131
It's probably just because you walked.  So you had rehab today?

PATIENT Q131
Yep.

DOCTOR Q131
What were you doing over there?

PATIENT Q131
They just had me doing.

DOCTOR Q131
For the back.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah it's for the back yeah they.

DOCTOR Q131
How's the back pain doing?

PATIENT Q131
It seems to be there all the time.  I mean it's not as severe as it was before but it seems like it ain't going away but.  It's been that way for years it seems like, just a.

DOCTOR Q131
A little squeeze sorry.  So it's definitely not as high as it was.  Sorry.

PATIENT Q131
No problem.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay, I got about 130/80.

PATIENT Q131
That's not bad.

DOCTOR Q131
Not terrible, not terrible.  Alright um, I'm going to examine you too.  I'll have you take some deep breaths.  Again.  Good, again, good, again.  Okay I'm just going to feel your pulse.  Okay.  You still have that irregular heartbeat.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah, I'll probably have that the rest of my life I guess.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah.

PATIENT Q131
And it seems like I'm.

DOCTOR Q131
Do you ever get swelling in the legs?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah from time to time.  Seems like I run out of breath a lot easier than.

DOCTOR Q131
Than before?

PATIENT Q131
Than before too now so.

DOCTOR Q131
Lay back.  I'm just going to feel on your belly a little bit.  So how far can you walk now?

PATIENT Q131
I don't know.  I really don't know.

DOCTOR Q131
You been doing physical therapy, you getting short of breath or no?

PATIENT Q131
No when I'm working upstairs, it's like when I go up the stairs or something.

DOCTOR Q131
Take your drawers off and we'll take a look at that.  When you go up the stairs you get short of breath?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
How far can you go?

PATIENT Q131
I don't know I'm not really trying but just seem like I'm winded when I get to the top of the stairs where I used to.  Drop the drawers and everything all the way down?

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah.  I'll take a look here.

PATIENT Q131
I've never really tried to see how far I could go or anything.

DOCTOR Q131
But you notice that now you can't go as far?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay.  Have you ever had a stress test?

PATIENT Q131
Been a long time but yeah I had one.

DOCTOR Q131
Show me where it's been bothering you the most.

PATIENT Q131
Right in through there.

DOCTOR Q131
Is it sore where I touch?

PATIENT Q131
No.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay.  I'm just going to check you for a hernia okay.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
Go ahead and cough.  Again.  Same on the other side, cough.  I don't see anything obvious.  I'll ask my attending and see if we need to check the urine to make sure there's no infection in there.

PATIENT Q131
Okay. 

DOCTOR Q131
Um I'll see if he wants to come take a look at it.  The stress test was taken a long time ago right.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.  Back when I first started.  The last time was when I first started coming here on a regular basis.

DOCTOR Q131
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q131
And that's when I wanted because I already knew I had the a fib.  

DOCTOR Q131
Sure.

PATIENT Q131
But of course they wanted their own you know, so that was the last time I took it, the chemical one or whatever.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah.

PATIENT Q131
@@@.

DOCTOR Q131
No that's okay.  I'm just going to see when you had a stress test last.  You had a treadmill.

PATIENT Q131
I don't remember doing a treadmill.

DOCTOR Q131
Sorry, I lied. Well this was in August 2009 they did an echocardiogram.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
Did I do that?  That might have been something I ordered hmm.  But that looks pretty good.  Yeah that one's pretty good.  So the symptom of shortness of breath is only with exertion right?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
That's when you start to get a little more winded?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay.

PATIENT Q131
Just normal walking around it doesn't seem like.

DOCTOR Q131
Oh when you.

PATIENT Q131
Like when I ride the bike over there, it didn't seem to bother me.

DOCTOR Q131
You have to ride a bike on a stationary place?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
When does it seem to come, going up and down the stairs?

PATIENT Q131
Going up and down the stairs, something like that or outside when it's real hot, on a real hot day.

DOCTOR Q131
Do you think you could walk on a treadmill if we wanted you to?

PATIENT Q131
Sure.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay.  I'll talk with my attending about that.  I want to get some labs for you too.

PATIENT Q131
Okay is that going to be done today or?

DOCTOR Q131
Hopefully yeah, the labs.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q131
I'm just going to go talk with him and then we'll go from there okay.

PATIENT Q131
Alright.

DOCTOR Q131
Alright hold on one second.  So, it says 20% service-connected right?

PATIENT Q131
That's what it says?

DOCTOR Q131
That's what it says in the computer.

PATIENT Q131
Yeah before it was only 10% so I guess that they must have upped it.

DOCTOR Q131
They may have.  Alright I'll be back in one second, okay.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
Hang tight for me.

(DOCTOR OUT:  63:55  DOCTOR IN:  73:22)

DOCTOR Q131
Alright so, here's what we're going to do for you, couple things.  We're going to check the labs like we talked about.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
Uh I also want to order two tests one is an ultrasound of your testicle making sure that there's no hydro-seal, there's no signs of cancer in there.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
No problems that I couldn't find on examining you.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
It feels to me like it's pretty benign.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
Depending what that shows we may send you to the urologist.  Now your symptoms don't sound too concerning and because they're mild I'm willing to watch them for a bit and see what happens with them.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
Also number two, because of your increasing shortness of breath I want to do a stress test.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
Okay.

PATIENT Q131
So all these, not today it's going to be.

DOCTOR Q131
No, no, no.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
The ultrasound and the stress test are not going to be today correct.

PATIENT Q131
Okay, but the lab.

DOCTOR Q131
The labs will be today.

PATIENT Q131
Well I just go down, that's blood right?

DOCTOR Q131
You just go down or they can draw them here.

PATIENT Q131
It doesn't matter to me if they want.

DOCTOR Q131
If you want to just get them here I can put you in the Lab here, it might be quicker.

PATIENT Q131
That's fine.

DOCTOR Q131
Let me just, let me just order those labs so I can set you up there and get you in line.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
Um we're going to order a bit.

PATIENT Q131
Okay you're going to redo all my prescriptions.

DOCTOR Q131
I refilled them all already.

PATIENT Q131
And you're going to add that one for the.

DOCTOR Q131
What for.

PATIENT Q131
For the pre-diabetes or whatever.

DOCTOR Q131
Um I'm going to check a lab today called hemoglobin A1c.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
That'll tell us how your sugars have been over the last three months.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
If that's high I'll send you a prescription for diabetes medicine okay.

PATIENT Q131
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR Q131
Um we're going to check your lipids.  I'm also going to check what's called alpha fetoprotein.  We checked that before.  We're going to check it again.  That's what monitors how your liver's doing.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh okay.  Yeah the liver doctor said something about technically they should be checking that every time I come in anymore.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah I'm going to check it now since you're here.

PATIENT Q131
That again will be with the Lab right?

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah, uh-huh.

PATIENT Q131
So really once I leave the Lab I don't have to go anywhere today except.

DOCTOR Q131
Home.

PATIENT Q131
Then they'll be calling me and making.

DOCTOR Q131
Yep they'll call you and get the ultrasound and the stress test taken care of.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
So let's see I just got to figure how to order that alpha fetoprotein.

PATIENT Q131
Beats me.

DOCTOR Q131
Make sure that you give them urine too.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
And we probably should check your prostate, so a PSA.

PATIENT Q131
I thought you did that once before.

DOCTOR Q131
We did.

PATIENT Q131
And it came back clean but it still you can't be.

DOCTOR Q131
This is something you check about once a year.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.  Just as long as it ain't nothing like that colon thing.

DOCTOR Q131
No this is a blood test.

PATIENT Q131
Whew.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah that was bad huh?

PATIENT Q131
Man drinking that stuff, I couldn't even get off the pot; I just sit there and drain.

DOCTOR Q131
Sorry about that.

PATIENT Q131
When they said it'd be ten years before I have to take it again maybe by then they'll have something better.

DOCTOR Q131
Yeah.  Ten years before you have to do it again and at that time you may consider not even doing it you know.

PATIENT Q131
If I live to be another ten years old.

DOCTOR Q131
Right exactly.  Alright so let's see here, the ultrasound, scrotum.  I'll order it today and I'll tell them in the front.

PATIENT Q131
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q131
So.

PATIENT Q131
They'll take my urine sample here too?

DOCTOR Q131
Yep.

PATIENT Q131
Okay.

DOCTOR Q131
So I'm going to order a stress test and we're all set to go.  Stress test. What we're going to do is instead of the treadmill; well you could probably walk on a treadmill right?

PATIENT Q131
Yeah I don't.

DOCTOR Q131
What we'll do is you'll walk on the treadmill and then they'll give you.

PATIENT Q131
The chemical.

DOCTOR Q131
They'll give you an echo.

PATIENT Q131
Oh that's a.

DOCTOR Q131
And they may give you a chemical.  If you can't get your heart rate fast enough.

PATIENT Q131
Will they give me the, I had that chemical done to me twice, once by you guys and once by.

DOCTOR Q131
Oh you had a stress test before?

PATIENT Q131

DOCTOR Q131
I don't see it in here.

PATIENT Q131
You guys gave me one once, when I first.

DOCTOR Q131

PATIENT Q131
When I first started coming here on a regular basis, that's before you guys would give me the medication and everything for the a fib.
