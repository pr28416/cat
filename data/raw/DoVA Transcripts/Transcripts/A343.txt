DOCTOR A343
Good to see you again. 

PATIENT A343
Yeah.

DOCTOR A343
It's been a while.

PATIENT A343
Yeah it has.

DOCTOR A343
I think I met you one time right?

PATIENT A343
Yeah once or twice.

DOCTOR A343
Back in like September of last year.  How have things been?  I saw you were recently in the hospital for a day or so.

PATIENT A343
Yeah I was having uh respiratory problems.  I was short of breath and I'd run my medication out and with the heat that we were having at 10 o'clock. 

DOCTOR A343
I think you called August 6th.

PATIENT A343
I was in on the 7th I think.

DOCTOR A343
For a refill.

PATIENT A343
It might have been yeah either the 6th or 7th is when I came in.

DOCTOR A343
Yeah and no it shows that same day you went into the Emergency Room.

PATIENT A343
Yeah, yeah it was that day.

DOCTOR A343
Hmm.  Next time call earlier.

PATIENT A343
Oh yeah, that's right.

DOCTOR A343
Why didn't you call earlier?

PATIENT A343
I really just lost track of it.  Cause I'd been pretty much surviving on my back-up.

DOCTOR A343
What's your back-up?  The albuterol or?

PATIENT A343
That one I've got listed.  Proventil.

DOCTOR A343
Okay.  Yeah the albuterol.  Um how many times a week have you been using the albuterol?

PATIENT A343
Um two, maybe three times a week.  Not so much lately now that the weather is cooling off again.

DOCTOR A343
Okay.  Two or, say it again once or twice a week?

PATIENT A343
Twice.

DOCTOR A343
Twice a week.

PATIENT A343
Yeah.

DOCTOR A343
What's your current asthma medication regimen?

PATIENT A343
Uh it's, if I saw it I'd know it.  I can't think of it off the.  It's the thing that counts off, does this look like.

DOCTOR A343
Mometasone okay so you're taking that.  How often are you using that?

PATIENT A343
Once a day.

DOCTOR A343
Okay and then what about, are you using any like nasal spray or anything like that?

PATIENT A343
I got a nasal spray that I use from time to time but it's not, it's not a regular day to day thing.

DOCTOR A343
Okay and you haven't seen the pulmonary doctors in a while right?

PATIENT A343
Right.

DOCTOR A343
Were you using a medicine called, let's see, flunisolide, the nasal spray is flunisolide right and you're using mometasone.  What about someterol?  Were you ever on that medicine?

PATIENT A343
Not that I can remember.

DOCTOR A343
And your breathing since you've been discharged in August?

PATIENT A343
Fine.

DOCTOR A343
Fine of using albuterol twice a week and your mometasone once a day.

PATIENT A343
Once a day yeah.

DOCTOR A343
And um no coughing, shortness of breath or anything?  Good.  What was the trigger?  Like what brought you in?

PATIENT A343
Well I think it was the humidity and the heat and I cut my own grass and I do stuff around the house so uh.  You know whatever outside allergies there might be but I don't necessarily, I'm not necessarily affected by.

DOCTOR A343
Okay.

PATIENT A343
But the combination of the heat.

DOCTOR A343
Running out of your meds.

PATIENT A343
Yeah.

DOCTOR A343
Where do you get the albuterol from?  You don't have that listed in our medicine regimen.

PATIENT A343
No when in remission.  I get it here.

DOCTOR A343
You get it from here?

PATIENT A343
Yeah.

DOCTOR A343
Mometasone.

PATIENT A343
That's what I get.  Right.

DOCTOR A343
And you have enough of these at home?

PATIENT A343
Uh and I had another one in 2000.

DOCTOR A343
Make sure that gets on your medicine list.  Um how have other things been going?

PATIENT A343
Everything's been going, oh I was wondering if I could get a reinstatement on that @@@ that I was getting.

DOCTOR A343
Sure.

PATIENT A343
On a monthly basis.

DOCTOR A343
So you saw that, I think it's @@@ to some of your testosterone levels, your free testosterone levels came back a little low which could be contributing to your erectile dysfunction.

PATIENT A343
That could have been it.

DOCTOR A343
How is your mood and are you like you know.

PATIENT A343
My mood.

DOCTOR A343
Your libido, like you're feeling.

PATIENT A343
Oh I feel good.

DOCTOR A343
Okay.

PATIENT A343
That might be a little low too cause I haven't been, you know like I said I haven't had that medication at all and uh, I haven't been as active as I was so.

DOCTOR A343
Well you know it might be worth treating it then, so we can just put like a @@@ might consider a patch but uh a testosterone patch, that can help replace the testosterone.  It's actually quite common you know in men in their 60s and 70s.  If you have a deficiency but uh, yeah like yours was, your free testosterone was 0.9 and 1.5 is the lower end of normal.  Yours is definitely low.  One thing we could do is repeat it and see where you are today and then consider putting you on that.

PATIENT A343
Yeah I would repeat it and see where we're at with it after.  It's been a while since I had that vardenafil.

DOCTOR A343
How many times are you have sexual intercourse?

PATIENT A343
Uh well more like once a month.

DOCTOR A343
Once a month?  Okay.

PATIENT A343
Currently.  

DOCTOR A343
Um okay so the last time you were here we measured your prostate-specific antigen, the PSA.

PATIENT A343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A343
A blood test that kind of measures the growth of your prostate um and it can be used for screening for colon cancer or prostate cancer but it has some downfalls um.  We talked about that last time, it giving false positives.

PATIENT A343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A343
@@@.  But then yours has elevated from 06 to 07 it went up kind of quickly but then from September of 07 to January 09 it was more or less the same.  I definitely want to repeat that.

PATIENT A343
Yeah I think in April is when I had the colonoscopy.

DOCTOR A343
Yeah you had the colonoscopy in April of 09.  That showed one small polyp.

PATIENT A343
Yeah they removed that.

DOCTOR A343
They removed it.  It was a tubular adenoma which is a benign growth but it's actually not entirely benign in the sense that it could, has the potential to develop into a malignancy but that takes many years.  That's why they do a colonoscopy to catch things like this.

PATIENT A343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A343
They're recommending getting a repeat colonoscopy in five to seven years.  I prefer to get it in five because you’re young and otherwise healthy.

PATIENT A343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A343
We want to make sure we don't miss anything.  Um, are you having any like urinary symptoms like a weak stream, dribbling stream?

PATIENT A343
Sometimes weak.

DOCTOR A343
Sometimes weak.

PATIENT A343
Yeah.

DOCTOR A343
How many times a night are you going to the bathroom?

PATIENT A343
Uh generally I'm waking up once a night.

DOCTOR A343
Once night, not too bad.  What about intermittency where you start and stop when urinating?

PATIENT A343
Maybe once.

DOCTOR A343
Once in a while?

PATIENT A343
Once in a while.

DOCTOR A343
So we'll get that repeat colonoscopy in 2012.  Looks like you're up-to-date on all your shots.  The flu shot is coming like in a week or so.

PATIENT A343
Okay.

DOCTOR A343
So make sure you come and get that.

PATIENT A343
I'll come and get it.

DOCTOR A343
Um.

PATIENT A343
I had the pneumonia I think a couple years ago, shot.

DOCTOR A343
Are you able to come back to get some fasting blood work because I want to check.

PATIENT A343
Sure.

DOCTOR A343
Your cholesterol, I want to check your prostate antigen, I want to check some screening for diabetes.

PATIENT A343
Actually I have, I could do it today if you want.

DOCTOR A343
Are you fasting?

PATIENT A343
I haven't had anything since 6 or 7 last night.

DOCTOR A343
Coffee?

PATIENT A343
Nothing.

DOCTOR A343
Okay let's do it, let's do it today then.  Um I want to check a few things.  So if that testosterone comes back low I'll find out today or tomorrow, would you consider going on the testosterone patch?  It's a patch you wear on your arm, it has to be removed and changed once a day but you know it might give you energy.  It might give you more libido.

PATIENT A343
Sure.

DOCTOR A343
It might help with erectile dysfunction.

PATIENT A343
Yeah.

DOCTOR A343
Now remember next time, even if your asthma's under great control, next time you run out of your medicines.

PATIENT A343
Then just get it.

DOCTOR A343
Oh you know a week ahead of time call.

PATIENT A343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A343
And it’s hard to keep track of everyone and I hadn't seen you in a long time.

PATIENT A343
Yeah so, it'd been quite a while.

DOCTOR A343
Um which one did you run out of, was it the mometasone or the albuterol?

PATIENT A343
It was the one that uh, I think it’s mometasone.  The albuterol I had.

DOCTOR A343
Okay have a seat up hear so I can have a listen to you.  Do you get any chest pain or pressure when you exert yourself?  

PATIENT A343
No.

DOCTOR A343
Okay.  @@@.  Take some deep breaths in and out.  Appetite's good.

PATIENT A343
Yeah.

DOCTOR A343
Any change in your weight up or down?

PATIENT A343
No.  I'm still at 160.

DOCTOR A343
Swelling in your feet or legs?

PATIENT A343
No swelling problems, no swelling.

DOCTOR A343
Sleeping okay?

PATIENT A343
Yeah.

DOCTOR A343
Bleeding or bruising anywhere? 

PATIENT A343
Uh uh.

DOCTOR A343
Moving your bowels?

PATIENT A343
@@@ yeah.

DOCTOR A343
Okay good.  Alright let me go talk to DOCTOR or one of the other supervising doctors and I'll be back shortly okay.

PATIENT A343
Okay.

DOCTOR A343
Get some blood work done today.  I want to have you come back, you know things are going okay now but of course if things change we'll see you sooner.

PATIENT A343
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR A343
But maybe six months okay?

PATIENT A343
That's fine.

DOCTOR A343
And I'll stay in touch.  I'll give you a phone call about the testosterone and.

PATIENT A343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A343
The other blood work if it's abnormal.

PATIENT A343
Okay.

DOCTOR A343
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  42:36  DOCTOR IN:  49:48)

DOCTOR A343
So everything is the exact same as I talked about. 

PATIENT A343
Okay.

DOCTOR A343
With one minor exception, I just read your labs when we checked them.

PATIENT A343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A343
Your percent free, I'm just telling you why I can figure it but the percent free testosterone for you was low but that doesn't really mean anything cause your total testosterone and your total free testosterone were high.

PATIENT A343
Oh good.

DOCTOR A343
So adequate.

PATIENT A343
Good.

DOCTOR A343
So we don't need to recheck the testosterone today.

PATIENT A343
Okay good enough.

DOCTOR A343
I'll just give you the refills on the medicines.  Um and I'll see you back in six months okay.

PATIENT A343
Okay.

DOCTOR A343
You can go just across the way to get labs done okay.

PATIENT A343
Sure.

DOCTOR A343
And I'll send it up to the Lab. 

PATIENT A343
So now where do I need to go for that?

DOCTOR A343
Right here.

PATIENT A343
Oh okay.

DOCTOR A343
