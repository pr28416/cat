These are just pain medications to kind of help but it doesn't, it's not curing anything.

PATIENT W204

Why do he have it when he was 20?

DOCTOR W204
I don't know him.  I don't know why he had it when he was 20.

PATIENT W204
I talked to him and he said that he got a cream, he said a Benadryl cream.

DOCTOR W204
Benadryl cream.

PATIENT W204
The doctor gave him the Benadryl cream and he had it about a month and that was it.

DOCTOR W204
Yeah.  I don't know what Benadryl cream is.  I don't know what he had.

PATIENT W204
Yeah he got the shingles.

DOCTOR W204
Yeah.

PATIENT W204
When he was 20.

DOCTOR W204
That's odd to get it in your 20s.

PATIENT W204
Yeah I talked to another guy and he said that he had it when he was 40.  So why did I wait until I'm 74 and then I get it?

DOCTOR W204
Some people, people get it at different times.  It's hard to say.  Not everybody gets it at 20 or 40 or 50 and some people don't ever get it.

PATIENT W204
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR W204

DOCTOR W204
Your blood sugars?

PATIENT W204

DOCTOR W204
Yeah we're gonna have to add another medication, is that okay?

PATIENT W204
No.

DOCTOR W204
Why not?

PATIENT W204
What other medication, I'm taking enough.

DOCTOR W204
Well probably either glyburide or it’s another pill.

PATIENT W204
Uh let me continue with this one and then I give you the ideas.

DOCTOR W204
But your blood sugars are too high.

PATIENT W204
Not too high because the 170s, probably if they go over 400s and 300s.

DOCTOR W204
Yeah but 200 is still high.

PATIENT W204
And they came down to 200 and they came down to 179s.

DOCTOR W204
That's still too high.  We want it below 1, you know around 120.

PATIENT W204
Uh give me the time and we’ll find out, because I just started.

DOCTOR W204
In the beginning of March.

PATIENT W204
Yes that started, that's what it takes but I didn't know.

DOCTOR W204
But that's long enough.

PATIENT W204
I think that's what it takes.  Let me continue with this and find out.

DOCTOR W204
Okay.  You know it puts you at higher risk of having a heart attack right.

PATIENT W204
Ah.

DOCTOR W204
And it's probably why your shingles isn't healing.

PATIENT W204
What about that cause the shingle now, let me continue with it 200 and find out.

DOCTOR W204
Okay.

PATIENT W204
Because it’s too soon. Too soon to try it.

DOCTOR W204
Alright.  Your blood pressure's too high too.

PATIENT W204
Yeah but @@@ sometimes its high, sometimes it’s okay.

DOCTOR W204
But you're taking the medications?

PATIENT W204

DOCTOR W204
10 okay.

PATIENT W204
Amlodipine I'm taking it 10 mg..

DOCTOR W204
If we can increase the glipizide, I don’t know if we can, but would you be okay with that?

PATIENT W204
With what?

DOCTOR W204
With increasing the glipizide?

PATIENT W204
No.  Because I'm taking glipizide and I'm taking metformin.

DOCTOR W204
I know but your blood sugar is too high.  Are you, did you take the enalapril today?

PATIENT W204
Yeah.

DOCTOR W204

DOCTOR W204
Would you be okay with adding another medication for your blood pressure?

PATIENT W204

DOCTOR W204

DOCTOR W204
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W204
Taking pantoprazole and taking enalapril.

DOCTOR W204
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W204
That's enough pills for one person.

DOCTOR W204
Are you taking amlodipine or not?

PATIENT W204
I am taking amlodipine.  That's too many pills for one person.

DOCTOR W204
Uh the problem is your, okay you know the risks though.  Your blood pressure's too high, you can have a stroke.

PATIENT W204
The blood pressure's go high and the blood pressures go down, blood pressures go down, blood pressure was 252 and it went down right now to 179, 160, 149.

DOCTOR W204
Yeah but that's still too high.

PATIENT W204
139, you want it 120 right?

DOCTOR W204
Yeah I do.

PATIENT W204
Yep, 120.

DOCTOR W204
Alright, let’s work on your diabetes first, that's the main thing.

PATIENT W204
Sometimes it goes down; blood pressure goes down, goes up and goes down.

DOCTOR W204
Alright, we're gonna see you back in a month.  If your blood sugar is still too high.

PATIENT W204
Yeah.

DOCTOR W204
We're gonna have to add something or go up on one of your medications.

PATIENT W204
Yeah.

DOCTOR W204
Okay.

PATIENT W204
Yeah.

DOCTOR W204
Is that okay.

PATIENT W204
Yeah one month, yeah.

DOCTOR W204
In one month and it may have to be insulin.

PATIENT W204
No, I don't want to do it.

DOCTOR W204
Even if it means you could die?

PATIENT W204
Exactly.  I don't want no insulin.

DOCTOR W204
Okay well I want you to think about it.

PATIENT W204
@@@.  Sometimes it coming up and exercise and other stuff @@@.  What I want to do is get rid of this pain.

DOCTOR W204
We'll work on the pain okay.  But that's also not going to get better if your blood sugar is too high, your body can't fight infections.

PATIENT W204
That so.

DOCTOR W204
And that's what's happening.  So shingles is an infection.

PATIENT W204
They say that shingles come from a virus.

DOCTOR W204
Yeah it is a virus and that's an infection and your body can't fight it if your blood sugar is too high.

PATIENT W204
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR W204
Yeah.

PATIENT W204
Hmm, what can they do for the blood sugars?

DOCTOR W204
That's what I'm saying.  We could either increase, I don't know I have to check if I can increase your glipizide but I think you might be on the maximum dose and then we would have to add insulin.

PATIENT W204
Maximum dose of what?

DOCTOR W204
The glipizide, the 10 mg.

PATIENT W204
@@@ diabetes, I be taking the glipizide, I'm taking enough glipizide.

DOCTOR W204
Well for some people that's enough but for you it’s not.  Your diabetes is more severe.
