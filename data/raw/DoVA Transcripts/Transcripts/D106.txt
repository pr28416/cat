Time of Encounter:  @@@@

DOCTOR D106
PATIENT?

PATIENT D106
Oh, oh you wanna fight?

DOCTOR D106
No, (laughter).  @@@, yeah that's @@@.

PATIENT D106
You better be good to me or I will end up.

DOCTOR D106
Let's see, yes you can.  I apologize for that, I didn't mean it to be such a public thing.

PATIENT D106  
I didn't either, ha, ha.  Sit here?

DOCTOR D106
Yeah.  You mainly see DOCTOR?

PATIENT D106
Right.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.  Do you know why you're here today?  You're in the hospital is that right?

PATIENT D106
I work in the hospital.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.  How have been sick?

PATIENT D106  
Fine.

DOCTOR D106
Do you walk?  Sounds like your heart was beating fast.

PATIENT D106
Right.

DOCTOR D106
Uh, they started you at base, increased some of your medicines and started you on . . .

PATIENT D106
They changed some medicines too and that's what I want to talk to you about.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.  So let's take a look at the medicines and then you can tell me your questions.  Looks like you're on Coumadin, which is new.

PATIENT D106  
Right.

DOCTOR D106
A blood thinner.

PATIENT D106
So it's not new.  I was on it before @@@ and I was taken off of it.

DOCTOR D106
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D106
Now I'm back on it.

DOCTOR D106
Okay and then um digoxin. 

PATIENT D106  
They put me on that when I got out of the Hospital.

DOCTOR D106
And then a water pill, Lasix, furosemide.  

PATIENT D106
Yep.

DOCTOR D106
Metoprolol?

PATIENT D106
Right, taking it while I was in the hospital.

DOCTOR D106
And then isosorbide mononitrate?

PATIENT D106  
Yep.

DOCTOR D106
And then @@@.


PATIENT D106
Yeah.

DOCTOR D106
Lisinopril?

PATIENT D106
Yes half a pill in the morning, half in the afternoon and half in the evening.

DOCTOR D106
Magnesium?

PATIENT D106  
Yes.

DOCTOR D106
Diltiazem?

PATIENT D106
Yes.

DOCTOR D106
And then B12 shots.

PATIENT D106
Right.

DOCTOR D106
And then glipizide.

PATIENT D106  
Glipizide which I'm almost out of, which is doing absolutely no good.

DOCTOR D106
Cause your sugars are high?

PATIENT D106
Yeah.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.

PATIENT D106
They took me off of.

DOCTOR D106
Metformin?

PATIENT D106  
Metformin and uh gluco.

DOCTOR D106
Gliburide.

PATIENT D106
Glucophage.

DOCTOR D106
It's because of your kidneys um.  Your kidney function is not normal anymore and metformin is actually dangerous in people with kidney functions that were not normal so that's probably why.

PATIENT D106
Oh.

DOCTOR D106
And then they didn't, you know, give you something to kinda help with the diabetes so.

PATIENT D106  
Right.

DOCTOR D106
Um.

PATIENT D106
And the glipizide is not doing it.

DOCTOR D106
You're taking 10 mg twice a day.  That's the maximum dose actually so.  Have you ever taken anything else for your diabetes?

PATIENT D106
Well uh, let me think it's so many years ago.  Uh, the metformin and the Glucophage have been here at Hines.

DOCTOR D106
What's your blood, what's your blood sugar now?

PATIENT D106  
Well in the morning it's been as much as 150-160.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.

PATIENT D106
In the evening it's around 290.

DOCTOR D106
Wow.  That's pretty high.

PATIENT D106
Yeah and I had perfect control with the . . .

DOCTOR D106
The metformin.

PATIENT D106  
With the metformin.

DOCTOR D106
It's just that it's very dangerous with your renal function so we have to figure out something to help you out.  Now were you having heart failure when you came in, swelling in your legs, anything like that?

PATIENT D106
Well I had some little swelling in my right ankle and I wear elastic stockings for that.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.

PATIENT D106
That seems to control it.

DOCTOR D106
Let's see cause we're kind of limited by what we can give you by mouth um.  There's one medication that we can try um but it's associated with swelling in the legs and you were here last time with a little bit of heart failure and so if I give you that medicine.

PATIENT D106  
I didn't have heart failure I had a high pulse.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah it sounded like when DOCTOR wrote the sign-off note for you she mentioned that you had a little bit.  So we can try that medication and if you start noticing that your swelling in your legs gets out of control then um perhaps we can try a different medicine.  Cause, so there's only, metformin is the best medication for diabetes.  Next is the glipizide that you're taking now um and then the other ones are just A OK and then the next step would be insulin but that's you know that's a big hassle, a big lifestyle change.

PATIENT D106
Right.

DOCTOR D106
And we want to try to avoid that.

PATIENT D106
Yeah I do too.

DOCTOR D106
So, yeah we can try you on this new medication and it's called pioglitazone um.  The side, the main side effect is swelling in the legs okay, which I'm kind of worried but um we can try that okay.  Uh let's see what's the last time DOCTOR checked your diabetes @@@.

PATIENT D106 
Uh-huh.
 
DOCTOR D106
The last time your control was actually really good and that was in the beginning of November but if you're telling me your blood sugars have been high we should . . .

PATIENT D106
Well that, the blood sugars are that high since they took me off of the metformin.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah I understand that.  Okay, we'll try this new medication and then, and then see how your sugars improve okay.

PATIENT D106
Okay.

DOCTOR D106
Um if anything um maybe DOCTOR just wanted to start you on a little booster, one time a day, of insulin instead of you know.  Cause insulin is done multiple ways.  But let's try this one medication and see how it goes.  So that's one thing your diabetes.  Um, your heart rate today is well controlled; it was 67, so that's good.  I think all the medications they put you on um helped that.  Um how often do you @@@?

PATIENT D106  
Feel fine.

DOCTOR D106
You feel good?

PATIENT D106
Yeah.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.  Um, so we'll get some blood work today to check all of that stuff again.  I know you got some about two weeks ago.

PATIENT D106
That Coumadin is.

DOCTOR D106
Sticker right?

PATIENT D106  
Look at that (shows arm).

DOCTOR D106
@@@.  It does that.  It thins your blood you know.  It prevents strokes that's the thing so.  Um alright.  Any other questions about the medications?  What else you got?

PATIENT D106
Well, I don't know yet the effect of the other medications cause I haven't been on them that long.

DOCTOR D106
Okay, so do you want to discuss, I mean kind of ask me questions like what they’re for? Do you want me to answer questios like that?

PATIENT D106
Well uh I know most of them are for the uh.

DOCTOR D106
The heart rate.

PATIENT D106  
The heart rate.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah.

PATIENT D106
Yeah.

DOCTOR D106
The only thing is your blood pressure is a little high but I'll recheck it today.  Does your blood pressure get a little more on the high side?

PATIENT D106
It must.  I can’t explain it to you and almost all my life, it's been in the upper readings.  It's been around 140-150.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.

PATIENT D106  
And the lower reading has always been in the low 60s, that's what diastolic, in the low 60s, but the same reason that I've had a high pulse without realizing it for maybe 15 years.

DOCTOR D106
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D106
You know I just noticed it when I go in the stores and I checked it at the store machine which shows a high pulse of 90, 100.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah.

PATIENT D106
90s, 100s.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah.

PATIENT D106  
In that area.

DOCTOR D106
The thing is um, they both are you know connected.  The fact that you've had your blood pressure on the little higher side for so long, your heart structurally the muscles pump against a higher blood pressure and so the muscles, over time, stretch, over like say the you know before you get the high high blood pressure.  So the more the muscles stretch and then, so the inner connections are loose and hence your heart beats faster.

PATIENT D106
But I never, I've never had high blood pressure until ten years ago.

DOCTOR D106
Oh ten years ago?

PATIENT D106
Maybe not even that long ago.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.  So I think the key to preventing your heart, well you're hearts already in that faster rhythm, but controlling your blood pressure is key.  We can still go up on the lisinopril.

PATIENT D106  
Well I took lisinopril I'd say about 15 years or 20 years ago, back when I started on it with Doctor @@@.

DOCTOR D106
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D106
And uh when I was taking more of a dose than I'm taking now, which is a half a tablet in the morning, half in the evening uh I, my lisinopril causes my potassium to go up.

DOCTOR D106
I see.

PATIENT D106
So I don't know if you want to increase the lisinopril and automatically increase.

DOCTOR D106
Then your potassium is high.  You're very right, you're very right.  Um well other things, the other thing is we'll just go up on your, will just raise, make your heart rate go down even more and at this point, your heart rate is pretty low so.  We don't want to drop it too low.

PATIENT D106  
No I don't want to drop it too low either.

DOCTOR D106
So that doesn't make you feel good.  Um, let's see.  We can go up on the water pill, the furosemide.  Go up to twice a day.  It makes you pee, you probably know that.

PATIENT D106
I do that anyhow.

DOCTOR D106
But the, the nice thing is because your potassium tends to be on the higher side, so the furosemide actually drops your potassium so maybe that can counteract a little bit.  So maybe we'll go, would you rather take twice the dose in the morning or would you rather split it in two doses twice a day?

PATIENT D106
It doesn’t make any difference.

DOCTOR D106
@@@ okay.  Let's do it twice a day then.

PATIENT D106  
Okay.

DOCTOR D106
I think it's more effective @@@.

PATIENT D106
Okay I am almost out of glipizide because . . .

DOCTOR D106
Okay.

PATIENT D106
I got two pills left.

DOCTOR D106
Cool, alright.  You need that too.  Okay, you want to come up here?  How about @@@.  I'll just have you come back for blood work in about two weeks.

PATIENT D106  
I've gotta come back for blood work on December 9th.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.

PATIENT D106
For the Coumadin check.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.

PATIENT D106
So do want to do it then?

DOCTOR D106
Let's do it then, yep, yeah let's do it all then.  I think that’s good.

PATIENT D106  
That's only six days from today.

DOCTOR D106
Do you want to pick up the new pill downstairs or do you want to mail it?

PATIENT D106
If they mail it takes about four days.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah.

PATIENT D106
Well I have enough for a week.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.  So the furosemide you just double it.  Just take one in the morning and one at night until we.

PATIENT D106  
Will they mark that on the prescription?

DOCTOR D106
Oh yeah when you get it yeah.

PATIENT D106
Okay.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.  I can write it down for you if you want.  

PATIENT D106
Right.

DOCTOR D106
Do you have your med list?

PATIENT D106  
Furosemide twice a day.

DOCTOR D106
Here, your med list is right here.  I'll just mark it on here.

PATIENT D106
You got your notes on that; don't you want to keep those?

DOCTOR D106
No there up here, so it's good.

PATIENT D106
Oh.

DOCTOR D106
Change to twice a day.  Okay um and then I'll send the new diabetic medication then too.

PATIENT D106  
Okay.

DOCTOR D106
You can start that today.

PATIENT D106
So I can’t get started today I'll stop and pick it up right?

DOCTOR D106
Um exactly.

PATIENT D106
Yeah.

DOCTOR D106
So I'll send it.  I @@@.

PATIENT D106  
Do I take that new diabetic medicine at night or in the morning, when?

DOCTOR D106
Take it in the morning.

PATIENT D106
Just once a day.

DOCTOR D106
Yes, once a day.  I'll be right back okay?

(DOCTOR OUT:  39:53  DOCTOR IN: 40:44)

DOCTOR D106
Deep breath please.  Other side.  @@@ okay thank you.  You're heart is regular today so.

PATIENT D106
Oh.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah.  The Coumadin.

PATIENT D106  
That's what drives me nuts.

DOCTOR D106
Okay.

PATIENT D106
@@@.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah you know the Coumadin is one of the downfalls of medicine.  It works because it does what we need it to, which is prevent stroke but.

PATIENT D106
Yeah.

DOCTOR D106
But the complications of bleeding and like you know so difficult to monitor.

PATIENT D106  
Oh it's terrible.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah so I mean.

PATIENT D106
I get the blood tests every two weeks.

DOCTOR D106
So but once you start getting more control I think it's the management that @@@ once you get more regular.  I think you're in that early period where.

PATIENT D106
Well I was in the @@@ for six years.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah I know.

PATIENT D106
And they took me off of it because my echocardiogram was perfect and my uh, the EKG was perfect and the heartbeat was perfect and everything.  Then I went off of it for a month and now it’s all screwed up.
  
DOCTOR D106
Yeah. Screwed up.  Let me look at the dose then.  @@@.  So once a day.

PATIENT D106
Should I watch for swelling in the legs or what?

DOCTOR D106
Yeah.  So if you start noticing increased swelling in the legs give me a call or give DOCTOR a call and then we'll have to come up with other options.  @@@.

PATIENT D106
Well I don't, because @@@ swelling and just.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah massive swelling.

PATIENT D106  
Oh geeze.

DOCTOR D106
Yeah.  

PATIENT D106
I don't know that I didn't want to take that.

DOCTOR D106
Well it doesn't, you know it's just about maybe 10% of people get it, so.  The majority of the time it doesn't happen.

PATIENT D106
Okay.

DOCTOR D106
Or happens in a small amount.  Alright I'll be right back okay sir, I'm going to talk to my attending and uh I'll be right with you okay?

Alright sir.  So actually that water pill, my attending wanted just to do it once a day to make it easier for you.
