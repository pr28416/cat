DOCTOR A320  
Hello PATIENT.

PATIENT A320
Hello.  

DOCTOR A320
How are things going?

PATIENT A320
Fine.

DOCTOR A320
Fine okay.  Well my name is DOCTOR.

PATIENT A320
Hi.

DOCTOR A320
Uh I'm going to be your primary care physician and I was just, I think I was expecting you in July but you didn't come.

PATIENT A320
Yeah I totally forgot the appointment.

DOCTOR A320
Yeah and then uh, it looks like you had @@@ scheduled @@@.

PATIENT A320
Oh, I have, an unpredictable schedule.

DOCTOR A320
Oh okay, alright so all I have here for PATIENT uh, it looks like the main issue right now is high cholesterol and you had a surgery of uh your ankle.

PATIENT A320
Yep.

DOCTOR A320
Left ankle and then I think that's about it of what we have in the chart so far.  You don't have much issues going on?  Okay and then you come here for yearly check-ups.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
How's your ankle doing?

PATIENT A320
It always hurts.

DOCTOR A320
Oh okay.

PATIENT A320
Uh there's nothing.

DOCTOR A320
Why did you get a surgery for it, do you know?

PATIENT A320
Yeah um I basically broke my ankle back in '88.

DOCTOR A320
Oh in 1988 and you had surgery for how many different times?

PATIENT A320
Seven.

DOCTOR A320
@@@ when was the last time?

PATIENT A320
January @@st in @@@@.

DOCTOR A320
Okay and uh and your feeling is it's not getting any better?

PATIENT A320
It’s always there.

DOCTOR A320
Uh do you take any pain medication for that?

PATIENT A320
Oh I was on Vicodin and I had, but it was only if I need it and I ran out.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.

PATIENT A320
And I just never came back for it.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  Um but you're doing fine without that or do you want more?

PATIENT A320
There's some days I'd like to have.

DOCTOR A320
Like to have.  Vicodin is a little stronger, have you tried Norco?

PATIENT A320
That's all they gave me was.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.

PATIENT A320
Two 60 prescriptions of 30.

DOCTOR A320
Oh okay.  Oh lets try Norco then because you weren’t taking too much Vicodin alright?

PATIENT A320
Well just when I really.

DOCTOR A320
Just when you really need it.

PATIENT A320
When I really need it.

DOCTOR A320
Yeah.

PATIENT A320
I just take one or two for a day or so, because with me driving a truck I can't, you know I can't take one now and then go drive.

DOCTOR A320
Right.

PATIENT A320
Cause you know it puts you to sleep.

DOCTOR A320
Yeah have you tried Norco or no?

PATIENT A320
Oh I don’t even know what it is.

DOCTOR A320
Oh okay.  Maybe we can try that.  Uh and the Naproxen you take that pain medication too?

PATIENT A320
I'm out of that.

DOCTOR A320
Oh okay and then you take this two times a day?

PATIENT A320
Um pretty much.

DOCTOR A320
Or only when you need this?

PATIENT A320
I didn't even realize it was expired.

DOCTOR A320
Oh so you don't even use it then?

PATIENT A320
Well I use it but it's just as I need it.

DOCTOR A320
As you need it okay.  That's a good way to use, so you don't have to schedule this um, it's just use it like you're using right now because there's always risks in these medications and you know it makes you dizzy, the Vicodin makes you dizzy and Norco can hurt your kidneys so it's better if you don’t need it, don't take it okay um.

PATIENT A320
So what's the cholesterol at?

DOCTOR A320
Let's see cholesterol, you had it today right?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
I haven't looked at it yet.  I was going to see before I see you.

PATIENT A320
@@@.

DOCTOR A320
@@@ so let's see 136.

PATIENT A320
Is that high?

DOCTOR A320
So let's see, so what you have your age is, how old are you?

PATIENT A320
48.

DOCTOR A320
48 so you're young and um 136 for you.  You don't have hypertension right?

PATIENT A320
No.

DOCTOR A320
So 136 is good for, not too bad actually.  Um I think for your goal it should be um so you're 48 and uh, do you smoke?

PATIENT A320
No.

DOCTOR A320
Ever?

PATIENT A320
No.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  So since you never smoked, your goal would be 160 for the LDL.

PATIENT A320
So I'm under.

DOCTOR A320
You're under yep so this will be fine for that.

PATIENT A320
So I just cut the breads out and starches and I’ll be alright.

DOCTOR A320
What?

PATIENT A320
So I just cut the potatoes out.

DOCTOR A320
Wait a minute, so it's your diet you're watching now right?

PATIENT A320
I'm trying.

DOCTOR A320
It's not the breads actually.

PATIENT A320
Oh.

DOCTOR A320
It's the um like uh red meat, uh cholesterol, what else do eat, hamburgers?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.  We eat red meat.

DOCTOR A320
If you eat meat, there's a lot of cholesterol um, what else, what else, cheese, butter that kind of stuff.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
Those are high in cholesterol I'd say.  Um otherwise if you basically if you eat like a healthy diet and you take out the fats -  okay, fish, vegetables, fruits, that's kind of stuff.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
Lower cholesterol so I want you to eat those kinds of stuff.  Um so you're watching your diet?

PATIENT A320
Yes.

DOCTOR A320
That's good and uh you're a exercising?

PATIENT A320
Not as much as I should but.

DOCTOR A320
Not as much as you should okay.

PATIENT A320
No.

DOCTOR A320
So you know it's hard when you have a job and all.  I can't exercise either so.

PATIENT A320
Well my job is just terrible you never know when you're gonna work so it's just like now.

DOCTOR A320
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A320
They could call me and I'd have to be at work in two hours.

DOCTOR A320
Oh really.

PATIENT A320
I don't have a set schedule.

DOCTOR A320
You're like on call all the time?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
That's tough.

PATIENT A320
It sucks.

DOCTOR A320
And do they call you at night too?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.  They call me any time of the day every half hour, @@@.

DOCTOR A320
How long do you have to work after that?

PATIENT A320
14.

DOCTOR A320
When you don't get a call do you work 14 hours?

PATIENT A320
Up to 14 hours and then we'll get 10 hours off and then they call you again.

DOCTOR A320
Oh so you don't, you can't predict when you're working the next time?

PATIENT A320
Nope.

DOCTOR A320
Wow, that's a tough job.

PATIENT A320
Then after we do six days we get 2 1/2 days off.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  So that's on that cycle where you get six days and 2 1/2 days off.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.  Cause like right now, this week here, is where we got messed up because I got robbed on Sunday, I tried to replace all my cards, I went to work for one day and then I didn't want to miss this so I took a sick day so it'll be next weekend before I get off again.

DOCTOR A320
Oh so you took a sick day for this one?

PATIENT A320
Yeah just so I could make, so I could make it.

DOCTOR A320
Oh thank you so much for coming.

PATIENT A320
So.

DOCTOR A320
I see.  So you're, so you don't have like a protected weekend, it depends on the schedule?

PATIENT A320
It just depends on my schedule.  I try to get the weekend but a lot of times it's Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Thursday, Friday.

DOCTOR A320
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A320
You know.

DOCTOR A320
Okay and then you have, recently you had a sleep study done here.

PATIENT A320

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  Okay.  Um so for today, so I didn't see any shots given to you uh in the computer.

DOCTOR A320

DOCTOR A320

PATIENT A320
I don't know I just don't.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  You don't think that it's worth it?

PATIENT A320
No.

DOCTOR A320
It's free.

PATIENT A320
I know I just you know.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  I come from other country and in my country you have to pay $100 for.

PATIENT A320
Where?

DOCTOR A320
I come from Japan.

PATIENT A320
I lived in Okinawa and Hokkaido.

DOCTOR A320
Oh yeah.

PATIENT A320
I got lost in Tokyo for a day.

DOCTOR A320
Oh really.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Yeah then we have the American base there @@@.

PATIENT A320
Uh we did the walk up Fuji.

DOCTOR A320
Oh you did that, oh that's good, I want to go do that.

PATIENT A320
Did you do that?

DOCTOR A320
Oh no, no, no I can't do that.

PATIENT A320
I got my walking stick at home so.

DOCTOR A320
Did you go up into the @@@?

PATIENT A320
Yeah we were in the Marines, so they got a little base there.

DOCTOR A320
Oh.

PATIENT A320
@@@.

DOCTOR A320
So it's a part of your job?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Wow.

PATIENT A320
What part of Japan are you from?

DOCTOR A320
Uh I'm from uh a small place, Kyoto, do you know where Kyoto is?

PATIENT A320
@@@

DOCTOR A320
@@@.

PATIENT A320
@@@ parking garage where the cars go like this.

DOCTOR A320
Oh yeah, that's all the time, that's all the time.

PATIENT A320
Well it's the first you know.

DOCTOR A320
Because you know you have land here and we have very limited land so we have to yeah.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
And then the way we park, even if you don't have @@@ we have the cars like, our car you have to park like this you know so you have to, cause space is very limited so you can't park like this if the wall is here, you have to park like this all the time.

PATIENT A320
Oh I mean yeah, Okinawa when I was there, other than they didn't have no room to park.

DOCTOR A320
Right, right, so that's how it is okay.  So and the other uh shot I can give you is something called Tdap, this is something to prevent tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria.

PATIENT A320
I just had a tetanus shot.

DOCTOR A320
Yeah I know you had that in 2006.

PATIENT A320
No I had it in 2008, I stepped on a nail.

DOCTOR A320
You stepped on a nail okay.

PATIENT A320
Cause I couldn't remember if I had one.

DOCTOR A320
Uh so in 2008 I think you got a tetanus shot um because you stepped on a nail.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Um this one has tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, which is whooping cough.  Um sometimes you know uh it's not so popular right now but once you get it it's you have to cough a lot, you're uncomfortable, so if you can prevent it with a shot, I think you can just get a shot, so everybody below 65 we kind of have to recommend that to you so if you're interested we can give it to you.

PATIENT A320
Oh I'll get it next time.

DOCTOR A320
Next time okay.

PATIENT A320
Yeah. So what's up with the @@@?  Because my friend's got kind of like a cough like all the time, he just coughs.

DOCTOR A320
Uh I mean that's very common so I can't really tell.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
A small cough, I would say it's probably just like asthma or it probably came from a.

PATIENT A320
She smokes too so.

DOCTOR A320
Yeah smoking obviously can cause that.

PATIENT A320
We watched the movie Secret Agent.

DOCTOR A320
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A320
Have you seen that yet?

DOCTOR A320
Invasion?

PATIENT A320
About the spread of a virus.

DOCTOR A320
Oh I haven't seen that yet.

PATIENT A320
Oh we watched it last night and then everybody in the movie who started to get sick had that little (cough, cough) and she's like oh my God I got a cold.

DOCTOR A320
Oh.

PATIENT A320
@@@.

DOCTOR A320
That's a bad influence.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Oh.

PATIENT A320
It's kind of just like, did you ever seen the movie Outbreak?

DOCTOR A320
Uh actually no, so yeah.

PATIENT A320
It's about the Ebola.

DOCTOR A320
Ebola oh I see.

PATIENT A320
You know how that spreads and everything and.

DOCTOR A320
Wow.  Okay I need to discuss about an Advanced Directive.

PATIENT A320
Who?

DOCTOR A320
Advanced Directives like um something like Power of Attorney.

PATIENT A320
I have that.

DOCTOR A320
You do have that?

PATIENT A320
Yeah at home yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.

PATIENT A320
Well I have a no resuscitate.

DOCTOR A320
Oh you have no resuscitate, you want to do a Do Not Resuscitate?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
And why is that?

PATIENT A320
Uh I watched my mom and dad die and they kept trying and trying and trying and was nothing and.

DOCTOR A320
Oh okay.  Okay so if you can read this um and then you can call the number.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
And give the physical papers here so that everybody would know, they'll put it in your chart and uh.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
Then everyone will know that.  So the last time uh you had a fall before?

PATIENT A320
Yeah it was from my left ankle.

DOCTOR A320
Oh okay.  Did you just get @@@ in there?

PATIENT A320
Well, just when I step on it the ankle comes up towards me.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.

PATIENT A320
And it gives out for a second and I just fall over.

DOCTOR A320
Oh okay.  Do you take any medication other than from the VA?

PATIENT A320
Aspirin.

DOCTOR A320
Aspirin, baby aspirin 81 mg or is it for the pain?

PATIENT A320
It's just uh.

DOCTOR A320
Do you know why you take aspirin?

PATIENT A320
Yeah it's just for the pain; I took it when I ran out of.

DOCTOR A320
Oh okay.

PATIENT A320
Either Advil or Tylenol.

DOCTOR A320
Advil, Tylenol, okay.  And you don't want @@@ right?

PATIENT A320
@@@, sleep last night.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  So and your blood pressure looks okay.  Any symptoms going on?

PATIENT A320
No.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  @@@ cold.  How's your weight?

PATIENT A320
I'm heavy.

DOCTOR A320
You're heavy.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Oh but you were losing weight the time before, last year it was 330 and now it's 310.  So that's good.

PATIENT A320
It could be better.

DOCTOR A320
It could be better.  So losing weight is always better with other things.  Because it can prevent a lot of things um, maybe you've heard about diabetes, um hypertension.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
And those things, once you start having it, progresses and uh it lasts @@@ taken to the hospital but those @@@ going to be miserable and the hypertension and diabetes progress so you know it's better to steer people away from that from the first step so that you know you don't have to worry about that later on your life.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
So now you're fairly young so you're not worrying too much about that but it's always good to keep your lifestyle in good shape as far as weight, diet, exercise, those things so I would recommend that.  Um and then uh so finally can I see your feet and listen to your heart?

PATIENT A320
Sure.  You want the shoes off or?

DOCTOR A320
Yeah can you take your shoes off?

PATIENT A320
Both or just one?

DOCTOR A320
Um just your shoes and socks would be fine @@@.  Do you want to pick up your medications today or?

PATIENT A320
No they can mail them.

DOCTOR A320
Can mail it okay.  So I'll give you something called Norco if you don't mind and uh every four hour tab with it @@@.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
And we @@@ do that one and 90 day supply of those.  Probably if you had 120 pills, it will last for 90 days right?

PATIENT A320
Yeah we should go longer probably.

DOCTOR A320
Longer yeah and @@@ here.

PATIENT A320
What it is like, is it like Vicodin or what?

DOCTOR A320
It's generally the same.  The same thing is in it um something called um, has a narcotic, low does of a narcotic and a combination of acetaminophen @@@.  It's a painkiller you usually take when you have pain or something.  It can help improve pain, so Vicodin is also a combination but the narcotics they're using is slightly different so Vicodin is a little stronger than the Norco.  But I was thinking it you've never tried Norco before right?

PATIENT A320
No, so it's a little less Vicodin but a little more aspirin kind of?

DOCTOR A320
Oh let's see so it's a little bit less Vicodin and aspirin @@@ pain okay.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
Alright so I'll give you that.

PATIENT A320
It's always good when you have less.

DOCTOR A320
Okay, yeah.

PATIENT A320
You know.

DOCTOR A320
And uh we'll give you the Naproxen, how much are you taking?

PATIENT A320
Oh I don't remember.

DOCTOR A320
Uh 500 mg two times a day so I'll renew for one year as well.  So you take this only when you need it right?

PATIENT A320
That's all I take it yeah.

DOCTOR A320
So I think 120 pills will be okay and uh if you need a refill then let me know.  Okay so I'll examine you.  @@@ back?

PATIENT A320
Yes.

DOCTOR A320
Where's the pain?

PATIENT A320
Right in the @@@.

DOCTOR A320
Here?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.  Where it comes up, that's where it is.

DOCTOR A320
You  have pain here?

PATIENT A320
And up through there.

DOCTOR A320
You have a little bit of swelling here too.  Is it always like that?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Oh like you have some fluid there?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  @@@ okay you still want @@@?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Let me take a listen to your heart sir?  Deep breath for me please.  Take a deep breath, breathe out, once more, breathe out, once more.  Breathe out, once more, breathe out.  Good.  Open your eyes.  @@@.  Stick out your tongue ah.

PATIENT A320
Ah.

DOCTOR A320
Move your tongue, good.  Okay.  So I think that's about it.  So you're doing well generally.  The only recommendation from me is that you can lose a little more weight um and I know that you have very irregular hours.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
So those stressful things can cause your blood pressure to go high or get it to go high so sleep as much as possible and increase that and @@@.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
So that you'll feel refreshed.  I think it was good that you got the CPAP cause that will help you sleep better.

PATIENT A320
Oh yeah I notice a big difference using it.

DOCTOR A320
Oh okay.  So you're not interested in prostate now.

PATIENT A320
No.

DOCTOR A320
And other things you don't need cause you're still young so and I think that's it for this trip and that's all I have.

PATIENT A320
So how's the iron?

DOCTOR A320
How is the @@@?

PATIENT A320
No how was the INR cause a couple years ago I had a little high iron.

DOCTOR A320
High iron?

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Uh I haven't checked the iron.

PATIENT A320
Well @@@.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.

PATIENT A320
The VA they had me have an ultrasound and said I might have a fatty liver but.

DOCTOR A320
You had an iron study, you had fatty liver on the ultrasound?

PATIENT A320
Well that's what they said but that's been years ago.

DOCTOR A320
Okay so I don't see an iron study here.  We haven't done iron studies here okay.  So I can recheck that, I'll call the Lab and see if they can add on to the labs we did for you this morning uh and see if we can, if we can't add it maybe you want to check it again.

PATIENT A320
Yeah I'll come back and take it.

DOCTOR A320
Yeah whenever you come back we'll check it then. (Doctor called Lab)  Well they will have iron studies with the lab this morning so I'll check the results and let you know if there's anything going on.  I think they were worried about something called hemochromatosis @@@.

PATIENT A320
Why is that?

DOCTOR A320
I'm not sure, I'm not sure, I'm not sure so I think they checked an ultrasound and they were finding your iron might be a little high.

PATIENT A320
Right.

DOCTOR A320
And that is something called hemochromatosis which is a disease that causes the iron to get stored excessively, not good with getting it out so you have a high level of iron so the iron was @@@ usually goes into the liver, to the pancreas and it can change the color of the skin and people get diabetes.  It's called bronze diabetes.  So your skin gets a bronze color and then @@@ completely so you don't have that as much and uh if they didn't say anything further then I'm not too worried about it.

PATIENT A320
Yeah they never said.

DOCTOR A320
Yeah so I just wanted to check it to see if anything has progressed with that and uh if there is any abnormal results I'll let you know.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  Um so I need to talk to my supervisor and then I'll come back very soon okay.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  66:28  DOCTOR IN:  71:21)

DOCTOR A320
Okay sir.  So the plan remains the same.

PATIENT A320
Yeah.

DOCTOR A320
Um I'll let you know as soon as I have the lab results.  Uh so when would you like to see me next time?

PATIENT A320
How long should I go I mean?

DOCTOR A320
Uh I think for you, everything is pretty stable, so a year should fine.  But if you wanted to see me earlier you an always schedule so it's up to you.

PATIENT A320
Oh yeah a year is fine.

DOCTOR A320
A year is fine okay.

PATIENT A320
So my cholesterol is 138?

DOCTOR A320
Uh yeah it's 136.

PATIENT A320
And the high side is?

DOCTOR A320
Your goal is 160.

PATIENT A320
Oh so I want to stay below 160?

DOCTOR A320
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
Below 160.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
Uh so this is not the total cholesterol, this is the bad cholesterol.

PATIENT A320
It's the bad.

DOCTOR A320
Yeah.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
So in total cholesterol, good cholesterol and bad cholesterol are totally included so we did look at the bad cholesterol which is called LDL and that level is for you the goal is less than 160.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
Okay.  So this goal is different in each person.

PATIENT A320
You go by age?

DOCTOR A320
Um we go by age and we go by other things that you have.  If you have like diabetes, you need more tighter control.

PATIENT A320
Oh.

DOCTOR A320
If you've ever had a heart attack, uh that takes more tighter control.

PATIENT A320
Right.

DOCTOR A320
So things like that.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
So if you develop some medical problems then your goal is becoming lower but for now your only risk factor right now is just age.  You're older than 45 and this is counted as more risk factor.

PATIENT A320
Okay.

DOCTOR A320
And that's it.  You don't have hypertension and you don't have other factors.

PATIENT A320
Alright what is hypertension?

DOCTOR A320
Oh high blood pressure.

PATIENT A320
Oh okay.

DOCTOR A320
It's hypertension.

PATIENT A320
Oh I didn't know what it was.

DOCTOR A320
You know so.

PATIENT A320
Yeah cause I don't have it, it was all normal.

DOCTOR A320
Yeah, a good thing.  Okay sir, so I have nothing to offer you today.

PATIENT A320
Yeah that's fine.

DOCTOR A320
You're in good and I will just order the medication for you and they can mail it to you.

PATIENT A320
