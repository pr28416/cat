Ah @@@ anything.

DOCTOR J584
But you do want it refilled?

PATIENT J584
Yes.  I still got pain in my knees.

DOCTOR J584
Okay.

PATIENT J584
That's because I just don't have no cartilage in there anymore.

DOCTOR J584
Yeah.  Did you have a procedure there or not, I don't remember.

PATIENT J584
No they just told me to exercise it.

DOCTOR J584

DOCTOR J584
You a Bears fan?

PATIENT J584

DOCTOR J584
We stopped them.

PATIENT J584
But I knew Green Bay was going to kick your ass man, I just knew it.

DOCTOR J584
Well what do you think about NAME, what do you think about that whole thing?

PATIENT J584
He's getting the shaft I think.

DOCTOR J584
Do you think?

PATIENT J584
Yeah.

DOCTOR J584
Do you think they told him to not come in?

PATIENT J584
Well not only that but you know it's not all his fault man.  We need an offense to do anything.

DOCTOR J584
Yeah.

PATIENT J584
You know.  And then once the doc tells you you can't go in, you ain't going in and you know.

DOCTOR J584
@@@.

PATIENT J584
@@@ not to you know.

DOCTOR J584
You don't think he kinda limped out a little bit?

PATIENT J584
Well yeah he did I think, I mean I do, but maybe next year.

DOCTOR J584
I just don't like his attitude.

PATIENT J584
Well he bums everybody out you know.

DOCTOR J584
That's the problem.  

PATIENT J584
He sat on that bench and pissed everyone off, you know.

DOCTOR J584
You know and that's not a good quarterback.

PATIENT J584
No.

DOCTOR J584
That's not a member of the team.  Deep breath, breathe out, breathe in, again.  Good.  Lay back for me.  You don't notice any water in your legs or anything?

PATIENT J584
No.

DOCTOR J584
All in all, he just, you can sit up.  @@@.

PATIENT J584
I know.

DOCTOR J584
I just don't like his attitude.

PATIENT J584
Yeah @@@.  You know he's shown that a few times already too you know.  That's where uh.

DOCTOR J584
And then he thinks he's getting the shaft but I think part of the time the problem @@@ by the way he carries himself.

PATIENT J584
Yeah I mean they say he's soft but I don't know where the ACL is in the knee, I imagine it hurts.

DOCTOR J584
Yeah but, Roethlisberger played on a broken foot.

PATIENT J584
Yeah I mean look at all @@@.

DOCTOR J584
NAME would have come in with his arm in a sling okay.

PATIENT J584
Yeah.

DOCTOR J584
You know.

PATIENT J584
Then they really messed up when they put that second quarterback NAME.  They should have put NAME in for him.

DOCTOR J584
Yeah.  Um.

PATIENT J584
But the offense really sucks; we got to get an offense.

DOCTOR J584
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT J584
A little bit yeah, I'm down to less than, well about a pack a day now.

DOCTOR J584
So what, what do you want?  Do you a patch or do you want the gum or do you want?

PATIENT J584
I can't chew gum I got dentures.

DOCTOR J584
How about the patch?

PATIENT J584
The patch I tried but it didn't work.  @@@.  You said you wanted to give me two of them @@@.  I'd probably be able to do this on my own.

DOCTOR J584
Well let me know which do you want, do you want to try to do it yourself and then if it doesn't work let me know?

PATIENT J584
Yeah.  Let's do that, you know I'm managing to quit all my other shit and.

DOCTOR J584
Okay.  So let's do that.

PATIENT J584
I'm down, I mean I was smoking about 2 1/2 packs and I'm down to.

DOCTOR J584
Good.

PATIENT J584
Oh yeah.  About a pack, little less than a pack a day now.

DOCTOR J584
Okay.

PATIENT J584
And I can't smoke at home cause my girls won't let me smoke in the house.

DOCTOR J584
Those are good girls.

PATIENT J584
Other than that, I don’t know, everything has been okay.

DOCTOR J584
Your labs are back and your liver function is a little high, @@@.

PATIENT J584
You when I talked to NAME she said I got a little bit of scarring on there.

DOCTOR J584
Yeah you do.  @@@.

PATIENT J584
What's that?

DOCTOR J584
It is going up @@@ 120, 130.  One the enzymes in your liver.

PATIENT J584
Oh.

DOCTOR J584
So you know.

PATIENT J584
Is it still going up now?

DOCTOR J584
Yeah the last time they checked it was in June of 10 and it was 120 and now January @@ it's 159, so.

PATIENT J584
That's not good huh?

DOCTOR J584
Not great but I mean the rest of your liver enzymes look pretty good.

PATIENT J584
Yeah.

DOCTOR J584
So that's good.

PATIENT J584
@@@ quit drinking.

DOCTOR J584
Yeah it is.  Hang on, so we'll see.  We'll see what they say.  Let me go check with my attending real quick uh.  

PATIENT J584
So you think you are going to get hold of Mental Health or am I?

DOCTOR J584
I think you are.

PATIENT J584
I need to go downstairs to I think don't I.  So I can make an appointment with them.

DOCTOR J584
@@@ Agent Orange @@@.

PATIENT J584
Oh yeah, well years ago back in the 70s I was tested down in Arkansas and I had but now they don't take it anymore do they?

DOCTOR J584
I’m sorry?

PATIENT J584
They don't, there's no claim for it anymore and they don't test for it anymore do they?

DOCTOR J584
They don't?

PATIENT J584
Not that I know of.  Cause I've always wanted to fight them on that cause my daughter's missing her five fingers on her one hand.

DOCTOR J584
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J584
You know.  @@@.

DOCTOR J584
Okay let me go ask him about the Mental Health and the meloxicam.

PATIENT J584
Okay doc.

DOCTOR J584
And @@@.

PATIENT J584
Sure.

(DOCTOR OUT:  52:04  DOCTOR IN:  60:35)

DOCTOR J584
Hey, okay.  So well this is done.

PATIENT J584
What's that the meloxicam shit, @@@.

DOCTOR J584
In your knee?

PATIENT J584
@@@.

DOCTOR J584
It can be.  So here's what @@@.  We could do @@@ I think you should probably see PT again for your knee because strengthening the muscles surrounding your knee is the best way to support your knee and decrease the pain um.  You saw them once before right?

PATIENT J584
Yeah.

DOCTOR J584
When was the last time, it's been a while ago right?

PATIENT J584
Yeah.

DOCTOR J584
Would you be interested in doing that or no?  

PATIENT J584
He told me, I mean he told me exercises @@@.

DOCTOR J584
Right.

PATIENT J584
Because putting in a new kneecap is @@@ specialist.

DOCTOR J584
So what do you think?

PATIENT J584
Uh I guess I'll give it a try.

DOCTOR J584
Alright.  So I'll do PT and then have you ever tried that capsaicin cream?

PATIENT J584
Yeah.

DOCTOR J584
Has it worked for you?

PATIENT J584
No.

DOCTOR J584
Not at all?  How long did you use it for?  You should give it about a month for it to work.

PATIENT J584
Oh yea?  No only used it for a couple of weeks.

DOCTOR J584
Do you want to try it again?

PATIENT J584
Sure.

DOCTOR J584
And the problem is that after like month beyond this, the next thing we do is Vicodin or like narcotics and someone with your history.

PATIENT J584
They don't want to give me Vicodin.

DOCTOR J584
But you know what I mean that's the problem.

PATIENT J584
Yeah.

DOCTOR J584
You know we're kind of running into a brick wall.

PATIENT J584
Yeah that's fine.  I mean I can deal with it.  The only thing is it's hard getting up and down.

DOCTOR J584
Well I'll write you for capsaicin, I'll write you for meloxicam again I'll just refill it.  The trazodone I'm going to let the Mental Health and you’re good to go see them and you need to make an appointment, it's been less than two years since you've seen them, so just call.

PATIENT J584
