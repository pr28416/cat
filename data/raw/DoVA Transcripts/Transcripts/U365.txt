PATIENT U365
Uh I used to do it every day and now I do it about twice a week.

DOCTOR U365
Okay.  I'm not happy with that.  Every day is much better.  I know it's hard sometimes but ideally I would say at least four times a week.

PATIENT U365
Well since I've been unemployed, you know uh my schedule has changed, now I'm driving my daughter to school every day and uh, to classes and uh, so what I do in the morning, instead of getting up and doing my exercising, then take a shower and leaving I'm getting up, taking a shower and dashing out the door to run my daughter to classes you know.

DOCTOR U365
I gotcha.  Are you saying, I know pressures and everything.

PATIENT U365
Yeah.

DOCTOR U365
But I still want you to exercise alright.

PATIENT U365
Okay.  You know @@@ started walking two miles.

DOCTOR U365
Okay.

PATIENT U365
I like walking you know.

DOCTOR U365
And walking outside is kind of usually not easy.  @@@.

PATIENT U365
No nothing, nothing.  @@@ Just so you know I've been putting on - my mother-in-law before she passed away two years ago now, she had, she was in her late 80s, she had a fungus on her feet.

DOCTOR U365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U365
And uh she was using an iodine soak you know.

DOCTOR U365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U365
And so I started using it, and thought maybe that would help it.  Iodine.

DOCTOR U365
Is it helping a bit?

PATIENT U365
Well it seems to be @@@ a little bit.  It looks bad but it could be worse.

DOCTOR U365
Did you ever use Lotrimin?

PATIENT U365
No.

DOCTOR U365
That should help it.

PATIENT U365
Oh okay.

DOCTOR U365
I think that should take care of it.

PATIENT U365
Put it on there.

DOCTOR U365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U365
Really.

DOCTOR U365
Yeah.

PATIENT U365
Okay.

DOCTOR U365
If that doesn't work I’ll have you see podiatry.

PATIENT U365
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR U365
I would just use that probably until we see if it's not working, takes about 14 days to work up, alright.

PATIENT U365
Okay, oh every day?

DOCTOR U365
Yes.

PATIENT U365
Okay.

DOCTOR U365
Use it exactly as the directions on the box.

PATIENT U365
Okay, alright, works for rash, okay.  Let me take my shirt off so I can show you.

DOCTOR U365
You know so many people walk in here.

PATIENT U365
Okay.

DOCTOR U365
@@@.

PATIENT U365
No @@@.  It gets real noticeable when I itch it and once in a while, and when it gets hot out gets really noticeable and then it spreads out @@@ and uh to my crotch uh, cool weather like this and if I keep myself powdered.

DOCTOR U365
Okay.

PATIENT U365
It's usually okay but um, I mean I'd never had it until I was in Vietnam.  I came back and when I came back from Vietnam I mean while I was there I got it.

DOCTOR U365
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U365
And when I came back I went to the, you know I'm not 100% what it is.  I've never, you know I've never seen anything like it alright.

DOCTOR U365
@@@ skin tags.

PATIENT U365
@@@ longer.  I can see it in the mirror.@@@.  Hold your hand.  @@@.

DOCTOR U365
@@@.  Like down here.

PATIENT U365
It gets real pronounced.

DOCTOR U365
Okay.

PATIENT U365
It gets real pronounced and if I sweat a lot then it gets tender and it moves you know.

DOCTOR U365
Well I think that's a lot of skin irritation from sweat, like sweating.  If it's in the arm pits and the groins, you actually do sweat there @@@.

PATIENT U365
Yeah I know @@@.

DOCTOR U365
@@@.

PATIENT U365
@@@ I mean cause I never had it until then it came.

DOCTOR U365
Yeah I know when, you know went to Vietnam.  So a lot of you guys go through a second stage of puberty.

PATIENT U365
@@@.

DOCTOR U365

PATIENT U365
Should I put my shirt on?

DOCTOR U365
Yes.

PATIENT U365
Okay.

DOCTOR U365
Um so you know, honestly.

PATIENT U365
You don't know.

DOCTOR U365
I mean what I would recommend right now is you continue keeping yourself you know use deodorant, dry uh and then but it's just, it's not something like @@@ from now.  I could have you see the dermatologist I just don't know if there’s an actual treatment for it it, other than just keeping this up with good hygiene.

PATIENT U365
Well, when my.  Here's the hook.

DOCTOR U365
Okay.

PATIENT U365

PATIENT U365
Intp the areas that I don't even you know, where they concentrate, and uh then when I came back I was living with my folks for a while.

DOCTOR U365

PATIENT U365
My ma used my towel and she got the same rash.

DOCTOR U365
Okay.

PATIENT U365

PATIENT U365
@@@,

DOCTOR U365

PATIENT U365
Okay.

DOCTOR U365
We'll see if they can figure it out, I'll see you down there.

PATIENT U365

DOCTOR U365

DOCTOR U365

DOCTOR U365
And if it's not we'll start you on some medications for that.  The other thing is you know you might have a fungal rash.

PATIENT U365
All these years?

DOCTOR U365
Yeah, possibly, we'll see.

PATIENT U365
I mean the VA doctors, like I said, disregarded it.

DOCTOR U365
No we'll check it out.

PATIENT U365
And then uh and then my regular doctors uh said well the one doctor said he thought it was ring worm and I says it's not ring worm and then he looked at it closer and he says no you're right it's not, it's some kind of fungus or rather some kind of rash and then uh my doctor that I had most recently said you know, he told me to come to the VA but I think I'm you know, I was turned down by you guys, I'm not going to come here again you know.  At that time, I wasn't signed up you know.

DOCTOR U365
No no problem.

PATIENT U365
I didn't want to bother you guys with that kind of you know uh thing since it was turned down but geez I you know.  Now that I'm in it, I figured well maybe you should take a look at it because it.

DOCTOR U365
Well it could not, but we’ll see if this works @@@.  Do you want this mailed to you or do you want to pick it up?

PATIENT U365
Whichever works you know.

DOCTOR U365
They'll send it in the mail to you.

PATIENT U365
Uh I could pick it up here you know.

DOCTOR U365
It might take a little while.

PATIENT U365
