DOCTOR L538 
PATIENT?

PATIENT L538
Yes.

DOCTOR L538
Go ahead and have a seat over there.  @@@.

PATIENT L538
That's okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR L538
Uh so how uh, so yeah I'm sorry to hear about that.  Yeah you got the lesion on the larynx there, I was hoping that wasn’t going to be what it was when I sent you there.

PATIENT L538
Yeah well.

DOCTOR L538
@@@.  So sorry.

PATIENT L538
Well the good news is they caught it in time.

DOCTOR L538
Yeah it looks like there's no spread and they're just going to pound it with the radiation.

PATIENT L538
Right and that should be okay.

DOCTOR L538
Okay that's good.  Uh alright and then you had some plaque in your cheek I guess that they biopsied.

PATIENT L538
Uh yeah they biopsied @@@.

DOCTOR L538
It doesn't look like it's anything major.  Alright well so but that pretty well, I mean the Ear, Nose and Throat guys are doing a good job.

PATIENT L538
Yeah.

DOCTOR L538
Um now the sugars, um what are you taking now?  You're still taking the metformin.

PATIENT L538
Uh the metformin and then uh Lantus.

DOCTOR L538
Lantus.

PATIENT L538
Lantus insulin.

DOCTOR L538
30 units?

PATIENT L538
Uh yeah but the thing that happened was they had been sending it to me and for some reason the post office would send it back.

DOCTOR L538
Oh okay.

PATIENT L538
And so my children @@@ go to the pharmacy @@@.  

DOCTOR L538
Alright so. 

PATIENT L538
So @@@.

DOCTOR L538
And when was that?

PATIENT L538
Oh that was Monday.

DOCTOR L538
Uh so you had not gotten it.  Cause I noticed some labs from December and uh the hemoglobin A1c was doing a little worse, it was up to 8.7.  You think that and I know you were in the hospital for something else; you had another bout of pancreatitis, right.

PATIENT L538
Uh yeah.  So they probably improved and then got worse.  If I got a blood test today, it  would be bad.

DOCTOR L538
Probably be better.

PATIENT L538
It would be bad.

DOCTOR L538
Well why don't we just recheck it in a couple of months.

PATIENT L538
Okay.

DOCTOR L538
And keep doing what we're doing uh you've been through a lot so it may have messed with the sugars.  Um. 

PATIENT L538
I don’t know if it's related to the radiation or anything?  But I notice some tingling in my left @@@.

DOCTOR L538
Okay uh it's tingling?

PATIENT L538
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L538
How often does it happen?

PATIENT L538
Um, uh several times a day.

DOCTOR L538
Okay.

PATIENT L538
Yeah I don't know if it's related to the radiation or what.

DOCTOR L538
Hmm.  Any chest pain?

PATIENT L538
No.

DOCTOR L538
Does it happen if you use it more or?

PATIENT L538
No it just comes and goes and I just noticed it started when I started the radiation.

DOCTOR L538
Okay.  Yeah it could potentially be related to the radiation, it's hard to say.  Uh do you feel weakness in your arm?

PATIENT L538
No.  Just strange, just this strange tingling feeling.

DOCTOR L538
Yeah.  Alright.

PATIENT L538
I also mentioned to the radiation doctor @@@.

DOCTOR L538
Yeah.

PATIENT L538
Oh one other thing doctor, I @@@.

DOCTOR L538
Okay.

PATIENT L538
And uh I need for you to order the patches.

DOCTOR L538
Oh okay yeah.

PATIENT L538
And uh some of those nicotine lozenges that you take with the patches sometime.  They told me I have to stop smoking.  

DOCTOR L538
Yeah.

PATIENT L538
I definitely have to do that.

DOCTOR L538
You can't use uh; you cannot smoke with uh this stuff either.

PATIENT L538
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L538
Uh.  Do you want to pick it up today or?

PATIENT L538
Yes I would appreciate it if I could.

DOCTOR L538
Do you want the gum?  I think we have the gum.

PATIENT L538
Uh okay, okay.

DOCTOR L538
Uh and @@@ lozenges.  So you take, you know you take them predominantly when you have uh cravings.  

PATIENT L538
It must have been a long morning for you.

DOCTOR L538
Well it's not too bad.  Alright your blood pressure's been good.  I want to bring you back in a few months and then we'll repeat everything okay.

PATIENT L538
Okay, good enough.

DOCTOR L538
You need to get labs drawn beforehand.

PATIENT L538
Okay.  I can do that in a couple of days.

DOCTOR L538
Yeah I mean it's up to you.  If you're here you can do it and otherwise you can do it the day of and you know I don't want to make you come in just for that um.  Don't worry about it, just uh.

PATIENT L538
Alright.  @@@.

DOCTOR L538
Yeah, exactly.  Alright uh so let me talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back.

PATIENT L538
