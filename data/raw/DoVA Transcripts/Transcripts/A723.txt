PATIENT H482
I thought they did.

DOCTOR A723
Oh eyeglasses, so you've seen the eye doctors?

PATIENT A723
That was last year or.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah, so you're a patient of them.  If I was you I'd go down there because once you're a patient you have to call and make an appointment.

PATIENT A723
Yeah.

DOCTOR A723
So go down there, make an appointment, tell them my eyes have been bothering me.

PATIENT A723
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A723
And then they should give you a sooner than later appointment.

DOCTOR A723
Okay.  Have you ever gotten shingles before?

PATIENT A723
No.

Have you ever gotten the shingles vaccination?

PATIENT A723
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR A723
Have you refused it?

PATIENT A723
No, what it is?  What does it do?

DOCTOR A723
Well it's like chicken pox that old people get.

PATIENT H482
Yeah.

DOCTOR A723
And usually.

PATIENT A723
If they gave it to me I don't know.  They give me all kinds of shots.

DOCTOR A723
No it doesn't look like they gave it to you.

PATIENT A723
Yeah.

DOCTOR A723
Immunizations, nope.  So if you had chicken pox when you were a kid you can get chicken pox but it comes back like painful.

PATIENT A723
Okay.

DOCTOR A723
You know like you get a rash, you can get it anywhere in your body.

PATIENT H482
I don't even know if I had chicken pox.

DOCTOR A723
Oh you don't?

PATIENT A723
I know I had all my shots when I was growing up.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah but no one got chicken pox shots until my generation.

PATIENT A723
And then oh I might have when I went to the service though.

DOCTOR A723
No they.

PATIENT A723
They wouldn't give that @@@.

DOCTOR A723
They don't give it to you in the service yeah.

PATIENT H482
You’re on your own? Get a rash on your ass – it’s too bad.

DOCTOR A723
Um.

PATIENT A723

DOCTOR A723
But didn't they, so you ordered, he ordered antibiotic eye drops.

PATIENT A723
No.

DOCTOR A723
And you never got them.

PATIENT A723
He gave me antibiotic pills.

DOCTOR A723
For seven days?

PATIENT A723
Right.

DOCTOR A723
But he didn't give you the eye drops at all.

PATIENT H482
I never got the eye drops.

DOCTOR A723
Let me see.  Did he even order it?  Take seven days, oh he never ordered the eye drops actually.

PATIENT A723
Okay that might explain it.

DOCTOR A723
He just gave you oral antibiotics.  Did he say he wanted you to get the eye drops that were antibiotics?

PATIENT A723
He said he was gonna do that and then to put the warm compresses on my eyes and all that.

DOCTOR A723
Has that been helping?

PATIENT A723
Hmm yeah I guess.  But still my eyes are still burning and stuff.

DOCTOR A723

PATIENT H482
That's the one I got right now, the new one.

DOCTOR A723
Alright.

PATIENT A723
But that, the lisinopril.  I stopped taking one of them.

DOCTOR A723
Why?

PATIENT A723
Cause they told me to.

DOCTOR A723
Who told you that?

PATIENT A723
You guys did.

DOCTOR A723
Let me see.

PATIENT H482
Should be on there.

DOCTOR A723
Let me see.

PATIENT A723
Cause they wanted to know why was I taking two, two blood pressure pills or something like that.

DOCTOR A723
Well no people can take two, three, four.

PATIENT A723
They told me no I shouldn't be taking them so they took them off.  I don't know if it was lisinopril or listopril or something like that.

DOCTOR A723
Let's see.  Pressure is not well controlled, so blood pressure was high.  Had to stop hydrochlorothiazide due to elevated creatinine.  So we stopped your hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT A723
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A723
So we didn't stop the lisinopril but we stopped the hydrochlorothiazide.  Let me see if anybody else stopped it.  The Dietary didn't do anything.

PATIENT H482
It would be the diabetic doctors.

DOCTOR A723
Diabetes, previous Lantus, normotensive, on the ACE inhibitors which is lisinopril.  He didn't say to stop it.

PATIENT A723
Well somebody told me cause I know, cause I didn't even get it in the mail.  I know one of them I didn't get it no more.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT A723
That's the only one okay.

DOCTOR A723
That's the one I stopped.  Let's see what the ER doctor did.

PATIENT A723
So what's the other name of it then, the hydro whatever.

DOCTOR A723
Hydrochlorothiazide, HCTZ.

PATIENT H482
What's that?

DOCTOR A723
Hydrochlorothiazide.  It's not on there cause I took it off.

PATIENT A723
But it's on here, oh no it's not.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah.

PATIENT A723
And then that's the one I don't take.  I know you guys took one off for me and I say okay.

DOCTOR A723
It wasn't the lisinopril then.

PATIENT A723
No.

DOCTOR A723
Okay.

PATIENT H482
Uh maybe they call it listopril?

DOCTOR A723
No, no, no, lisinopril.

PATIENT A723
Okay.

DOCTOR A723
Okay.  I knew no one else would have told you that.

PATIENT A723
Yeah I got the lid scrub.  One check, no more refills.

DOCTOR A723
Are you drinking water?

PATIENT A723
A lot of water.  Peeing every five minutes man.  Why is my water down?

DOCTOR A723
No your creatinine is still high.

PATIENT H482
What's that?

DOCTOR A723
That's for your kidneys.  And we already took and you weren't taking the hydrochlorothiazide anymore?

PATIENT A723
No.

DOCTOR A723
Cause you don't have any @@@ huh?

PATIENT A723
Nope.

DOCTOR A723

DOCTOR A723
But does she know which medicines you take other than @@@.

PATIENT H482
She should know.  She's the one that saves me all the time.

DOCTOR A723
Here we go.

PATIENT A723
So all of this is in there right?

DOCTOR A723
Huh?

PATIENT A723
All this is in there?

DOCTOR A723
Yeah.  But it's one thing to give you the medication and it’s one thing if you still had it at home and you've been taking it.  So you don't know which ones you're taking?

PATIENT A723
Not really.  I just take them cause there's a ton in the morning and a ton in the evening.

DOCTOR A723
Well your sugar is getting better.

PATIENT H482
Yeah just that when it drops, my reaction is eat a candy or something.

DOCTOR A723

PATIENT A723
Instead of, but then when I overeat it goes up, if it's regular food it doesn't matter.  The sugar's gonna go up.

DOCTOR A723

DOCTOR A723
Okay let's see.  Okay it was, they said they couldn't do it.  This was in December.  They said it wasn't a good sample.

PATIENT A723
Right so they told me to send another one.

DOCTOR A723
Did you send another one?

PATIENT A723
Yeah cause they gave me a paper to come out here and get it.  Somebody gave me the card with that.  He said it wouldn't work so I had to do it again.

DOCTOR A723
There's all these labs I wanted you to get and you didn't get them.

PATIENT H482
What's that?

DOCTOR A723
Back in May. Why didn’t they draw any of these today? Anyway let's see, creatinine, phosphorus, there's no stool order.  Alright I'll have to do another one.  Since you don't want to get the colonoscopy right?

PATIENT A723
Do this?

DOCTOR A723
Yeah I'll put it in.

PATIENT A723
Another one?

DOCTOR A723
Yeah it wasn't in there.

PATIENT A723
Hmm.

DOCTOR A723
Look I'm putting it in in the lab right.

PATIENT H482

DOCTOR A723
But this was the second time they took it, it was 117?

PATIENT A723
The first time was 147.

DOCTOR A723
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A723
They said the second one was real good, whatever.  

DOCTOR A723
Now I'll order the, the eye drops are already ordered so it's not like I could do anything.  I would call the Pharmacy and make sure they give you another one.

PATIENT A723
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A723
And just let them know that you never got the one before that.

PATIENT H482
Yeah, it's weird that I didn't.  I got the, like I said I got the eye scrub but never got the drops cause they were supposed to come at the same time.

DOCTOR A723
Okay.  Call them you can renew it.

PATIENT A723
Yeah.

DOCTOR A723
It's there.  All you have to do is just call and have them send it to you okay.

PATIENT A723
Sounds like a plan.

DOCTOR A723
Alright so what are you gonna do?  You're gonna see the eye doctor right?

PATIENT A723
Yeah I guess I'll go down there and make an appointment.

DOCTOR A723
Go and make an appointment, call to get your eye drops cause it’s in there.  All you have to do is just call it.  So eye doctor, eye drops, do the stool cards and whenever you're able to come back you can just turn it in cause the lab is in there and what else? Anything else going on?

PATIENT H482

PATIENT A723
Right in here.

DOCTOR A723

DOCTOR A723
Do you sleep on your back or on your side or face down?

PATIENT H482
On my side.

DOCTOR A723
On your side.  Alright.  Have you tried sleeping with your face up?

PATIENT A723

PATIENT A723
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A723

PATIENT A723
But I could still do it, yes that hurt.  But they sent me to therapy for this but it still.  It was okay and now it's starting to hurt again.

DOCTOR A723
Is it the same pain?

PATIENT H482
Yeah back here and over here.

DOCTOR A723
It was the same pain before?

PATIENT A723
Yeah.

DOCTOR A723
It was the same pain.

PATIENT A723
And then my leg hurt down here.

DOCTOR A723
Let's see, Occupational Therapy.

PATIENT A723
And it worked, she did it once and I don't know what was wrong but she got it straightened out quick.  I think her name was NAME the therapist.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah NAME.

PATIENT H482
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A723
Have you continued doing the therapy at home?

PATIENT A723
Yeah.  Well I do until it starts hurting then I stop.

DOCTOR A723
I think you need to start.

PATIENT A723
Same thing with walking.  I try to walk.

DOCTOR A723
This was just in June.

PATIENT A723
Right I try to walk and everything starts hurting again.  I'm hoping my legs.

DOCTOR A723
Are you doing, did you do the stretching today?

PATIENT H482
No.

DOCTOR A723
Did you do it in the last week?

PATIENT A723
Yeah.  I went, well I was gonna go Sunday but I couldn't because our basement was flooded in my house.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah.

PATIENT A723
Where I live so I had to go upstairs and we had a plumber.

DOCTOR A723
Were you doing stuff, moving around?

PATIENT A723
No.  They don't let me do anything.

DOCTOR A723
Okay.

PATIENT H482
Cause they got a treadmill so I get on that treadmill and I walk on the treadmill.

DOCTOR A723
And you started getting pain in your arm?

PATIENT A723
Mostly my legs.  My neck I don't know why it just started out of the blue it started hurting.  It's been like that for a couple weeks now.

DOCTOR A723
Have you taken a Tylenol or anything?

PATIENT A723
No cause I take the aspirin in the morning with my pills.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah but the aspirin is more for your diabetes.

PATIENT A723
Right.

DOCTOR A723
And then you should take a Tylenol.

PATIENT H482
Take a regular Tylenol?

DOCTOR A723
Yeah like 600 or 650, whatever the dose is.

PATIENT A723
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A723
I think they sell them 325, just take two of those.

PATIENT A723
Yeah.

DOCTOR A723
And then see how you do when you're walking but I think you need to start stretching every day just like the physical therapist and if it doesn't help then you can call and let the nurse know that you want therapy or call the therapist.  Can you set up an appointment with the therapist?

PATIENT A723
I guess I could yeah.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah.

PATIENT H482
I got her thing at home.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah.  You could call her and ask her if she says that I have to order it again then call the nurse and let them know.

PATIENT A723
Well actually you didn't order it, it was the doctor DOCTOR.

DOCTOR A723
Oh the endocrinologist.

PATIENT A723
Right she's the one that ordered it.

DOCTOR A723
And then you felt better?

PATIENT A723
Yeah right away.  She was massaging and doing all kinds of crazy stuff and then right away it started working.

DOCTOR A723
But you've got to stretch every day then.

PATIENT H482
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A723
Okay.  I think you've got to do everything they told you to do in therapy every day though.

PATIENT A723
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A723
Okay and if it doesn't work then we might have to enroll you again for physical therapy. Alright so you're gonna stretch right?

PATIENT A723
Well yeah.

DOCTOR A723
And then try to take some Tylenol.

PATIENT A723
Right.

DOCTOR A723
And then if it doesn't work then you have to see therapy again.

PATIENT H482
Because I mean I'm walking even though it's killing me.  Like in my arm and my legs too, this leg.  And I walk cause they said you have to walk.  I says okay but shit I go a little bit then everything starts hurting.  And it's all on this side all the time the right side.

DOCTOR A723
Oh because you have peripheral vascular disease too.

PATIENT A723
Right.  What is that?  I got all kinds of good stuff.

DOCTOR A723
Did you get the CT run-off at all or no?

PATIENT A723
What's that?

DOCTOR A723
Because it looks like DOCTOR wanted you to have a run-off.

PATIENT A723
A run-off?

DOCTOR A723
Yeah basically a CT scan to look at your arteries.  They didn't do it right?

PATIENT H482
No.  They said because of the kidneys I wasn't drinking enough water or whatever.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah.

PATIENT A723
But I think I did it at Rush.

DOCTOR A723
They did the run-off?

PATIENT A723
Because they.

DOCTOR A723
Back in January of when did you go to Rush?

PATIENT A723
In March or whenever it was.

DOCTOR A723
March 26th.

PATIENT H482
Because they did a procedure on me.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah.  They did the run-off because.

PATIENT A723
And then they.

DOCTOR A723
When did you go to Rush?

PATIENT A723
What it's not in there and this is all the paper shit I got to fill out for.

DOCTOR A723
No they did, they didn't put in another stent right?

PATIENT A723
No they just.

DOCTOR A723
They said you had mild, you didn't have like significant?

PATIENT H482
No they said, no in January or December they want me to go back and they want to check all my neck veins and everything.

DOCTOR A723
Well I could check them here.  What’s cheaper for you, there or here?

PATIENT A723
I'd go with Medicare.

DOCTOR A723
Okay and they'll take care of the rest?

PATIENT A723
Yeah, Medicaid or whatever.

DOCTOR A723
Yes.

PATIENT A723
I could go to either one.  I can go here but they didn't want to do it last time so when I went to Rush and I told them that it was bothering me they just did it on this side first time and then when they put the stents they did it in my leg.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah.

PATIENT H482
On this side.

DOCTOR A723
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A723
Then when they put it on this side they what do you call that, whatever they do.

DOCTOR A723
You had a catheterization.

PATIENT A723
Right they did that again and they go it looks okay but we got to wait and see cause we're not sure.  I tell them whatever but this leg keeps hurting right along with my arm and everything.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah.

PATIENT A723
And then the stupid neck pain and my headaches and I've never had headaches, only when I had hangovers but I don't drink no more.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah.  Well I can order the carotid Dopplers.  It might take a few days or maybe a week.  It's up to you if you want me to go ahead and order it.

PATIENT H482
Yeah I can come over here.

DOCTOR A723
What's closer to your house?

PATIENT A723
Here.

DOCTOR A723
Here.

PATIENT A723
I live right down on Burlington, right off of Ogden.  Yeah I mean I could do that.  He said, he mentioned something that I might have to get another stent in my leg or something but I told him whatever you are the doctors I don't know.  I already got three.  And besides DOCTOR the guy who wrote to you, he's retired.

DOCTOR A723
Hmm.

PATIENT A723
So my cardiologist, so I don't know.  And the one that did the surgery on me is there so that's a procedure it's not a surgery.  He's still there but.

DOCTOR A723
Yeah @@@.  Let me listen to your neck.  And they've never done surgery right?

PATIENT H482
No.

DOCTOR A723
On your neck.

PATIENT A723
No just on the back.  They did my back surgery but that was like a million years.  They did surgery on L5.

DOCTOR A723

PATIENT A723

DOCTOR A723
Yeah I don't know if they'll take them off actually.

PATIENT H482
They said they would laser them or something.  I don't care I mean unless they got that tree oil stuff or whatever it's called.

DOCTOR A723
No, they usually just to cut them off @@@.

PATIENT A723
Oh really?

DOCTOR A723
Yeah they just cut.

PATIENT A723
Whatever.  If they do it then, let's do the important things first.

DOCTOR A723
Okay you don't have to do that cause I'm ordering a lot already.

PATIENT A723
Yeah.

DOCTOR A723
So the carotid Dopplers um, vascular studies.

PATIENT H482
