DOCTOR B008
PATIENT.  Hi.

PATIENT B008
@@@.  How you doing?

DOCTOR B008
I heard you were in the hospital.

PATIENT B008
Yeah.

DOCTOR B008
How you doing?

PATIENT B008
Well the first thing I need to do is @@@ last time.

DOCTOR B008
Is that when you went to the hospital?

PATIENT B008
No I was in the hospital because I had chronic hepatitis and my @@@ was up.

DOCTOR B008
How you doing now?

PATIENT B008
Well I feel I'm just doing a little better.  Every now and then I have feels like I got to throw up but it eased.

DOCTOR B008
I'm trying to find the last notes.  How long were in the hospital for this time?

PATIENT B008
About a week.
  
DOCTOR B008
Okay.  

PATIENT B008
One day short of a week.

DOCTOR B008
So you haven't been hospitalized in a while before this time.

PATIENT B008
Uh uh.

DOCTOR B008
@@@ what’s been going on, your ankle been bothering you?

PATIENT B008
My ankle, yeah, @@@ When they took @@@ it's kind of lightheaded @@@ and I had a lot of pain.  They tried to do that blockage for the nerves for it but it, it helped a little bit.  @@@ but it still hurts.
  
DOCTOR B008
Have you been to the Pain Clinic yet?

PATIENT B008
Yesterday.

DOCTOR B008
So it help out a little bit?

PATIENT B008
Yeah a little bit but you know now when I go, you know when I be going down steps or you sometimes when I lay down and try to get up I'd be in pain or sometimes when I sit down.  But if I'm moving around for a while you know it stops and you know it's kind of like whenever I'm up but whenever I lay down or sit down and have to get up then it gives me all kind of problems.  At nighttime I'll have to you know and when I get up and use the bathroom I have to constant deal with my pain.  I have to stand up before I bend down.  

DOCTOR B008
So just remind me, so they just took out the hardware right?

PATIENT B008
Yeah.
  
DOCTOR B008
So they took out some of the hardware.

PATIENT B008
Yeah.

DOCTOR B008
And they took out the hardware, when was it?

PATIENT B008
In February.

DOCTOR B008
February.  And then since February you've been having a lot of pain in your ankle?
  
PATIENT B008
Yeah.  Cause they said there's a separation in the bone where it broke.  It didn't heal properly because they took the metal out and they don't want to do another surgery.  So they're trying to get the pain management.  Pain Management said it might work and it might not work and you have to go through a series of close to five shots before it would really make a, you know, big difference. 

DOCTOR B008
So I think probably the best thing is to kind of let's see how it goes, because it’s your first time right?

PATIENT B008
Yeah.

DOCTOR B008
@@@ in your ankle?

PATIENT B008
No what they gave me for my back.
  
DOCTOR B008
For your back.  Are you still taking the pain meds at home?

PATIENT B008
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR B008
What are you taking right now?

PATIENT B008
Morphine which don't really work that much.  Because I been on it for so long that I've built up a tolerance for it.

DOCTOR B008
Alright.

PATIENT B008
But I still have the pain and I took @@@.  You know they tried raising it, they give prescriptions now but sometime when I take them it don't even seem like it do no good cause it still has an ache and I have a stabbing pain and sometimes it feels like it's burning.  They gave me some @@@ but @@@.
  
DOCTOR B008
Okay.

PATIENT B008
Yeah so.

DOCTOR B008
And you've got diabetes right?

PATIENT B008
Yes.

DOCTOR B008
Have you been checking your sugars at home?

PATIENT B008
Yeah my sugars been running a bit high.
  
DOCTOR B008
Which numbers?

PATIENT B008
Uh like 275, 188, it's always over the 150.  I forgot to bring my meter cause the meter holds the readings.

DOCTOR B008
Yeah.

PATIENT B008
But I forgot to bring it with me.

DOCTOR B008
So I have you taking 100 units of Glargine @@@lantis?

PATIENT B008
No.
  
DOCTOR B008
No 14 units.

PATIENT B008
14.

DOCTOR B008
Okay and you're also taking the regular, the Novolin? 

PATIENT B008
Regular at night, well I take regular three times a day almost you know, whenever it's over the 150 and uh I take the other one and that's what I take every nighttime.

DOCTOR B008
We're gonna have to go up because your sugars, I'm looking back, have been too high.  How's your diet been?

PATIENT B008
Well my diet's been pretty where I like, you know every now and then you know I have maybe I don't have a desire to eat but most of the time I take my medicine in the morning @@@ I try to you know eat something so you know I have something to work with it.  Yeah.
  
DOCTOR B008
Are you taking the regular insulin three times a day?

PATIENT B008
Yeah.

DOCTOR B008
With the sliding scale.

PATIENT B008
Yes and anytime it goes over 150.  But you know I @@@ gain any weight because now I'm 218 instead of @@@ and I was down, at first I was in the 180s.

DOCTOR B008
Okay.

PATIENT B008
And now I'm in the 200s because you know what insulin do for me is I take it on a regular basis, it uh raises the appetite so at nighttime they give us snacks cause I'm in a transition house.
  
DOCTOR B008
Okay.

PATIENT B008
And sometime I find myself eating cookies and candy and stuff all through the night, potato chips and stuff.

DOCTOR B008
Well that's going to definitely screw up your diabetes, what you got to do is, and this is serious, I mean now @@@ we can’t keep going up on your insulin forever but try to eat um, if there's candy eat an apple or fruits, okay.

PATIENT B008
Yeah.

DOCTOR B008
Different things. All those treats, uh, @@@.  So you're not drinking anything are you?

PATIENT B008
No.  I haven't drunk since @@@.  I had one drink last August.
  
DOCTOR B008
And you're taking the gabapentin?

PATIENT B008
Yeah I be taking that every day three times a day but sometimes uh when I take all that medication you know I got a lot of things I have to do through the day and stuff so it makes me tired and sluggish but you know I go to custodian class Monday, Thursday and Friday and every day I go to ATP @@@ you know but I been having problems @@@ ATP.  I went through a lot of @@@ this week.

DOCTOR B008
@@@.

PATIENT B008
That's uh for drug and alcohol.

DOCTOR B008
Okay.

PATIENT B008
That's where they @@@ training the class.
  
DOCTOR B008
Okay.

PATIENT B008
For recovery and.

DOCTOR B008
Okay.  Have you been having any chest pain or anything like that?

PATIENT B008
No.  But I been having a lot of frequent urination at nighttime.  Sometime I'm going to get up five, six times a night.  It's just like every time I lay down really again, you know like I say my leg, it's real bad when I have to get up and go to the bathroom cause it's real painful.

DOCTOR B008
Have you been thirsty a lot during the day?

PATIENT B008
No I cut back.  I really don't drink that much pop anymore.  I don't drink unless it’s dinnertime and usually for a while you know pretty much I was real bloated.  You know my stomach went out to here, it was real puffy, you know up to.
  
DOCTOR B008
Did you ever try the, I think the urinating a lot is probably from your sugars being so high okay.

PATIENT B008
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B008
So we got to try to get these under control and I think we're probably going to help you out with you peeing so much, cause that's a lot.  So that’s a lot of peeing in a day.

PATIENT B008
Hmm.  And it's at all times at night.  You know during the day, you see I have more urination in the nighttime than I do in the day.  You know @@@ four, five, six times a night you know.  When I'm in the Transition House and there's six men to the room.

DOCTOR B008
Right.

PATIENT B008
They say man, you know they be whining, I say well it's probably all these medications, I know it could be my sugars too.
  
DOCTOR B008
Yeah it's probably your sugars more than anything else.

PATIENT B008
And then at night, @@@ long time that I don't have to go, you know @@@.  Last night was the first time.

DOCTOR B008
So um you just turned 50 right?

PATIENT B008
Yeah.

DOCTOR B008
So you know what happens when you turn 50?

PATIENT B008
Yeah.
  
DOCTOR B008
It's time to get a colonoscopy okay.  Do you know what that is?

PATIENT B008
That uh, through your rectum?

DOCTOR B008
Yeah.  You ever have that done before?

PATIENT B008
Yeah.

DOCTOR B008
Okay.  So when was the last time you had one?

PATIENT B008
It's been a while back.
  
DOCTOR B008
More than 10 years ago?

PATIENT B008
I don't remember, I don't think so.

DOCTOR B008
Okay.  Do you take an aspirin?

PATIENT B008
Yeah I still take the one aspirin that they give me.  You know they give me uh it's a real high potency aspirin but its real tiny like baby aspirin.

DOCTOR B008
Why did they do a colonoscopy in the past?

PATIENT B008
Well I think it, I don't think I had one, I don't think I had one I'm not sure.
  
DOCTOR B008
No? Okay.  Do you smoke?

PATIENT B008
Yeah maybe less than, about maybe during the daytime I might smoke maybe five or six cigarettes.  So a lot of places I go, it's no smoking so you know I be going, like I say I be occupied most of the time and the places you go, like where I sleep we can't smoke, there's no smoking except during break time when you be outside and a little patio outside they got a patio and you smoke out there but you know most of the time I'm there you have groups and we always, they always put me, my time's always lots of time I don't smoke that much.

DOCTOR B008
Okay.  You're gonna have to @@@ paper @@@ and get your colonoscopy okay.  That way we can check for colon cancer.  Cause I think, let's see.  Then you're gonna see the eye doctor soon right?

PATIENT B008
Yes.  Now I haven't seen, I used to go to them uh every you know every month and @@@ Lakeside so um once @@@ Lakeside I stopped getting my @@@ and I was telling them I had a kind of like blurry vision sometime and uh that's when they put me in for you know @@@, that was the last time I was in the hospital.
