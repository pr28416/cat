DOCTOR O959
PATIENT.  All the way back to the left.

PATIENT O959
Okay.

DOCTOR O959
Okay, @@@ about really don't have to, I don't know about that okay.  How you feeling?

PATIENT O959
Fine. 

DOCTOR O959
@@@ weather. I feel like I haven’t seen the sun in years. How have your sugars been?

PATIENT O959
High.

DOCTOR O959
Okay how high is high.

PATIENT O959
372, 360.

DOCTOR O959
Okay.

PATIENT O959
I'm at 50 cc a night plus the uh.

DOCTOR O959
Plus the metformin.

PATIENT O959
Metformin right.

DOCTOR O959
Okay.  Plus the Glargine.

PATIENT O959
Yes.

DOCTOR O959
The Glargine is 50, the glyburide is 10.

PATIENT O959
Right.

DOCTOR O959
And you take that and the glyburide twice a day.

PATIENT O959
Right.

DOCTOR O959
The metformin.

PATIENT O959
Twice a day.

DOCTOR O959
Okay.  I looked at your, your triglycerides have come down a little bit by 200 points.

PATIENT O959
Okay.

DOCTOR O959
So we're going in the right direction but that's another thing that I want to tackle and I'm debating on how to do that since you're on gemfibrozil you're kind of maxed out on that.  Are you taking um fish oil?

PATIENT O959
No.  I'm allergic to fish, 

DOCTOR O959
You’re allergic to fish. So that's a no go okay.  So the blood pressure was good.

PATIENT O959
Yeah I don't have any refills on my medications.

DOCTOR O959
I will make sure everything is refilled.  Actually let me do that right now.  Let's go through it together.  Glyburide you have two refills.  

PATIENT O959
Alright.

DOCTOR O959
I want you to continue that so let me just make sure you have enough okay.  Let's do, actually let's wait when I come back to see if we need to make any changes to anything.  Um you're at 50.  I'm just thinking that we're gonna have to go up on the Glargine.  Um are your sugars 300 consistently throughout the entire day?

PATIENT O959
Yeah.

DOCTOR O959
Okay.  What are they right before you go to bed at night?

PATIENT O959
Um if I'm good it gets down to about 278.

DOCTOR O959
278.  What are they in the morning when you wake up?

PATIENT O959
Around 300.

DOCTOR O959
Still in the 300s okay and you're taking, you're taking the Glargine.

PATIENT O959
Yes.

DOCTOR O959
You're taking three of the metformin tabs.

PATIENT O959
Metformin?

DOCTOR O959
Yeah metformin.

PATIENT O959
I take two, two tablets.

DOCTOR O959
You take two of the 500.

PATIENT O959
One in the morning and one at night.

DOCTOR O959
In the morning okay.  So that's okay so that's one thing we should do um, the order here is for you to take three so let's start taking three.

PATIENT O959
Okay.

DOCTOR O959
So morning, noon and at night.

PATIENT O959
Yeah, okay.

DOCTOR O959
Okay.  You were only taking it twice a day.  There are too main things, the triglycerides and the diabetes.  Would you agree with that?

PATIENT O959
Right.

DOCTOR O959
Anything else going on?  Okay.

PATIENT O959
This tooth I got and the dentist is watching that now.

DOCTOR O959
Okay good cause I know I don't do teeth, I know nothing about teeth.  Okay um how's the rash?  It looks better.

PATIENT O959
It looks better but I ran out of the lotion, they just refilled me so.

DOCTOR O959
Okay perfect um.

PATIENT O959
I saw Dermatology on the 11th.

DOCTOR O959
Good, good, I'm glad that that's helping.  Um and we can even do metformin, we can even do it four times a day but that's kind of like maxing it out so most people recommend for type 2 diabetes to max out the metformin so to have it 2000 mg a day so that would be you know two in the morning and two at night.

PATIENT O959
Okay.

DOCTOR O959
Something like that.  Since your sugars are so high um I mean that's, it's kind of what I want, I want to go up on that.  I know you should be at least taking three times a day.  Are you taking, are you checking your sugars after meals at all?

PATIENT O959
No.

DOCTOR O959
No.

PATIENT O959
Once in the morning and once at night I check it before I go to bed.  

DOCTOR O959
Okay and so both in the morning and both at bed they're about 300.

PATIENT O959
Right.

DOCTOR O959
Um and your last A1c was in June I think.

PATIENT O959
I just had blood taken today so.

DOCTOR O959
Today, is that, did I order.  I saw some of them came back already.  

PATIENT O959
Now uh.

DOCTOR O959
Was it just the triglycerides that I ordered today?

PATIENT O959
I don't know.

DOCTOR O959
Let me see.  I wonder.  There's a ton that I ordered um NAME, who is NAME.

PATIENT O959
It could be someone from special Clinic?

DOCTOR O959
Okay.  Okay.  Are you at home right now?

PATIENT O959
Yes.

DOCTOR O959
Living at home okay.  Okay, staying away from the drugs?

PATIENT O959
Oh I did cocaine Sunday but.

DOCTOR O959
Okay.

PATIENT O959
Just a little pinch.

DOCTOR O959
Again we got to keep you away from that, got to keep you away from that.  Alright.  So we got your triglycerides.

PATIENT O959
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O959
And we got your diabetes.  Um cocaine won't help either of those.

PATIENT O959
I know.

DOCTOR O959
Um so let me talk to DOCTOR, can I get you up here to just take a good listen to you?  Um I like that you're checking your sugars twice a day.

PATIENT O959
Right.

DOCTOR O959
That’s good. That way we can get a good assessment.  I might actually; I know you already got stuck once today um there's a couple other I might, at least draw @@@.  We did not, oh yeah they did.  Oh yeah he did.  I wonder if that was drawn today.

PATIENT O959
That was drawn today.

DOCTOR O959
The hemoglobin A1c, do you know?

PATIENT O959
That's what they were checking for the fast issue.

DOCTOR O959
Yeah they did the fast.

PATIENT O959
Diabetic.

DOCTOR O959
Yeah and the diabetic one.

PATIENT O959
Yes they done it, okay.

DOCTOR O959
Okay.  I'll have to just look for those then.  Okay.  Just breathe normally.

PATIENT O959
I'm doing whatever, you know the oxygen, no not oxygen but you know the breathing machine.

DOCTOR O959
Oh for the sleep apnea.  Remember oh yes I remember that so does that make you feel a little bit better throughout the day?

PATIENT O959
Oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR O959
100% huh.  It's like night and day isn't it?

PATIENT O959
Yes.

DOCTOR O959
Yeah.

PATIENT O959
I'm getting rest at night now so.

DOCTOR O959
Yeah it makes you feel a lot better.  Oh my God it makes you feel a lot better.  I'm glad um, I thank you for reminding me of that, I forgot about that.  Um so we solved one of your problems.

PATIENT O959
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O959
I think we're getting close on the triglycerides.  We got to get those down because like I said they, when they're at such high levels with the diabetes you have an increased risk of heart disease.

PATIENT O959
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O959
So we have to control the diabetes better and we have to control the triglycerides better.  Let me look at some of the medications that we can go up on.  The metformin, I'm thinking that I want to go up to four a day but let me run that by DOCTOR.

PATIENT O959
Okay.

DOCTOR O959
Um.  I'm gonna see how high I can go.  Huh.  You're at the max for glyburide.  Allergic to fish okay.  Yeah cause you went from 1155 for the triglycerides.

PATIENT O959
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O959
To 765 and now we're at 537.

PATIENT O959
It's going down.  You want to get me down to below 4 right?

DOCTOR O959
Yeah I'd like to get you below about 100.

PATIENT O959
Huh.

DOCTOR O959
Have you ever tried a medicine called niacin?

PATIENT O959
No.

DOCTOR O959
I saw that you were on it in the past.

PATIENT O959
What is niacin for?

DOCTOR O959
It was the lipids, the fat in the blood.

PATIENT O959
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O959
Um.  Blood pressure was good today.  Alright, let me see I think.  Let me talk to DOCTOR.  I think I want to go up on the metformin and we'll see what she says.

PATIENT O959
Okay.

DOCTOR O959
Um and I'd like to see if, see what the dose for niacin is and I'd like to try niacin and maybe increasing your simvastatin.  We're getting there slowly.

PATIENT O959
Yeah.

DOCTOR O959
So we're going up slowly and things are coming down so we're going in the right direction.

PATIENT O959
Okay.

DOCTOR O959
So it might take another month or two but I think we're gonna get there okay.

PATIENT O959
Alright.

DOCTOR O959
Along with diet.  Diet's going to be a main thing too you know, fruits and vegetables and stay away from the fatty foods so.  Let me go talk to her real quick.

PATIENT O959
Okay.

DOCTOR O959
And I'll be back okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  32:00  DOCTOR IN:  38:21)

DOCTOR O959
Okay.  DOCTOR said it was a good idea um.  Um so the metformin.

PATIENT O959

PATIENT O959
At noon.

DOCTOR O959
Morning, noon and night.

PATIENT O959
Okay.

DOCTOR O959
And then we're also gonna increase your Glargine so that's okay we'll get the orders here, medications.  Um so keep taking the glyburide and you take that's two of them twice a day.

PATIENT O959

DOCTOR O959
Okay um you take the Glargine so we're gonna change that.  You're at 50 right now, let's go to 60.

PATIENT O959
Okay.

DOCTOR O959
Um and if for some reason they don't approve then I'll have to kind of fight with them to get it approved.
