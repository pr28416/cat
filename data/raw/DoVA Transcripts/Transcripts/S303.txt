DOCTOR S303
Hi PATIENT, how you doing?

PATIENT S303
Okay and you?

DOCTOR S303
We haven't seen you in a while.

PATIENT S303
No you haven't.

DOCTOR S303
I wonder how long it's been since we've seen you um oh January.  Of ‘09, has it really been that long?

PATIENT S303
(Laughter)

DOCTOR S303
No May 30th, yeah.

PATIENT S303
I was gonna say, I thinking it was a little sooner than that.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah that was since you saw me, @@@.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
@@@.

PATIENT S303
Oh that's what happened, you had a baby.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah the middle of May.

PATIENT S303
Oh I bet you're glad to be back to work.

DOCTOR S303
Well, I've been back to work for a long time now.  Okay, so let's take a look.  I saw you in May.

PATIENT S303
Girl or boy?

DOCTOR S303
Girl.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
Alright uh we talked about some.

PATIENT S303
Congratulations.

DOCTOR S303
Thank you.

PATIENT S303
@@@.

DOCTOR S303
But that's been a while @@@.  Um we were talking about some of these seizures.

PATIENT S303
Yes and they started to get a little worse actually.

DOCTOR S303
Alright so the problem with your seizures is that it looks like um let's see Neurology it looks like Neurology saw you since I last saw you.

PATIENT S303
Yes they have seen me.

DOCTOR S303
They're just saying you did an EEG they didn’t’ see @@@ but you tell me that you feel like you're having seizures.

PATIENT S303
I don't feel like I'm having seizures, I am having seizures.

DOCTOR S303
Neurology follow-up.  You saw you in February

PATIENT S303
Uh-huh.  If that burst of light that I'm seeing is called a seizure, then I'm having seizures.

DOCTOR S303
Okay.  So you're having these bursts of light.

PATIENT S303
Yeah.

DOCTOR S303
They increased the topiramate to 200 right?

PATIENT S303
Yeah.

DOCTOR S303
And then they sent you to the Eye Clinic, they did an MRI, imaging, MRI.

PATIENT S303
That burst of light is a seizure right?

DOCTOR S303
Uh you can also get those with headaches.  People can have headaches that will do that too.  Complex headaches could do that definitely.  So your MRI looks pretty normal.  Your MRI of your brain.

PATIENT S303
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S303
Looks essentially normal and the Eye Clinic saw you.

PATIENT S303
My MRI was normal?

DOCTOR S303
It's essentially normal yeah.  I mean it shows sinus congestion, some sinusitis in your sinuses but they didn't see anything uh in the vessels of your brain.  Now the test was only meant to look at the blood vessels in your brain.  That's what it was looking for and it said that your brain is getting sufficient blood in all the areas so that's good.  We don't want it to be abnormal.

PATIENT S303
No I don't anything to be abnormal.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah and then they sent you to the Eye Clinic but it doesn't look like you've seen them yet.

PATIENT S303
Yeah I seen the Eye Clinic.

DOCTOR S303
Like since they sent you in February?

PATIENT S303
Yeah I just came from the Eye Clinic.

DOCTOR S303
Right now?

PATIENT S303
No.

DOCTOR S303
Um.

PATIENT S303
I just.

DOCTOR S303
I'm just looking at the notes.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
Looks like the last time you saw an Eye Clinic was December @@, @@@@.

PATIENT S303
No I've been since then.

DOCTOR S303
You have, let me see, there's the Eye December 26th note, Optometry, February 25th, alright.

PATIENT S303
Right.

DOCTOR S303
Uh for Eye Clinic right, I just clicked this @@@ to get the results.

PATIENT S303
Right.  Well they didn't see anything that was abnormal.

DOCTOR S303
@@@, mild cataracts.

PATIENT S303
I have mild cataracts?

DOCTOR S303
Mild cataracts.

PATIENT S303
Oh great, that's all I need is to get a cataract.

DOCTOR S303
@@@.  They found the cataracts.  They found something but they didn't find the reason for why you have the flashing lights.

PATIENT S303
No.

DOCTOR S303
And they said you need to go back to Neurology @@@.  But you still been looking at, are you still having the flashing lights?

PATIENT S303
Yeah.

DOCTOR S303
How often?

PATIENT S303
I have them at least, even with the medication of going up 200.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
I still have them at least three or four times a day.

DOCTOR S303
Really?  Uh do you kind feel like you get confused at all when you have them?

PATIENT S303
I don't lose consciousness but it causes the confusion.

DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
And it causes me to, it blinds me.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.  With just one eye or both eyes?

PATIENT S303
Both eyes.  I lose complete sight.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
And I have total blackness.

DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
For at least three or four seconds after the burst of light.

DOCTOR S303
Hmm.

PATIENT S303
They took away my driver's license because of it.

DOCTOR S303
I'm not surprised.  @@@.

PATIENT S303
And now you're trying to tell me that nothing is wrong.

DOCTOR S303
Well I can tell you; all I can tell you is that the specialists have seen you about this issue.  Your neurologist and eye specialists haven't found, it doesn't mean you have nothing wrong we just haven't found that which is wrong yet okay.  Now there are things called complex headaches that can actually have flashing lights associated with them so with your neurologist is aware of that I would imagine @@@ going on.

PATIENT S303
Okay.  I'm telling you, this isn't headaches because there are times.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
When I shake so bad I can't even hold a glass of water in my hand.  But I see, I was sitting up at a restaurant.

DOCTOR S303
Is it one arm or one that's always happening, just any arm?

PATIENT S303
It's usually on the left side because I'm left-handed.

DOCTOR S303
Both arms?

PATIENT S303
I'll be sitting up in a restaurant eating.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
And people will be looking at me because I'm shaking like I'm an old drunk.  They think I'm old drunk.

DOCTOR S303
I see.

PATIENT S303
Because I shake like an old drunk.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.  Yeah I understand.

PATIENT S303
I'm having some type of neurologic.

DOCTOR S303
Neurologic problem.

PATIENT S303
It's something.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.  I wish I could tell you the answer but of all people, I'm not your neurologist.

PATIENT S303
I understand that.

DOCTOR S303
I know.  I understand it's really frustrating @@@ and you're not scheduled to see the neurologist again for a while are you?

PATIENT S303
No not yet.

DOCTOR S303
So they saw you in February and they wanted to see you, actually they wanted to see you this month.  They said come back in March of @@@@.

PATIENT S303
Okay.  I'll have to call and make an appointment.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah they want you to come so.

PATIENT S303
This is not in my head, trust me.

DOCTOR S303
I understand and I completely, I understand this is not something you're imagining.

PATIENT S303
Even with the increase in medications.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
The increase, I know the medication is helping.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
But it's not erasing the problem.

DOCTOR S303
I see.  Did you notice less of it after they increased the medication?

PATIENT S303
It's less because I was having about 20 of these a day.

DOCTOR S303
Oh I see.

PATIENT S303
So it helps.

DOCTOR S303
Right.

PATIENT S303
But it's not curing the problem right.

DOCTOR S303
Is that the only seizure medicine you're on?

PATIENT S303
That's the only seizure medication I'm on yes.

DOCTOR S303
So we may even need to put you on two seizure medicines.  Some people actually, you know statistically only 2/3 of the people who have seizures get controlled with one medicine.  You need, many people require two medicines to get control of their seizures and it's very, very common if people need more than one medicine.  So it's not you, it's not that the drug is bad it's that seizures are difficult to control with one medicine.

PATIENT S303
Okay.  As long as you understand that the medication has side effects on its own.

DOCTOR S303
Which side effects, all medicines do have side effects, which side effects are you….

PATIENT S303
One of them is the impotency.

DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
And you have like, I had weird sensations down my arms and legs, like a weird type of tingling sensation.

DOCTOR S303
Tingling sensation okay.  So that's on your left side?

PATIENT S303
Well I don't think it's just on my left side, it's on both sides but I've noticed it more on my left because I'm left-handed.  I use my left arm.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
And I use my left side more.  Especially since after the operation on my arm.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
My arm is a lot better.

DOCTOR S303
I see that's good, something's better.

PATIENT S303
Yeah.

DOCTOR S303
That's good.

PATIENT S303
Right that is good.  Because now I can actually use my arm again.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.  That's good then, also I'm just going through your last labs to make sure that we.

PATIENT S303
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S303
Have everything.  Now your cholesterol was still too high.

PATIENT S303
Cholesterol is still high yeah.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah.  You have, I saw you in May of 09 and last year it's still @@@.  Yeah this was @@@.  Oh we haven't actually repeated your cholesterol @@@.

PATIENT S303
I just had some type of test back in.

DOCTOR S303
Somebody in February.

PATIENT S303
Yeah.

DOCTOR S303
That could be your neurologist sent you for blood tests but they only checked like two blood, I mean they only literally checked two numbers.

PATIENT S303
Why?  Why didn't do the full thing?  Why did they do it?

DOCTOR S303
I don't think.  I don't know.  Usually it's better to just order everything just so you have to get it done.

PATIENT S303
Well why didn't they?

DOCTOR S303
I don't know.  They only ordered two tests which are useful but I need but the last time you had a full set of tests was 2008.

PATIENT S303
Yeah.  I mean if they're gonna do that, why only order two?

DOCTOR S303
Yeah I think, @@@ check something um, yeah I ordered labs on you in May.  I ordered a couple of things on you in May so the work @@@.  Okay.  Some of these are from 07.  Let me just check a couple of these things.  You've got orders in here from 2007, there you go.

PATIENT S303
@@@.

DOCTOR S303
And nobody's going to @@@ though I @@@ you have orders.

PATIENT S303
No, why there's no reason for all that.

DOCTOR S303
I agree.

PATIENT S303
I think that causes people to get confused when they look at all that.  All those @@@ and nobody cleans all that up and they @@@.

DOCTOR S303
I'll take care it.

PATIENT S303
Yeah, please do.

DOCTOR S303
@@@ there you go.  All cleaned.  So we'll just start from scratch okay.  We'll get fresh labs for this year, for you today.

PATIENT S303
Right.  You can't do it today because my ride is going to be here at 4:30.

DOCTOR S303
Okay.  So are coming back to the VA?  It looks like March 25th you've got something coming up

PATIENT S303
Yeah but that's from my, I have a weekly appointment here.

DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
And that's all that is.

DOCTOR S303
Well if you're physically gonna be here, we could draw the labs then.  If you're gonna be at the VA you could still have labs done that day.

PATIENT S303
Well, actually that's not a good time.  Actually on Thursday.  Can we do it on a different day?

DOCTOR S303
Well you could do it any day you want.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
Just remember to come in whenever you want.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
It could be any day you're gonna be here.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
@@@.  Um just any time before our next visit would be good.

PATIENT S303
When will my next visit be?

DOCTOR S303
Usually we want to see you every couple of months for your blood pressure and cholesterol and things like that.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
Depending on how well controlled.  Your blood pressure is looking real good today, 110/64.  Which is really good.

PATIENT S303
That's really surprising.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah.

PATIENT S303
Surprising.  I wasn't in such a good mood by the time they did that.

DOCTOR S303
Well your mood has is going to go @@@ nothing to do with your blood pressure.

PATIENT S303
I'm glad to hear that.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah.

PATIENT S303
I really am.

DOCTOR S303
And so your blood pressure's good and you're taking the prostate medicine with the prostate to help you pee easier.

PATIENT S303
Yes.

DOCTOR S303
And that actually also helps control the blood pressure too, that medicine so.

PATIENT S303
I'm glad to hear that.

DOCTOR S303
So @@@.

PATIENT S303
Because I don't need any of those right now but uh the one for, the sexual problem.

DOCTOR S303
Oh the Cialis.

PATIENT S303
Can I have a refill on that?

DOCTOR S303
Sure, you @@@.  And you should have ten refills on that one.

PATIENT S303
@@@ then why?

DOCTOR S303
@@@.

PATIENT S303
See, for a while they was coming automatically and then all of a sudden it just stopped.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah but they're supposed to be mailed.

PATIENT S303
Well nobody's mailed anything in the last two months so.

DOCTOR S303
So I just resent the prescription so they should @@@.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
It's um, it has refills on it.

PATIENT S303
That's why I don't understand why they stopped.

DOCTOR S303
I don't know.  So we have a lot of people who to the VA where it's coming and all of a sudden it stops.

PATIENT S303
It stopped.

DOCTOR S303
We don't know what happens.  Uh and it looks like.

PATIENT S303
And I made a refill for the, the seizure medication.

DOCTOR S303
Oh actually that's diclofenac, you have six refills on that.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
You can actually go to the Pharmacy and pick it up.

PATIENT S303
Well I can't today cause my ride's gonna be here in a little bit.

DOCTOR S303
So they haven't sent it to you?

PATIENT S303
Huh?

DOCTOR S303
They haven't sent it to you?

PATIENT S303
No.  That's what I'm saying, I just think it stopped.  I wanted Neurology to just.

DOCTOR S303
So I could put it in here, I mean whatever you need; I'll reenter it to make sure that this.

PATIENT S303
Yeah would you?

DOCTOR S303
That it @@@ back in but um, you have six refills on that one.

PATIENT S303
Yeah.  That's why I don't understand why they just stopped.

DOCTOR S303
I don't know.

PATIENT S303
Cause I know my refills were active.  I don't understand why it just stopped.

DOCTOR S303
Right.  I just don't know.  Um and it looks like you have colon cancer in the family.

PATIENT S303
Yeah.

DOCTOR S303
You got a colonoscopy two years ago.

PATIENT S303
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S303
And you were supposed to @@@.

PATIENT S303
As a matter of fact they just removed a polyp in November.

DOCTOR S303
They did go in and do an endoscopy?

PATIENT S303
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR S303
Um and when do they want to see you again?

PATIENT S303
Uh, I don't know.  Things got kind of messed up after that.

DOCTOR S303
Okay.  November uh.

PATIENT S303
I don't think there were any problems with it.  They said it was really, really small so.

DOCTOR S303
And then.

PATIENT S303
They didn't give me a date to come back though.

DOCTOR S303
Did they, after you had the procedure, did you see the stomach specialist afterwards?

PATIENT S303
No.

DOCTOR S303
Because when they did the procedure in November they wrote in their notes they wanted to see you in four weeks to review the results.

PATIENT S303
Okay and then they cancelled the appointment.

DOCTOR S303
They did, is that what happened?

PATIENT S303
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S303
Uh Gastroenterology consult and @@@.  So let's take a look at the results then uh @@@ checking the colon okay.  So they did a biopsy, looks like they found a little ulcer when they did the test, when they did the scope.  It looks like they found a little ulcer and then they did the biopsy of that and it looks like what it says, sometimes when people take a lot of nonsteroidal medicines like ibuprofen, Motrin, Naprosyn, things like that, it can damage the lining of their stomach.  Usually it happens in the stomach uh; however, I know sometimes maybe it can happen further down like in the colon and the rectum so the results of this says that there's a little ulcer, maybe it's related to somebody who takes a lot of these medicines but I don't think you do.  You don't take a lot of Motrin or ibuprofen.

PATIENT S303
Well I was then because of the uh, the shoulder.

DOCTOR S303
So you were.  So if you @@@ like there was a little ulcer, @@@ stomach ulcer.

PATIENT S303
Right.

DOCTOR S303
I personally never heard of anybody having ulcers in the colon from meds because they have similar linings but I don't see why not, it's probably very plausible.  Uh versus areas of poor blood flow and I don't see that happening.  So the important thing is that uh something that uh the stomach doctors initially wanted to see you in four weeks to discuss these results and this is @@@ explain to you @@@ for your health because I’ve never @@@ ulcers in the colon because @@@.  Uh so let's see if we can get you to see them for a follow-up okay.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
And see when, if they want to see you again, how often they want to follow you up regarding that.  Uh @@@.

PATIENT S303
Well what are you saying; I've got like an ulcer in my colon?

DOCTOR S303
Yeah they saw, sometimes people will have uh ulcers in their stomachs and sometimes they'll have ulcers in their colon.  I've never, uh I wasn't there when they were doing a colonoscopy and I don't know if it was a tiny piece of @@@ biopsies or if it was something bigger, so @@@ see the doctor who took care of it because I don’t want to give you false information @@@.  So I could tell you that what the report says it could be @@@.  So let's, uh it's not cancer.  Most importantly it's not cancer which is why we do the test and why you were checked because you had a family history of colon cancer.

PATIENT S303
Right.

DOCTOR S303
And so it's not cancer but to truly explain to you the results of it, I think the GI doctors should do that.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
Okay.  So @@@.  Okay so we'll send you to @@@.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

DOCTOR S303
And Neurology wanted to see you this month as well, let me put this in.

PATIENT S303
Right.

DOCTOR S303
Um and we can only do certain clinics.  We can't do all clinics here.

PATIENT S303
Right.

DOCTOR S303
Uh we can do many of them, but I don't think Neurology is in there, I don't think we can do the Neurology Clinic.

PATIENT S303
Right.

DOCTOR S303
Um and then let me check this note okay.  Okay, let's listen to your heart and lungs.  Can you take off your jacket and your shirt?

PATIENT S303
@@@.

DOCTOR S303
What do you mean?

PATIENT S303
@@@.

DOCTOR S303
@@@.

PATIENT S303
Well not with but you know, some of the people that I know, I @@@.

DOCTOR S303
Right, well let's find it, let's try to find it.

PATIENT S303
Hmm.

DOCTOR S303
Let's see, you don't need @@@.

PATIENT S303
Oh.

DOCTOR S303
I sent @@@.

PATIENT S303
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah.

PATIENT S303
@@@.

DOCTOR S303
Take some deep breaths for me.  One more, one more, one more.  Breathe normally.  Uh I can definitely here it, that's good.

PATIENT S303
Oh good.  Oh I know what else I need a refill on.

DOCTOR S303
Yes.

PATIENT S303
On my uh.

DOCTOR S303
Your inhalers?

PATIENT S303
Yes.

DOCTOR S303
Were you using the inhaler?

PATIENT S303
I need the one.

DOCTOR S303
What do you use them one for?

PATIENT S303
Uh bronchitis.

DOCTOR S303
Bronchitis.

PATIENT S303
I have the one with the orange top but I can't.

DOCTOR S303
Well it clearly wasn’t prescribed for a while because I don't see any recent prescriptions.

PATIENT S303
Now I just got one in January.

DOCTOR S303
Let me see @@@.  Okay.  I don’t see any refills on that.

PATIENT S303
They should be sending it to me automatically.

DOCTOR S303
Yeah.

PATIENT S303
They just stopped @@@.

DOCTOR S303
@@@.

PATIENT S303
I'll need the capsules too.

DOCTOR S303
The mometasone capsules?

PATIENT S303
Yeah.

DOCTOR S303
You have like 11 refills on that.

PATIENT S303
Well then why did they stop coming then?

DOCTOR S303
I don't know.  I can't tell you that.

PATIENT S303
Well I need those too.

DOCTOR S303
Okay.  I'll order it.  I'll be back in just a couple minutes okay.

PATIENT S303
Okay, thank you.

DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
I @@@, they just stopped coming.

DOCTOR S303
I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  146:30  DOCTOR IN:  155:00)

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Hello.

PATIENT S303
Oh right here.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT S303
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
You're taking medicine for your prostate?

FIRST DOCTOR S303
@@@.

PATIENT S303
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Yeah do you think that's working?

PATIENT S303
Yes it is working.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.  Were you on @@@ or was that the first month on this?

PATIENT S303
Well I was on a higher dose but then it worked like too well so we went back to the regular dose.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.  Were you ever on a lower dose @@@?

PATIENT S303
Well uh.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Did you take it and then it didn't work and had to take more?

PATIENT S303
No uh, this is uh 5 mg, I was on, they put me on 10 but it was like it worked too well.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
I see.

PATIENT S303
So they put me back on 5 again.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.  Tell me about the flashing lights you see.

PATIENT S303
Okay.  It's like; it's like a flash of a camera before your eyes.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Yeah.

PATIENT S303
It blinds me for about three or four seconds.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Do they move around or their?

PATIENT S303
What do you mean do they move around?

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Well do they move, does the light like moving or is it just like?

PATIENT S303
No it, you get an effect that goes from like from right to left but you, it flashes before your eyes that it blinds you.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
How long?

PATIENT S303
About three or four seconds.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
You say it goes white or it goes black?

PATIENT S303
It goes black.  Just like the flash, you get the aftermath like if you flash a camera before your eyes, like you get that flash.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh, sort of like if someone flashed a camera right in your face and you can't see.

PATIENT S303
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
@@@.

PATIENT S303
Right.  It lasts about three or four seconds and then it's over.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
So when you're actually seeing it, it will be black, not white.

PATIENT S303
No it's not white, it's black.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.  So you can't, so when you see there's just nothing.

PATIENT S303
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
It's nothing moving around?

PATIENT S303
No you see nothing.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
And then it comes back.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
And when does that happen?

PATIENT S303
It can happen at any time.  I can just be sitting up in bed watching TV or reading a book or anything.  It's not a specific thing that I'm doing.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Do you think this probably happens in the mornings?

PATIENT S303
Uh yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
When?

PATIENT S303
I can't give you a specific time as to when.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Last year, last month?

PATIENT S303
Uh probably about three or four months ago.  

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
It's happened before but it's gotten more regular before but I was taking medication and that brought it back to there.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh, so it's getting better with the medicines.

PATIENT S303
Yeah it is better with the medication.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.  So that prostate medicine, does that make it worse you think?

PATIENT S303
No.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Does it change anything.  When you started the @@@ were you having it?

PATIENT S303
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
You were still having those things before you started it?

PATIENT S303
I had it before I started the medications.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
And was it the same? Same sort of thing.

PATIENT S303
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
I don't think the prostate medication had anything to do with it.
(DOCTORS VISIT BETWEEN THEMSELVES REGARDING PATIENT'S TREATMENT)

PATIENT S303
Can I say something? When these first started.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Yeah.

PATIENT S303
I had to tell them that I was having seizures.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Yeah.

PATIENT S303
I've had two.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Right.

PATIENT S303
I mean I said real @@@ seizures cause I tried to tell them that I was having seizures for about two or three years before they actually even looked at the fact that I was having seizures, they ain't doing anything about it.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
But this doesn't sound like a seizure to me.

PATIENT S303
Okay but I had seizures.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
I understand that.

PATIENT S303
Okay.  I tried to tell them that I was having seizures and they didn't do anything.  Then I was in uh, with DOCTOR one day and he told me I was having a seizure and that's when they actually started giving me seizure medication.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S303
And I was on a different type of seizure medication and it actually didn't do anything.  They didn't really, it helped but it didn't really help.  It was like Depakote.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Oh okay.

PATIENT S303
And then they gave me another different type of seizure medication and that didn't do anything either and then they tried to give me this type of medication and it actually helped.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Well we can change medicines around to see other seizure medicines but we should also get @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR S303
An MRI was just done.

PATIENT S303
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
@@@.

PATIENT S303
They were telling me that they didn't see anything.

FIRST DOCTOR S303
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Oh okay.

FIRST DOCTOR S303
Yeah the MRI is in there under @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay, well that shouldn't.

PATIENT S303
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.  Um alright.

PATIENT S303
But they're telling me that my MRI looked normal.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
That’s good.  That’s good.  @@@.

PATIENT S303
I'm not, I'm not trying to tell them that they're wrong or anything but I'm telling them because sometimes people will be talking to me, I can hear it.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Right.

PATIENT S303
But it's like I'm in Never Never Land, I can't answer them or I can't respond to them and I have like uh, a glitch like, you have to see it, it's like some type of repetitive movement that I can't stop.  Like some type of.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
It's hard to explain, you'd have to see me when I do it and I have this strange shake.  I shake so bad sometimes I couldn't even hold a glass of water.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
And I even, when I eat, it's the same thing.  Again.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Well I think we, it sounds like.

PATIENT S303
It's some type of neurological.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Well whatever it is now, you're having less seizures so it's not something I mean I'm just trying to say that each, it's still a problem.

PATIENT S303
I'm not saying that it's not normal people.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Yes.

PATIENT S303
I'm just saying uh what they're trying to do with it would not, doesn't seem like we're going about it at the right rate for some reason or another.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.  So let's see if we can just adjusting @@@ medication.  You're on Depakote?

PATIENT S303
No I'm on.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Topamax.

PATIENT S303
Yeah Topamax.

FIRST DOCTOR S303
@@@.

PATIENT S303
And I'm taking 200 mg twice a day already.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
And I'm still having, it helped but we're not really managing it that well.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
When was the last time you went back to see them?  

FIRST DOCTOR S303
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay so why don't we set that up?

PATIENT S303
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR S303
I have that right here.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
Which @@@ somewhere we’re not making a real connection.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Alright so the only thing that I was worried about was maybe whether this prostate medicine was causing some of your problems and whether we just switch that to something else?

PATIENT S303
Okay.  No I don't think that.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
@@@  Okay. It doesn’t sound like that.  

PATIENT S303
No.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
It doesn't sound like you have a blockage or anything.

PATIENT S303
I don’t think so.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
I understand what you’re saying, but I don't think that's the problem.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Okay.

PATIENT S303
I really don't.

SECOND DOCTOR S303
Alright.

PATIENT S303

SECOND DOCTOR S303
