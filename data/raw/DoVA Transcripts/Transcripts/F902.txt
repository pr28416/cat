DOCTOR F902

DOCTOR F902
You mean Cabergoline. 

PATIENT F902
Yeah.  Ever since I been going to Jesse Brown, I been having problems man, you know what I'm saying.  I been getting sicker and sicker.  When I was at Lakeside, I didn’t have this  problem.

DOCTOR F902
Okay.

PATIENT F902
But over here I got all kind of problems.  I had open heart surgery, that it.  They had split me open, open my sternum and everything.  Because of that, the Cabergoline, it built plaque in my heart.

DOCTOR F902
Who told you that?

PATIENT F902
The doctor that did the surgery out at Hines and one of the doctors here as well told me that.  What it did, it destroyed my aorta, whatever that heart valve is over to the right side?

That's crazy.  They the one that gave me this medicine and caused the problem right.  I had no problem with my heart; my heart was in excellent condition till I come here.

DOCTOR F902
When were you diagnosed with the pituitary tumor?

PATIENT F902

I was falling out in the Marine Corps and they rushed me over to the dispensary whatever the PX, not the PX but the hospital stuff and I couldn't hardly get my breath and all kind of stuff you know but then when I came home my mother took me to Micheal Reese, they gave me a simple blood test and they gave me blood tests in the Marine Corps but they could find @@@ and they ain't found nothing in there you know.  They knew I had a tumor on my brain that's why they got me out with a medical and honorable condition.  Um that's how the military cause the government ain't crap I tell you.

Who prescribed you that, I don't see it in here?

PATIENT F902
Well it came, really actually from Hines again.

FIRST DOCTOR F902
Oh, oh.

PATIENT F902
But the heart doctors preferred that I have it, do I need it?

FIRST DOCTOR F902
If you're not having an irregular heart beat I don't think you need it.  But this is a good thing because you're gonna see the cardiologist within a couple days.

PATIENT F902
Yeah.

DOCTOR F902
So when you see them, they're the guys that really know about the amiodarone, they know about the heart rythms, they're the heart docs so if they wanted they can assess if you need it.

PATIENT F902
So in other words don't mess with it until I.

DOCTOR F902
Don't mess it until you've seen the cardiologist.

PATIENT F902
Cause he was saying something about it's a dangerous drug or something.

DOCTOR F902
