Time of Encounter:  @:@@ 

DOCTOR E143
PATIENT?  How ya doing?

PATIENT E143
Pretty well.

DOCTOR E143
Good to see you again, come on back.  I @@@.  So what's new?

PATIENT E143
I'm glad you asked.  I got a list.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
I uh, I had this Grover's disease for a couple of years now.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
It, it's not gone.  It's kind of in check uh still bugging me a little bit and, and the next thing.  When I take my cup of coffee in the morning and I lift it like this, my hand goes like this.

DOCTOR E143
Okay, that's new for you?

PATIENT E143
Well it's new in the last five or six months.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
Um and my, it doesn't have, you know any particular tremor but this is the one where I'm using several small muscles and when I get the coffee cup up to my, so I wanted to mention that to you.

DOCTOR E143
Is it just the one hand?

PATIENT E143
Well, I mean it's all I notice.  I, I don't feel any particular unease in my body.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
Or I'm not shaky going down stairs or anything like that.

DOCTOR E143
It's your right hand?

PATIENT E143
Yeah.

DOCTOR E143
Are you right-handed?

PATIENT E143
Yeah.

DOCTOR E143
You've never seen it in your left hand when you're doing stuff?

PATIENT E143
I tried on my left hand and uh, I, to a point it's similar but the place I, I first noticed it was my right hand.  @@@.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
So anyhow, I thought this might be a decent time to mention it.  It get, it's gotten a little bit more prominent in the last eh, you know as time goes along.

DOCTOR E143
And it doesn't happen all the time, just happens occasionally?

PATIENT E143
Just occasional.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
But I don't have any trouble putting keys in you know in a car or anything like that but.  Something else I noticed, I'm getting reflux.

DOCTOR E143
Okay what do you mean by reflux?

PATIENT E143
I get, if I, especially if I have something to eat after 7 o'clock at night.  I'll go to bed and I'm laying there and all of a sudden I get swallowing because the reflux, the gorge, the acid kind of a taste comes up through my trachea.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.  So you get like a strange taste in your mouth you're saying.

PATIENT E143
It's not a strange taste when it comes up, you just don't start swallowing junk.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
And so sometimes I get up and uh maybe just sit for awhile, go brush my teeth but that's happening, it probably happened eight or ten times in the last month.

DOCTOR E143
You've had this before too?

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
In your chart did somebody mention that you've had this reflux before?  What would have done that, that notion?  You've never had an endoscopy that I've seen in our system.

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
Ever have one a Loyola or anywhere else? No?

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
But.

DOCTOR E143
Have you ever had medication for that though?

PATIENT E143
No, but you know my squeeze (NAME), takes, she has reflux and so she's had the endoscopy and the different things and so she's been treated for it and so that's what makes me think I just had too much to eat probably.  That's a big factor.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
You know I need a piece of pumpkin pie and ice cream at 8:30 at night like another hole in the head right?

DOCTOR E143
Uh, have you noticed certain foods that make it worse?

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
Do you know a food that typically makes it worse.

PATIENT E143
Yeah, I always eat Haagen Daz ice cream.  @@@.

DOCTOR E143
@@@ It's possible but it's just not in the literature to say Haagen Das ice cream.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Tobacco, caffeine.

PATIENT E143
I don't drink.  I mean I don't drink that I can remember.  I don't smoke, never.

DOCTOR E143
Alcohol?  Caffeine?

PATIENT E143
Uh.  

DOCTOR E143
You told me you're drinking tea right?  Coffee right?

PATIENT E143
Yeah.  

DOCTOR E143
Uh minty stuff, like menthol?


PATIENT E143
Huh no.

DOCTOR E143
Um tomato and citrus stuff?

PATIENT E143
Maybe, I know I like pasta.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
And uh you know spaghetti and meatballs.

DOCTOR E143
Some people get it worse, if they eat spaghetti sauce they can tell right away, because they get bad reflux symptoms.

PATIENT E143
Yeah.

DOCTOR E143
And like you mentioned, it's classic.  If you eat right before you go to sleep, now that's the problem.  Then you lay flat and the stuff that you eat you're pushing it back into the esophagus.

PATIENT E143
Exactly.  And so it's almost like the hiccups, I mean here it comes. 

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
At 6 miles an hour.

DOCTOR E143
And it's not and it's not uh, you know it's not anything like, if you have it for a long time you get problems with changing of the cells that line your esophagus.

PATIENT E143
Okay.


DOCTOR E143
The cells that line the esophagus are a certain type of cell type and they're different than the ones in your stomach.  The ones in your stomach are used to the acidic environment.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
And if the esophagus gets exposed to this acid over and over, they start to change to resemble more of the ones in the stomach they got to cope with it.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
But as those cells change rapidly, there's a chance of developing cancer.  Something called Barrett's esophagus.  If we see a change in the cell type of your esophagus that tells us that you now are getting close to reflux but now you're having change in the cells.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
That puts you at risk for esophageal cancer.  So it's nothing that we need to worry about now.  I'm just saying, you know it's something to keep an eye on because it's something you want to treat.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Now your squeeze, well what kind of medicines did she take for that.

PATIENT E143
You know I really don't.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
Except that I know that it's been a problem for her for a few years now.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah okay.

PATIENT E143
And uh it hasn't, it's not cancerous.

DOCTOR E143
No, no I mean there's nothing to suspect that at this point and you need to know um that's nothing I'm worried about.  I'm just telling you, so this is why you know doctors can be concerned about this stuff.

PATIENT E143
Yeah.

DOCTOR E143
They need to think about it.

PATIENT E143
Well it suddenly occurred to me if it happens after 8:30 in the evening again, maybe it's like, @@@ I do this.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah don't do that yeah, yeah.

PATIENT E143
Okay I got that part.  Uh so those are the things I wanted to ask.  By the way I've got a friend who had shingles.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
It's horrible.

DOCTOR E143
Terrible.

PATIENT E143
Yes.  He said, he said have you ever had a shot for shingles, I said no why.  He said you can have like an antibody shot, a shot for shingles prior to getting shingles.

DOCTOR E143
Yes.

PATIENT E143
After which once you get it you're toast, you're in for the ride.  So here a guy that had an itch that I really don't feel comfortable with and uh and it held on for a while if I was just wondering if the shingle shots were available?

DOCTOR E143
Yeah we can get you one.  Uh they're probably going to be, so I donâ€™t think I could give it to you today, be able to schedule this for you, you have to come back and get it.

PATIENT E143
That's fine.

DOCTOR E143
But it's no problem.

PATIENT E143
But if it's available I'd like it.

DOCTOR E143
Did you get a flu shot this year?

PATIENT E143
No, hell no.

DOCTOR E143
You didn't get one?

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
I mean I got one when I was in the service in the 50s.

DOCTOR E143
You got to get it every year.

PATIENT E143
It gave me the flu every time Jesus.

DOCTOR E143
You can't get the flu from the shot.  Let me get this phone call.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

(DOCTOR ON PHONE CALL: 45:56 until 47:13)

DOCTOR E143
Okay, sorry about that.

PATIENT E143
No that's okay.  Uh the only thing else I got is, I got a friend, a lady, that socially I know, has had Grover's disease.  I said oh yeah I had that, @@@.  So she had some and she's a little obese but in any case she got light treatments for it and it was very effective.  Now I'm just sitting here, I'll get up sometimes in the middle of the night I'll have sensations on parts of my body and in Grover's disease it's laying there.  You know it's not dormant it's just preceded.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
I'm not comfortable.  I know its there.  I mean you know I just have the awareness, it's a cold shed that's all.  I just wondered if I got if I need to go to Dermatology and see if that might be an avenue that might.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
Put this in.

DOCTOR E143
I'm fine with that.

PATIENT E143
Yeah.

DOCTOR E143
I don't know enough about it to say whether it's a good idea.  I know I just looked at all the medications down for this and there are quite a few and I wouldn't be the one doing the treatment so I would say you call the Dermatology Clinic and say look I want to talk about this option.

PATIENT E143
Cool, I'll do that.  Other than that I guess uh.  What medicines do you show me getting?

DOCTOR E143
Uh terazosin, uh for prostate.  Finasteride, both those right?

PATIENT E143
Yeah.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.  You take uh simvastatin.

PATIENT E143
I take uh, simvastatin I don't take.

DOCTOR E143
You stopped taking it?

PATIENT E143
Just a minute I said the simvastatin I am taking.

DOCTOR E143
But it's not on the list.

PATIENT E143
Not on the list.

DOCTOR E143
It just expired that's all, renew it.

PATIENT E143
Okay.  I would like uh, I would like some medicine like a two months supply of medicines.  It's pretty stable, so a two or three month's supply of medicine of those three sent to me if you will.

DOCTOR E143
Sure.

PATIENT E143
Then @@@.

DOCTOR E143
I have some other creams and other stuff you use as well.

PATIENT E143
Yeah.  You know what, to be truthful with ya.

DOCTOR E143
Which ones of these don't you use?

PATIENT E143
Uh the cream that I don't use.

DOCTOR E143
Capsaicin, you use that one?

PATIENT E143
Capsaicin.  I don't use that.

DOCTOR E143
Okay we'll get rid of that one.

PATIENT E143
Okay and uh that's it.

DOCTOR E143
This uh, this steroid cream you still use?

PATIENT E143
Uh, yeah I've got some still in stock and once in a while if it bothers me.

DOCTOR E143
Which one do you use?

PATIENT E143
Uh, you know.

DOCTOR E143
The @@@ and another one, do you use both of them?

PATIENT E143
Uh, I should.

DOCTOR E143
@@@ this one @@@.  Do you use those?

PATIENT E143
Very, very sparingly.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
Usually on a hot spot, I've got maybe seven or eight spots on my body that are, they're more bothersome than others.  I mean I could, you can scratch it and you know you're in trouble.  It's one of those when I itch too good, kind of a deal.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah, okay.

PATIENT E143
I've got a half dozen of those spots on my body.

DOCTOR E143
What about these other ones, hydroxyzine, do you take the Zyrtec, do you still take any of those?

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
Okay I'll get rid of those and then that shampoo you still use?

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
You don't use that either?

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
I thought that stuff worked pretty good for you.

PATIENT E143
Ah it did but you know, I've got about six bottles of it.  Heck it was really designed to put on my body when I was in, pretty extreme.

DOCTOR E143
Flares right?

PATIENT E143
Yeah and uh and it was just supposed to be all over my body.  Well I never, I got a little better and I stopped using the darn stuff.   So it was like a salve really.

DOCTOR E143
Okay, I can stop it.

PATIENT E143
You can dump, yeah you can dump that.  That's my shopping list ho, ho, ho.

DOCTOR E143
Thatâ€™ my Christmas present, from me to you.

PATIENT E143
(Laughs) Whatever but uh, but uh the tremor I have it's this funny, odd motion where I'm using shoulder and different muscles you know and it comes up here and it's in the morning, maybe I'm not ready to give it a whirl or what.  It kind of catches me in the morning first thing.

DOCTOR E143
Uh alright lets.  

PATIENT E143
So the reflux, Iâ€™m good, we're gonna watch it if it's okay with you.

DOCTOR E143
No what's the.

PATIENT E143
And I'm not gonna eat after 8:30.

DOCTOR E143
That's, that's one way to do it.  Let's uh, there's a couple of things we could do about this really.  Um, Iâ€™m just looking at your last labs, itâ€™s been a while.  Okay, we need to recheck your blood on your next visit; we're fine on this visit okay.  And your blood pressure was okay um.  You ever take your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT E143
Um no.  I've never had high blood pressure.  As a matter of fact most surprising it's down in the 59 or 60s; it's usually be 70 and 110 or 112.

DOCTOR E143
Oh. Okay.  Alright come on here we'll take a listen.  I'll let you know what weâ€™re going to do with this stuff.  Okay.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Alright let's see your hands, stick them out in front of you all the way. You want to see a trick? This is what I do.  Keep your arm straight.  Ah see this doesn't count, @@@.

PATIENT E143
Stop.  Alto! I speak Spanish.

DOCTOR E143
Alright, so itâ€™s not that.

PATIENT E143
Now.

DOCTOR E143
@@@.

PATIENT E143
Iâ€™ll be truthful with you, if I didn't drink coffee I'd never even be talking about this.

DOCTOR E143
Is it only when you drink coffee that you get this?

PATIENT E143
Oh yeah, it's just that I'm sensitive.  You know hot coffee, you're pretty careful about things that you lift.  

DOCTOR E143
What Iâ€™m saying is it is after you drink coffee do you get the tremor?  

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
That's the first shot.

DOCTOR E143
Okay let's do this uh, finger of your right hand, touch your nose, touch my finger, nose again, touch my finger, nose.  Okay other hand, @@@.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
What that is it's called an essential tremor.  It kind of runs in families but a lot of times it doesn't.  It's nothing to worry about.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
It's not like a Parkinson's type thing.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
It's just stuff some people get.  It's like a nervous twitch.  More common in old age.  Unless it really bothers you and inhibits what you're doing, there's not a good treatment for, for tremors like that.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
So I would uh, you know I would just try to live with it the best you can.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
If it gets worse or you notice things happening when you're not moving, when you're just kind of resting and that's when we need to think about other things; so for now I would have you just.

PATIENT E143
Okay.  I'll just qualify it and if it gets worse.

DOCTOR E143
It's called essential tremor.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
You can look it up if you want but that's just, it's a benign thing.  It's nothing to worry about.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.  Breathe normal for now.  No chest pain, no trouble breathing?  Deep breath in and out. (Examining patient) Another deep breath.  Open your mouth, ah. 

PATIENT E143
Ah.

DOCTOR E143
Okay lay back for me and lift up your shirt as well. Can you unbutton or?  Okay up here?

PATIENT E143
Yeah.

DOCTOR E143
No change in appetite?

PATIENT E143
Yeah.

DOCTOR E143
No weight loss or anything like that?

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
Okay climb off.  Alright.  Um so this seems like reflux you're right.

PATIENT E143
Yeah.  Yeah now that bothered me cause she's had it for the last two or three years off and on.  You know fighting it and doing whatever, so she, we're very aware of it and the ramifications of course.

DOCTOR E143
Um, so the foods I mentioned that causes trouble with those foods or late at night um and then we'll try this medication.  We'll try it for a couple of weeks, maybe a month, two months to see how it does.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
@@@ for long period of time.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
So we'll use it @@@ and that's fine and at then at some point we'll try to stop it and see if the symptoms have improved even off of it.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Okay does that make sense?  It's called omeprazole when there's just lot of acid to your stomach, so if you have some reflux it doesn't cause any problems.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
It doesn't irritate the lining of the esophagus okay.

PATIENT E143
@@@ frequently she sleeps with two pillows so that her body is tilted a little up, it seems to help.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah it can help.  I don't @@@ for you.

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
Uh, give me a second and I'll be right back.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Oh you know what else, colonoscopy?

PATIENT E143
Yeah.

DOCTOR E143
When was your last colonoscopy, it says what was it five years ago or so?

PATIENT E143
Me?  Colonoscopy?  You know what I just had, I just had a operation for prostate and they went in through my.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah but that's not a colonoscopy.

PATIENT E143
Well, that's such a fun thing.

DOCTOR E143
You were probably donâ€™t need another one um we generally seem to stop screening about 75 to 80 uh but you had polyps on your last one right?  From what I remember.

PATIENT E143
Mmm.

DOCTOR E143
Uh so that's something that we need to look into.  If you have polyps you're supposed to follow them up every five years or so.

PATIENT E143
Yeah.  I.

DOCTOR E143
Hey I mean you're pretty healthy.

PATIENT E143
I don't want to be a hero or anything you know just.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
If it's time, we'll get the colonoscopy.

DOCTOR E143
Where'd you have it done last?

PATIENT E143
Out in Aurora at uh.

DOCTOR E143
In the VA Aurora?

PATIENT E143
Not in the VA.  I was using the Medicare.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
Uh.  I have a doctor out there at uh.

DOCTOR E143
Do you know what hospital you had it done at?

PATIENT E143
No.  Itâ€™s on the tip of my tongue, but I canâ€™t.

DOCTOR E143
@@@ Copley?

PATIENT E143
No.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
One farther out west uh.

DOCTOR E143
I'm not sure then.

PATIENT E143
Yeah.  

DOCTOR E143
You know what, I mean I'd like to see the records if you could get them.

PATIENT E143
I can.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah cause that would @@@ if you have to have one done here um.  You know for most people who are 76, I honestly say it's no problem, for you I think it's worthwhile doing.

PATIENT E143
I'm probably going to be around a while.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
Everything else equal.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
Okay.  I'll get em.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
Uh do you want me then to uh.

DOCTOR E143
You can just bring em with you next time if you want.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
You won't have to pay, bring em the next time you come in.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Um I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  59:41  DOCTOR IN:  64:04)

DOCTOR E143
Alright.  Um, let's try this medication called omeprazole for your stomach.

PATIENT E143
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR E143
Take it once a day.

PATIENT E143
Alright.

DOCTOR E143
It doesn't matter if you take it morning or night.  Take it in the morning with these other medications.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Now we'll try it for about three, two or three months.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
And we'll see how you do.  If your symptoms are not completely better we may have to do the scope to look for something else that could be causing this.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Fair enough?

PATIENT E143
Sounds good.


DOCTOR E143
Iâ€™ll see you in about three months, try to get those records for your colonoscopy.

PATIENT E143
In three months I'm gonna be in Florida.

DOCTOR E143
When you coming back?

PATIENT E143
Probably.

DOCTOR E143
Ever?  Are you coming back?

PATIENT E143
Well, yeah I come back when it gets warm up here.

DOCTOR E143
When, when is that?

PATIENT E143
Uh, I usually I'm down there for the month of March, big part of February.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.

PATIENT E143
So I usually get back April.

DOCTOR E143
So that's ah like six months or five months from now.

PATIENT E143
Yeah.


DOCTOR E143
Okay.  


PATIENT E143
Well obviously, I'm not going down for another month or two so you know, if these things haven't been alleviated.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah we usually want to use the medicine.

PATIENT E143
I'll be like on like a cold sweat.

DOCTOR E143
You want to use the medicine about eight weeks or so.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
But yeah I mean if you're, if you have no improvement after you know a couple weeks of this medication.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Let me know.

PATIENT E143
Okay I will.

DOCTOR E143
And uh you know what if the pain gets worse also on this medication you know let me know or you know the reflux symptoms get worse.

PATIENT E143
It is distressing to say the least.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah.

PATIENT E143
I mean it will wake you up like a shot.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah but I think we know what it is so that's pretty reassuring.

PATIENT E143
Okay, okay, that's good.

DOCTOR E143
And this usually treats it pretty well.  So, April will be about five months, we'll say five months we'll have you come back.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
We'll see how that's doing.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Like but yeah in the meantime, if it's getting worse or anything, just let me know so we can try to get you set up for this.  We'll get some baseline um blood draws today.

PATIENT E143
Okay alright. I already had a blood draw.

DOCTOR E143
Which order did they fill?

PATIENT E143
I got here at 2:30 I think.


DOCTOR E143
@@@.  For your PSA?

PATIENT E143
Uh, they never, I just went down and got it because they said come in early, get some blood drawn, but I didn't have, they didn't die it or anything.

DOCTOR E143
Yeah, @@@ from the Radiation oncologist.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
What we need um, I want to check your blood levels with this and uh your Lipitor for next time you come in, your cholesterol panel.  We just need a fasting lab.

PATIENT E143
Okay.  I'll get my blood taken again.

DOCTOR E143
So yeah, I'll let you get your blood taken again today.

PATIENT E143
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E143
And then again before you come in next time.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Fasting, so you don't have to do it now, you can do it in April but you need to do it fasting.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
@@@.

PATIENT E143
Even this time, so I should fast for this time?

DOCTOR E143
No so this time we could do it right now before you leave.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.  Next time you come see me, in five months.

PATIENT E143
Well you say we'll have a baseline and we'll be able to.


DOCTOR E143
Uh come with the colonoscopy record, come with this lipid panel.

PATIENT E143
Yeah.

DOCTOR E143
And the cholesterol panel and uh I will put a the desk â€“ the vaccine is called the Zoster vac.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
You know what, when they call back in to do the Zoster vac, you could do the blood draw then if you want.

PATIENT E143
Yep, okay.

DOCTOR E143
Or you can do it today.

PATIENT E143
Okay, when would that?

DOCTOR E143
I think it should be in the next week.

PATIENT E143
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR E143
Okay.  

PATIENT E143
Uh, you know.  As long as I'm here I might as well have the blood drawn.

DOCTOR E143
Okay, that is fine.

PATIENT E143
I'll just stop on the way out so.  Okay, so I'll be sure I have the, why can't I think of that hospital?

DOCTOR E143
I don't know, the only one I know out there is the Copley.  They'll mail this stuff out to you, the medication uh.  You should be getting it in the mail and @@@.

PATIENT E143
I'm kinda figuring that will pretty much tie me over till you know.  I don't want to be in Florida and running out, that's the whole thinking.  Once you change your address to send it to you that's your new address and I got to change it back.

DOCTOR E143
Well the thing is yeah I don't want it, you know this medicine is for a limited time use so if you're using it five months down the road that's, we like to see is to use it for two or three months.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
And see how it does and then stop it.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
That's the idea.  We don't want you on this for a long time.

PATIENT E143
Alright.  That will work.

DOCTOR E143
Okay, alright.  We'll get you set up.  Get your blood drawn here.  So they'll call you when they're ready after that you will see the nurse who will get you set up for the vaccine.

PATIENT E143
Okay.

DOCTOR E143
@@@ on your way out just drop off the form and they'll do the packet.

PATIENT E143
But today I'm gonna @@@ what?

DOCTOR E143
Today you get the blood drawn and then the nurse will see you to schedule all that stuff.  Okay.

PATIENT E143
@@@.

DOCTOR E143
Just have a seat and they'll call you.

PATIENT E143
Okay, thanks a lot.
