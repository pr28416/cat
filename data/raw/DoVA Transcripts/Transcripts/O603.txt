PATIENT O603
Excellent, excellent.

PATIENT O603
We're doing 502 games last year.

DOCTOR O603
Gee.

PATIENT O603
And you may be able to see that my blood pressure is down.

DOCTOR O603
Yes.

PATIENT O603
I don't want those cholesterol pills we were talking about.

DOCTOR O603
You don't want them?

PATIENT O603
No thanks.

DOCTOR O603
I thought I started you on them.

PATIENT O603
Well you told me you put me on something else too.  I thought if I didn't get my cholesterol down yeah.

DOCTOR O603
Yeah.  Did you start taking that other medicine though?

PATIENT O603
Yeah I started taking it but I didn't continue.

DOCTOR O603
Oh so I did two things last time.  I increased your blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT O603
Yes.

DOCTOR O603
So you've been taking that increased dose?

PATIENT O603
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR O603
And then you didn't take the cholesterol medicine?

PATIENT O603
No.  They started just making me feel kind of bad at first so.

DOCTOR O603
In what way?

PATIENT O603
Just kind of out of sorts.

DOCTOR O603
Okay.  I wish I'd come last week.  I was even lighter.  I was down to 183 last week.

PATIENT O603
You were, oh yeah you lost since the last time I saw you.

DOCTOR O603
Yes sir.  Well losing weight, you probably don't need that medicine then.

PATIENT O603
I'm just living a little better.

DOCTOR O603
Good.

PATIENT O603
My buddy NAME comes over.  I stopped him from coming over with that halftime juice.

DOCTOR O603
Not fun without alcohol?

PATIENT O603
No fun no, no.  Having one game and one of the kids asked me hey ref uh whose ball is that so at the time I said whose ball and I thought I don't know, so I had to go ask my partner whose ball is it?  And I said uh uh that's it.  You know when you really kind of a nondrinker you shouldn't mess with stuff like jam.

DOCTOR O603
Yeah it's better not to drink.

PATIENT O603
Dinner wine is okay?

DOCTOR O603
Huh, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

DOCTOR O603
How's the knee going?

PATIENT O603
Oh about the same.

DOCTOR O603
How often are you using the pain med?

PATIENT O603
Uh oh probably once a week.

DOCTOR O603
Okay.

PATIENT O603
And then my prescription ran out.  I was so surprised I went on to my Healthy Vet to order the naproxen and it was not there anymore.

DOCTOR O603
Alright.  I'll see if we can renew it.

PATIENT O603
Now I understand.

DOCTOR O603
How many, so you're taking it once a week.  How many pills do you usually take, is it like once a week?

PATIENT O603
Uh at least two and sometime I take two every four or six hours and if I keep that up for a day or so, maybe a day and a half I don't have any problem for a few weeks.

DOCTOR O603
So. The naproxen, you’re only supposed to take that twice a day.  And don't take so much, okay.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

DOCTOR O603
I mean don't take any more because it could hurt your kidneys.

PATIENT O603
Sure.

DOCTOR O603
Your stomach, your kidneys, all that stuff.  If you need more, just take the Tylenol or something with it then okay.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

DOCTOR O603
But the naproxen take it twice a day or if you want to take it.

PATIENT O603
Well I don't take it every day.

DOCTOR O603
I know, I know, but when you do, just take it twice.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

DOCTOR O603
And it lasts a long time.

PATIENT O603
It does.

DOCTOR O603
That's why it’s twice a day.  If you wanted something more often you can just take regular Advil or ibuprofen or something.

PATIENT O603
That's what I've been doing, since I been out of this for.

DOCTOR O603
Has that been working?

PATIENT O603
A couple of months.

DOCTOR O603
Ibuprofen.

PATIENT O603
Yeah.

DOCTOR O603
Okay, so let's keep doing that then okay.

PATIENT O603
Well actually I haven't been taking, what's the brand name for naproxen?

DOCTOR O603
Aleve.

PATIENT O603
Aleve.

DOCTOR O603
Oh I see, so you can take that twice a day.  You want me to give you some Tylenol or something, try that.  Prevent any @@@ issues.  You need refills on any other meds?

PATIENT O603
Yes.  Uh my blood pressure medicines I probably got at least another month, close to a month on those.  Uh happy pills, I've been out for a long time of those.

DOCTOR O603
You need more?

PATIENT O603
Yeah.

DOCTOR O603
Take off your jacket for me.  Can you stiffen the arm for one second?  Deep breath.  No chest pain, shortness of breath, no other problems, urinary, bowel problems?

PATIENT O603
Well you know I @@@.

DOCTOR O603
Alright.

PATIENT O603
And at one point I was seeing some blood then I found out that I had scratched myself with some tissue and it wasn't coming from @@@ it was on the outside.

DOCTOR O603
Were straining a lot?

PATIENT O603
I was yeah, yeah.  I've been straining a lot, yeah.  Yeah that's kind of a constant @@@.

DOCTOR O603
Do you have a lot of fiber in your diet?

PATIENT O603
Probably all kinds @@@.  I don't know that I eat a lot of rice. I love rice.

DOCTOR O603
Brown rice has more fiber than white rice.

PATIENT O603
I do have some brown rice.

DOCTOR O603
So eat brown rice, that's better.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

DOCTOR O603
Eat wheat bread instead of white better.

PATIENT O603
Okay I'll start eating wheat bread.

DOCTOR O603
It's the kind of eating foods like vegetables, fruit, they all have fiber.

PATIENT O603
I eat a lot of fruit uh, a lot of vegetables and I have been eating a lot of tomatoes and cucumbers, almost daily and maybe last two weeks.  I kind of thought that was.  Well this is what's happened about @@@ and when it's time for me to go to the bathroom sometime it's so intense that I almost don't make it to the toilet.

DOCTOR O603
How often do you go to the bathroom?  Do you know?

PATIENT O603
Four times a day at least and that's the normal and has been all my life.

DOCTOR O603
Having @@@ urinating or stool?

PATIENT O603
Bowel movements.

DOCTOR O603
Four bowel movements a day?  I mean is it diarrhea or is it hard?

PATIENT O603
It's mixed.  It's not diarrhea.

DOCTOR O603
Well let me try you on a stool softener then to make sure you're not constipated.

PATIENT O603
You know I really don't feel constipated.  It's just I guess when I do go like, it's just I have to try to make sure that everything gets out.

DOCTOR O603
Don't do that okay.  Relax, don't strain. Straining will cause hemorrhoids and @@@ and then you get hemorrhoids and bowels movements are painful will cause fissures and then it really can go down @@@ okay.  So try to get a lot more fiber in your diet and then don't strain.

PATIENT O603
I @@@.

DOCTOR O603
Well you know anything that has high fiber.  You can even just take some fiber supplements if you want.  @@@ it's better to do that okay.  

PATIENT O603
Uh that's.

DOCTOR O603
Yeah no that's fine.

PATIENT O603
The main thing I wanted to talk to you about there's so many times well actually a couple months ago I would take off my underwear and it's like you know I got kind of stains like I been leaking and I know I don't have a gallbladder anymore. I had it removed in 2000. I don't know if that's from too much fat intake but I was told that's why.  I eat really low caffeine, no fat diet @@@.

DOCTOR O603
And you think you're making it to the bathroom whenever you go?

PATIENT O603
Generally I do but there have been some times, twice, three times that I didn't get there.

DOCTOR O603
Has this been going on for a long time?

PATIENT O603
I thought I could sit down.  Yes so I try not to eat when we're going out to make sure if there's a bathroom I can use cause usually right after I eat uh I have to go sometimes within 15 minutes.

DOCTOR O603
If this has been going on @@@.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

DOCTOR O603
@@@ too.

PATIENT O603
Well this has been going on probably since, twenty years or so, so that’s why I thought it was regular for me.

DOCTOR O603
Well let's do this, try to eat a lot more fiber.  Take, find some supplements and take them a couple times a day and if it's still happening next time we'll refer you to GI and they can do some testing and check your sphincter and that kind of thing, if you're not as tight @@@.

PATIENT O603
Yeah.

DOCTOR O603
You don't control it as well.

PATIENT O603
Yeah that's what I was thinking.

DOCTOR O603
Any weakness or anything.  Problems urinating or anything like this?  So just try the fiber for now and I'll put in a stool softener here to try making it @@@.  Okay.

PATIENT O603
Alright.  I was just concerned about the leaking. You know, why is it @@@.  For the last week or so I haven't had the problem.

DOCTOR O603
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT O603
Now with the gallbladder, it was explained to me that my gallbladder surgeon as sort of called it a “grease trap.” @@@ Is that correct?

DOCTOR O603
@@@ grease trap @@@ helps digest it better.

PATIENT O603
So, without one if I eat anything greasy, I don’t eat fried foods anymore @@@.

DOCTOR O603
That's fine.  Maybe it will come out of your stool sometimes but that shouldn't affect whether you know have any @@@.

PATIENT O603
It's embarrassing.  You around guys and you have to change clothes for wrestling in the locker room and I quick pull out, I stopped wearing white underwear @@@.

DOCTOR O603
@@@.

PATIENT O603
But it's kind of embarrassing often times.

DOCTOR O603
Well try this and if it doesn’t work, we'll send you to the GI doctors okay @@@. I'll be right back.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  34:02  DOCTOR IN:  35:15)

DOCTOR O603
Alright sir. So actually this will probably uh we'll see you in six months.

PATIENT O603
Yeah.

DOCTOR O603
Or sooner if you're having @@@.

PATIENT O603
I thought I'd come in three.  You know I always have to come back in three months because one of my prescriptions runs out every 90 days.

DOCTOR O603
Now do you.  There's refills though.  We always give you three refills.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

DOCTOR O603
You know @@@.  If you want @@@.

PATIENT O603
Well what I was wondering, I don't get refills on the happy pills.

DOCTOR O603
Uh.

PATIENT O603
Okay.  I mean I do and they generally send them automatically.

DOCTOR O603
Yeah you have three refills.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

DOCTOR O603
So you get two pills with three refills.

PATIENT O603
Okay.  So after 90 days, after three months then that one's gone by the wayside.

DOCTOR O603
So technically, this is.  But technically you're only allowed two pills a month.

PATIENT O603
Oh I understand that.  But I'm saying that.

DOCTOR O603
Actually two pills, uh so you need the happy pills, that's the reason you come back every three months.

PATIENT O603
Right, yeah it's in three months.  You know if there was another way but they say you always have to see a doctor before you.

DOCTOR O603
Then @@@.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

DOCTOR O603
And @@@.

PATIENT O603
Alright.

DOCTOR O603
So then um you come back in six months, this is the last time you'll see me cause I'm leaving in June alright.

PATIENT O603
Oh man.  Where you going?

DOCTOR O603
I don't know yet.  I might like to stay and just do like hospital medicine here.

PATIENT O603
Okay.

DOCTOR O603
Or somewhere else.

PATIENT O603
Maybe you'll still be in the VA System?

DOCTOR O603
Maybe I don't know yet.  I just know I'm interviewing and stuff like that.

PATIENT O603
Trying to make some money now.  Okay.

DOCTOR O603

PATIENT O603

PATIENT O603

DOCTOR O603
Yeah.

PATIENT O603

DOCTOR O603
Oh that's why I'm a doctor right.

PATIENT O603
