PATIENT M224
I spoke to somebody one other time about it and we were halfway home and they even called on the cell phone and told me no I couldn't do the rest of the pills, I could only do two at one time.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.

PATIENT M224
But she still won't do it at one time.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.  Well let me look.  I'm going to look and see what the maximum dose of that is because.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
What we all want is for you know.

PATIENT M224
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR M224
For the pain to go away but then have you know.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
Some other issues so, let me just see what the maximum dose for that is okay.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
What would we do without, let's see so you're taking three or four.

PATIENT M224
Yes.

DOCTOR M224
Pills how many times a day?

PATIENT M224
Sometimes two and three times a day.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

A lot of times it's up through the night.  I get up out of bed at night.  Now DOCTOR gave me some other pills now.

DOCTOR M224

PATIENT M224
Put me back on amitriptyline, I think that's what you call it.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M224

PATIENT M224
Yeah and he took away the Depakote.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.

PATIENT M224
The Depakote.

SECOND PERSON M224
What was that actually for?

DOCTOR M224
Amitriptyline?

SECOND PERSON M224
Yeah.

DOCTOR M224
Amitriptyline is a, it's a type of antidepressant but it's one of those medicines that helps with pain as well so it's sort of a.

PATIENT M224
Helps you sleep.

DOCTOR M224
Sort of helps with sleep, it helps with pain.  It's general class is that it's a type of antidepressant.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Um but it helps with, helps with sleep and pain um which is what it seems like its being used for here.  So the issue is the maximum dose is not to exceed 400 mg of the tramadol per day and it sounds like you're exceeding that.  You're getting, you're getting probably at least 600 if not 800 it sounds like per day.  So, we gotta do something with your pain to try to adjust this okay.  So we'll talk about, we'll talk about that.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224

So that one's at the bottom of my list here too so.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
I don't know why those would show up at the bottom but.  Um the B vitamin.

PATIENT M224
Yes.

DOCTOR M224
We'll renew.

PATIENT M224
Yes.

DOCTOR M224
Now the bupropion you take.  The glipizide you take and the metformin.

PATIENT M224
Yes.

DOCTOR M224
Half a tablet three times a day.  Do you know why you take that one three times a day?

PATIENT M224
Uh.

DOCTOR M224
You know did you ever try that one twice a day?

PATIENT M224
Which one?

SECOND PERSON M224
Metformin.

DOCTOR M224
The metformin.

PATIENT M224
Yeah but the metformin is for diabetes.

DOCTOR M224
Yes it's for diabetes.  Normally it's a twice a day medicine so I'm just trying to think of why.

PATIENT M224
Yeah but I think it's probably because they got me cutting them in half.

DOCTOR M224
You're cutting them in half okay.

PATIENT M224
So.

DOCTOR M224
Alright so let me get these ones taken care of for you.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Okay so we're going to give you the venlafaxine.  Uh-huh.  So all these refills, we’ll get them all.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
This one right here.  Capsaicin cream.  The computer's running pretty slow today.

PATIENT M224
Yeah.

DOCTOR M224
That happens usually. Anything else going on that?

PATIENT M224
Oh I uh.

DOCTOR M224
You think I need to know about?

PATIENT M224
Now you already checked that, the x-rays of my foot?  My left foot?

DOCTOR M224
Yeah I'll take a look at them again but I think we looked at them.

PATIENT M224
I tripped on a gate, getting over a gate and I almost broke my foot.  It hurt all the way to my hip.

DOCTOR M224
Huh.

PATIENT M224
And when, that was because of the gate it got locked from the dining room to the kitchen.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
Because they’re little, she's only 1-year-old now.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
Cause she'll get in the dog water and the cat box.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
Everything she's not supposed to.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.

PATIENT M224
So you got to put gates up.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah, when they're at that age when they get into everything.

PATIENT M224
And now she's starting to climb up the steps and she's already been up on the third one.  Going up stairs now, we got 16 steps so.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
So that gives me exercise too, going up and down.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah, uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
Which is good.

DOCTOR M224
Alright, okay.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
I just want to double check your creatinine.

PATIENT M224
Yeah.  And then if I can get your phone number just in case I need to call.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT M224
Because otherwise you call the main hospital they send you through this way and that way and wait a minute I'll see if I can't and pretty soon you’re lost.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.  You know let me check, I think I forgot them at home today.  I have the number, I have a card and then I left the box at home unfortunately.  So I don't have the cards today but I'll give you the number to call.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
And we'll go from there okay.  I'll need to sign all these medicines to get them refilled for you.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
So here are all the medicines.

PATIENT M224
Let @@@ portion and put the phone number on there.

SECOND PERSON M224
@@@.

DOCTOR M224
Okay so.

PATIENT M224
I didn't mean that turkey @@@.

SECOND PERSON M224
@@@.

PATIENT M224
I figure what I take, the kind of medicine we take for @@@ they make it out of turkeys.

SECOND M224
@@@.

PATIENT M224
No.

DOCTOR M224
Alright.

THIRD PERSON M224
@@@ a lot.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

THIRD PERSON M224
@@@.

DOCTOR M224
Alright.

SECOND PERSON M224
That's usually @@@.

THIRD PERSON M224
@@@.

SECOND PERSON M224
@@@.

THIRD PERSON M224
@@@.

PATIENT M224
This one is not for water, the furosemind is right?

DOCTOR M224
Well the furosemide is the water pill.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
That makes you pee and the lisinopril is a blood pressure medicine and it helps protect your kidneys when you have diabetes and you have diabetes so it's good for that too.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

THIRD PERSON M224
All these medicines, @@@.

DOCTOR M224
Now that one make sure you're on the service connection things.

PATIENT M224
Yeah.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.  Alright so your medications are all done.

PATIENT M224
I ordered them on the internet too which is cool.

DOCTOR M224
Oh good yeah that's cool.  Now the last thing I wanted to figure out is what we're gonna do about your pain because it's just not good to take so much of that tramadol.

PATIENT M224
Okay.  Now the other thing I follow which is pretty weird I have diabetes.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
Uh man I was really runny low.  I was getting down on my blood sugar count was down in the 50s and 60s.

DOCTOR M224
Oh okay.

PATIENT M224
But the wife give me some hard candy to eat.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
These little sucker things.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
They're all in a wrapper.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
And you take and you, I got in the habit now of sticking about eight of them at a time.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
And then I feel really good and then I don't even take that pain medicine so much.  I don't know where it works together at.

DOCTOR M224
Hmm.

PATIENT M224
Because you know it don't make any sense right?

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.  Yeah how often are you having real lows with your sugars?

PATIENT M224
Oh not too often just very seldom.

DOCTOR M224
Very seldom okay.

PATIENT M224
Yeah when I run out of candy I suck a lot of that candy all the time.

DOCTOR M224
Okay, so you don't have, you don't take insulin do you?

PATIENT M224
No I just take the pills, the glipizide and the metformin.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
That's what it's for right?

DOCTOR M224
Okay so yeah this is my thought then okay.  When we get your labs done, if your blood sugar is still as controlled as it has been in the past maybe we'll try to take the glipizide off and just do the metformin.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Because the metformin works in a little bit different way and doesn't cause any lows.

PATIENT M224
Oh okay.

DOCTOR M224
Glipizide can cause some lows.

PATIENT M224
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR M224
And if you're still well controlled like you have been in the past.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
Maybe we can stop the glipizide and then check you again.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
You know in a little bit okay.

PATIENT M224
And that'll be another pill off the list right?

DOCTOR M224
Yeah and so then we just want to make sure though with the glipizide that you're eating on a regular basis.

PATIENT M224
Right, right.

DOCTOR M224
You know, eat regular meals.

PATIENT M224
Right, right.

DOCTOR M224
And things like that okay.

PATIENT M224
Right, right.  Okay.

THIRD PERSON M224
@@@.

DOCTOR M224
Have you seen the physical therapist um.

PATIENT M224
Yeah that's how I got my.

DOCTOR M224
That's how you got your new scooter.

PATIENT M224
They were going to hook me up for an @@@ for that therapist had a thing for my neck and my shoulders, but I never heard anything back from him so.

DOCTOR M224
Let's, let me see cause I @@@.

PATIENT M224
Yeah it hurts like uh, it feels like a burning at times.  You know it'll hurt; that ache and pain, it feels like it's burning every once in a while, light burning so I don't know what that is.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.

PATIENT M224
What it's got to do with that but I used to think it was my shirts once in a while but it's got to be the uh, I don't know of course then I got arthritis.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.

PATIENT M224
What kind of arthritis I got, I got some other crap.

DOCTOR M224
So let's see what they thought they were gonna do.  Okay alright well maybe we'll talk about hooking you up with the physical therapist again to see if they can give you any exercises that help your pain because we're, you're not getting very good control here with the tramadol and you can't take as much of it regularly as you are.

PATIENT M224
Well the tramadol is not only for my neck and shoulders; it's for my back and my legs.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT M224
Straighten the whole body out.

DOCTOR M224
Right.  So okay.  Can you take a seat up here so I can take a listen to you?

PATIENT M224
Absolutely.  Here baby.

SECOND PERSON M224
Alright.

PATIENT M224
You want me to take my jacket off?

DOCTOR M224
Uh yes please.

PATIENT M224
@@@.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
Is this good?

DOCTOR M224
Yep you're good.  Actually can you swing around so your legs are down there?  And when was the last time you got your eyes checked?

PATIENT M224
My eyes?

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
Uh I don't know they got to call me up again.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.  But you're once a year right.  You go once a year to get your eyes checked?

PATIENT M224
Yeah, they check. The main thing is for diabetes.

DOCTOR M224
Yep you want look for the diabetes.

PATIENT M224
But my eyes are so messed up.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
There's things that they should do but they're not going to do it, they're gonna leave me alone.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

SECOND PERSON M224
If I'd brought my inhaler I wouldn't be in this predicament.

DOCTOR M224
Deep breaths in and out.  Can you lay back for me so I can take a look?  Your cough doesn't sound good.

SECOND PERSON M224
I know.

PATIENT M224
It's really bad and @@@.  She does that at night when we're sleeping.

SECOND PERSON M224
Oh be quiet.

PATIENT M224
It wakes me up when I'm asleep.

SECOND PERSON M224
Oh boo hoo.

PATIENT M224
It's like being in a combat zone.

SECOND PERSON M224
Boo hoo.

DOCTOR M224
Any belly pain?

PATIENT M224
Uh no not right now.  Oh yeah right there was one.

DOCTOR M224
Any pain that’s new?

PATIENT M224
I think @@@ telling you what's wrong.  It feels like really weird here.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
Of course I got a little pain down there where @@@ I think that's where the stich was when they went in.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
And you know it's just.

DOCTOR M224
@@@ your stuff.

PATIENT M224
Yeah.

DOCTOR M224
Any swelling in your legs at all?

PATIENT M224
No.

DOCTOR M224
No.

PATIENT M224
Now this one I had a @@@ one and that's where I tripped, its turning purple, yellow.

DOCTOR M224
Is it getting better now?

PATIENT M224
Oh yes much better.  You can hardly see it now.

DOCTOR M224
Okay good.  Okay alright you can sit back up and I'm going to push that in.  Alright you can come on down here.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Hmm.  Alright so a few things @@@.  So screening things it looks like you would be due for an ultrasound of your abdomen.  Have you ever had one of those?

PATIENT M224
Uh maybe.  I don't know I've had different things done up here.  Sometimes multi-times but it's always good to have just in case.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.  So we recommend that once you turn 65 years old, if you smoked more than a pack of cigarettes in your entire life you should get an ultrasound of your belly to look at your aorta down in your belly to make sure that it's not dilated at all.

PATIENT M224
Oh they've already run that thing down my throat to come to find out that I have a hiatal hernia.

DOCTOR M224
Hiatal hernia.

PATIENT M224
They gave me a purple pill one time and they took it away I don't know why.

DOCTOR M224
Nexium probably.

PATIENT M224
Yeah.

DOCTOR M224
So that will look into your stomach.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Um and this is a little bit different so I think if you don't have any objections I'll just order that study.

PATIENT M224
Oh that thing that they run around your stomach with uh.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah it's like an ultrasound like they're looking for a baby in.

PATIENT M224
Yeah they put this goop on your.

DOCTOR M224
Like the same as yeah.

SECOND PERSON M224
You've already had this?

THIRD PERSON M224
Yeah of the heart.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah so you've had an ultrasound of your kidneys before.

PATIENT M224
Yes.

DOCTOR M224
That's the same thing.

PATIENT M224
Not too long ago.

DOCTOR M224
The same they they just look at your aorta.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Okay um so we'll do, I'll put in the order for that.  They'll call you to set it up.

PATIENT M224
Okay.  Now instead of having that uh colonoscopy again.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
I know you’re supposed to.  They did it twice up here a while back.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
But instead of doing that isn't there something else they can do?

DOCTOR M224
Um.

PATIENT M224
That accomplishes the same deal?

DOCTOR M224
They can do um, we can do cards.  Let me see what your last colonoscopy showed and when you need to do it again.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
Um do you remember ever having polyps?

PATIENT M224
Uh.

DOCTOR M224
Or when you had your colonoscopy did they take any samples out or tell you anything?

PATIENT M224
I'm not sure of any of that.  Yeah cause they must have because the first time they said some @@@.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.  In 2006 it looks like.

PATIENT M224
Yeah see we cheated because it was a whole two days, that's tough before you did the thing and then they did it in a different way when you drink that junk.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
And you didn't have to do the @@@ a big white bottle, they changed all that so you only did the white bottle.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
And they come to find out I guess what in the first eight inches or something like this and ask her, they got to go over something.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
They could go on up, they had a problem.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.

PATIENT M224
And it hurt like a sucker.

DOCTOR M224
So it looks like, from what I can tell uh they took some biopsies but there was nothing uh.

PATIENT M224
It was clean and green.  I understand that they said I didn't have any cancer.

DOCTOR M224
Yes.  Yep.

PATIENT M224
Cancer clean.

DOCTOR M224
Yep no cancers, no cancer.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
So um they're looking no polyps, nothing in the colon so they didn't even find any polyps.  They actually just took a few biopsies cause you had been having some abdominal pain or something.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
So you had a clean colonoscopy in 2006 which means you're not due again until 2016.

PATIENT M224
Oh great!

DOCTOR M224
So you don't have to worry about that.

PATIENT M224
Thank you.

DOCTOR M224
Quite yet okay.

PATIENT M224
Yes.

DOCTOR M224
So that's good and then the final um.

PATIENT M224
Cause the worse thing about the colonoscopy is drinking the white crap.

DOCTOR M224
You have to drink the white stuff.

PATIENT M224
And @@@.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
And you know your tushy gets so sick after drinking that crap.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah.

PATIENT M224
You know toilet paper, I don't know if the toilet paper even works right but.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.  So we're almost done here.  Um the only other thing.  So there are two things left, one is that I have to tell you I recommend highly that you stop smoking and you stop smoking and if you stop smoking and no smoking in the house, that's just for your health and everything that we know.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
It's very important.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
So if there's anything that I can do to help you with that, including setting you up with the Smoking Cessation Clinic here for uh if you are interested in nicotine patches you know I can and will provide those to you.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Um so do you want me to set any of those up for you?

PATIENT M224
Nicotine patches?

DOCTOR M224
Nicotine patch. 

PATIENT M224
Can you do that yes.

DOCTOR M224
I can.  You smoke very few cigarettes.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
So you don't.

PATIENT M224
So yeah.

DOCTOR M224
I can set you up with the lowest.

PATIENT M224
Yes.

DOCTOR M224
Dose.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Of the nicotine patches.

PATIENT M224
Cause the last time I was here, the night they made me stay over.

DOCTOR M224
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M224
Yeah they put nicotine patches on me too.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
I think they switched one, you know but I know that yeah they used them over here.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah okay.  So I'll do that for you.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Okay so that'll be good.

PATIENT M224
Now the wife may not successfully quit but I have to.

DOCTOR M224
Yep.

PATIENT M224
I've had two strokes.

DOCTOR M224
Yep.

PATIENT M224
Two heart attacks.

DOCTOR M224
Yes.

PATIENT M224
I got four stents.

DOCTOR M224
Yep you got to quit smoking.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
You gotta quit smoking.

PATIENT M224
Okay doc.

DOCTOR M224
Okay cause you've got a lot of issues that are related.  Especially with your Agent Orange history with both of those combined.

PATIENT M224
Yeah.

DOCTOR M224
You gotta quit smoking um and then the last uh screening thing is that the VA recommends that every veteran between the ages of 18 and 120 get screened at least one time for HIV so I can order that blood test for you for the next time you come in and get labs done.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
If you don't mind.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
That'll be the 31st.

DOCTOR M224
That'll be the 31st and we'll get some labs done then.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
And I think you're up-to-date, let me check your immunizations to make sure.  You had the flu shot, you got the pneumonia shot.  Um the only other thing is for your tetanus shot, you had the tetanus shot in 2010 and those last in and of themselves 10 years before you need another booster so technically you're not due for the tetanus part until 2020 but the new tetanus vaccinations also protect against whooping cough.

PATIENT M224
Okay I'll take it.

DOCTOR M224
So I'll get you that today before you leave okay.

PATIENT M224
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Alright so we'll do that.  Alright so I'm just gonna go talk to my supervisor quick but I think your blood pressure's well controlled.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Hopefully your diabetes is as well controlled as it was back the last time it was checked but we'll check it again at the end of the month.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
If that's still okay we'll talk about going down on that glipizide.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
To make sure you know stop you from having those lows.  Um we'll get you set up with the nicotine patches, with the tetanus shot and with the triple A screen and then we'll see you back sometime soon okay.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
So let me just uh, let me just go talk to them and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT M224
Okay doc.

DOCTOR M224
I think I'm also going to try to get you hooked up with the physical therapist again cause I want to see what, if anything, they can do to help with your pain.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Alright.  Any more questions right now?

PATIENT M224
No.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT M224
Okay doc.

DOCTOR M224
Alright.  @@@.

PATIENT M224
Yes.

DOCTOR M224
Do we need to talk about @@@.

(DOCTOR OUT:  87:37  DOCTOR IN:  95:55)

DOCTOR M224
Okay so.  Alright just like I said we're gonna do what we talked about so I'm going to order you the ultrasound of your abdomen and they'll call you to set that up.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.  They might be able to set it up for you before you leave so let me put the order in right now and see.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Um.

SECOND PERSON M224
Where does he get that shot at?

DOCTOR M224
He gets it right here before he leaves so I will put in the order okay.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
Uh if you could do it on the 31st, would you want to do it all on one day and just have?

PATIENT M224
Yes.

DOCTOR M224
Everything, let's see if they can do that.

PATIENT M224
Sure would.

DOCTOR M224
Okay so we'll do that, let me do.

PATIENT M224
So I think my appointment is at 1:30 or 2 in the afternoon.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
On the 31st.

DOCTOR M224
Okay we'll order your tetanus.  Okay and the nicotine patches.  Do you want to pick up the nicotine patches or do you want them mailed to you?

PATIENT M224
You can mail them to me.

DOCTOR M224
Mail them to you okay then I'll do that so you won't have to wait for that.  So we'll get some labs done at the end of the month when you come back.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
We'll get this triple A screen, we'll get you the tetanus shot and we'll get you the patches um and okay.

PATIENT M224
Yes.

DOCTOR M224
We refilled all of your medicines so you should be set there um how about now I'm trying to think when I want to see you back.  So how about in the next 3-4 months.

PATIENT M224
Okay that'd be fine.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
That'll be fine yes.

DOCTOR M224
And then next time I'll have my card with me and I'll give you my card but I can give you the number if you want.

PATIENT M224
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.  There's the phone number.

PATIENT M224
Excellent, alright.

DOCTOR M224
Alright and for your pain I'm going to set you up with PT again.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
Okay the Physical Therapy.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
And I want you to really try to take the tramadol as prescribed.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
I don't want to just throw medicine at you because medicines cause you know, they're not and they have other problems and so I don't want to keep just adding things to all of your pills.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
That you're already taking.

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
So if you can do your best to take the tramadol as prescribed and I'll get the physical therapy set up and then maybe they'll have some recommendations for you know stretches or treatment or something.

PATIENT M224
They've already done that twice, they come out to the house.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah and it looks like from what I could see when they came out to the house it was mostly to kind of evaluate for the scooter and that type of thing.

PATIENT M224
No I was, I had a stroke and heart attacks that's why they did it.

DOCTOR M224
Okay so they came out for that.

PATIENT M224
Now they assessed for the scooter right downstairs here.

DOCTOR M224
Yeah okay, okay.

PATIENT M224
Cause we only wanted a simple wheelchair but they wouldn't give me one.

DOCTOR M224
They wouldn't give you one yeah.  I think they thought it would have been too hard with all your cardiac issues I think they said.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
Um so we'll keep working on that okay.  

PATIENT M224
Right.

DOCTOR M224
We'll work on your pain.

PATIENT M224
Okay.

DOCTOR M224
And it'll kind of be what we talk about okay.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
And see what else we can do.

PATIENT M224
Alright.

DOCTOR M224
Okay.
