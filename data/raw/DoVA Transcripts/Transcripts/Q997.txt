DOCTOR Q997 
PATIENT?  Hi.  How you doing?

PATIENT Q997
Good.

DOCTOR Q997
Do you need that @@@.

PATIENT Q997
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q997
@@@.

PATIENT Q997
Oh I'm not sure, kind of like @@@.

DOCTOR Q997
Don't you think some @@@.

PATIENT Q997
@@@.  Um they did a MRI and a CAT scan and they say that the cyst hasn't came but whatever it was it's not back and that with my age and how much damage was done to my knees that they gonna wait a while before they give me a knee replacement.

DOCTOR Q997
Okay.  @@@

PATIENT Q997
They say that I'm not old enough and the damage is not enough right now.

DOCTOR Q997
Okay.  Are you able to get around and walk around?  There's no cane or anything I see.

PATIENT Q997
No there's no cane but.

DOCTOR Q997
You know you're gonna get in trouble wearing that.

PATIENT Q997
(Laughter)

DOCTOR Q997
(Laughter)  I'm not, I'm not I'm mean I'm from Texas so I'm not like a Bulls fan.

PATIENT Q997
But uh.  I got pain and I been getting, you know this here has never; it's real tender just to the touch.

DOCTOR Q997
You mean here?

PATIENT Q997
Yeah a lot of the pain is.

DOCTOR Q997
When was the MRI?  When did they do that?

PATIENT Q997
About six months ago and um but they were saying that it's not a tumor and they're not gonna do the operation that I needed to get the pain, get the pain therapy here.

DOCTOR Q997
Okay, okay.

PATIENT Q997
Because he's just a tumor specialist, he's not a regular doctor's appointment like here.

DOCTOR Q997
Okay and are you still taking the Naproxen medication?

PATIENT Q997
Uh do you know what the Naproxen don't do anything for me.

DOCTOR Q997
It doesn't do anything for you okay.

PATIENT Q997
Um I have um, I wanted to I got @@@ callus @@@, from the @@@ here.

DOCTOR Q997
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q997
And I had it removed here two or three times.  Do I have to get a consult to go to them?  And now my main reason for me coming here was because, see they put me on some new medications @@@ for my bipolar.

DOCTOR Q997
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q997
And the reason I had quit taking the medications before was because there it was messing with my sex.

DOCTOR Q997
Okay.  How’s the @@@ then?

PATIENT Q997
Huh?

DOCTOR Q997
@@@.

PATIENT Q997
Right.

DOCTOR Q997
What you're on now.

PATIENT Q997
It's starting to get to the point where like it was doing the same thing as the other stuff was doing.  So she told me to come in and see you all and you can give me something to help me with the sex instead of me stopping taking the medicines like I did before.  

DOCTOR Q997
You know I mean you're otherwise.

PATIENT Q997
And I, you know and during the period of time they told me that I probably needed to be clean and what not so I been clean for over six months.

DOCTOR Q997
Exactly what I was gonna say yeah.  Yeah so the last cocaine opiate positive urine drop you had was back in October and so it looks like you've been clean for about six months or so.

PATIENT Q997
Right.

DOCTOR Q997
Which is congratulations, excellent, great, absolutely great.  Um you know uh I'm looking at your medications.  There's really nothing on here that jumped out at me as something that would preclude us from starting you on a medication for erectile dysfunction if that's the issue that's going on.

PATIENT Q997
Okay.  

DOCTOR Q997
Um you know to be honest it's usually and the two most common reasons are medication induced and then like, I don't want to use terms like psychiatric but you know it's kind of like you know up in the head kind of thing.  

PATIENT Q997
When I stopped taking the medication that I was on before.

DOCTOR Q997
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q997
It came back on its own. 

DOCTOR Q997
That sounds about right and you know some of these medications obviously can have that effect so that's perfectly fine, it's not a problem.  Let's see here otherwise.  So I don't think we need to do an x-ray of the knee or anything since we just had that MRI done and it's still much more sensitive.  Um it sounds like you know the knee is fairly stable, if it's pain we need to address this issue.  And I’ll see about physical therapy as well.

PATIENT Q997
Right and you know every now and then I'll go take a step down and it'll catch you know and that be so much pain but other than that if I do a lot of walking then when I get home at night I have, when I try to go to sleep or relax I have @@@.

DOCTOR Q997
Okay.

PATIENT Q997
But as long as I don't do no bunch of walking, say if I go to the Mall with my wife or something then I be in trouble.  But other than that if I just you know cause I'm driving most of the time, I don't do much walking.  I don't have too much problem but when I do walking a lot that's when I have problems.

DOCTOR Q997
Well let's address the knee pain.  I can start you on a medication and see if that helps with the knee pain uh, get you hooked up with like a soft knee brace, that sort of thing like a Neoprene sleeve.  Just to kind of help out in terms of keeping it stable so that if it ever locks up or anything you don't like fall over.

PATIENT Q997
Right.

DOCTOR Q997
Or break something um and then also in addition I'd set you up with Physical Therapy.  Unfortunately, here there's I mean there's so many patients and so few physical therapy it usually takes about a month or so.

PATIENT Q997
No problem.

DOCTOR Q997
To get you in the clinic but uh but they honestly let you know about the date and time to come in for an initial evaluation.  For the callus we can get you set up with the podiatrist.

PATIENT Q997
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q997
The doctors that’s absolutely no problem.  Um the erectile dysfunction issues vardenafil is perfectly fine. @@@ medication. That’s not a problem.

PATIENT Q997
Okay.

DOCTOR Q997
Uh unfortunately through the VA there is a restriction uh you get two pills a month.

PATIENT Q997
Okay and then there's no problem, you know I got insurance so if I need more you can give me a prescription or I can go somewhere else and get it?

DOCTOR Q997
Um if you need to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

PATIENT Q997
But I'm gonna try it first and then I'll come back and see how it goes.

DOCTOR Q997
Uh and then the only other issue is I was going back, so you don't need to get a colonoscopy again until 2012.

PATIENT Q997
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q997
Uh still smoking?

PATIENT Q997
Yes.  I wished I, that's the next thing I'm gonna work on.  You know they say don't stop everything at once.

DOCTOR Q997
@@@.

PATIENT Q997
I got rid of the heroin and cocaine.

DOCTOR Q997
You've already done very well with that.

PATIENT Q997
Me and my wife are doing a lot better.  The family's doing better overall.

DOCTOR Q997
Good.  Okay.  Sounds like you've turned things around man that's.

PATIENT Q997
I'm just trying to be.

DOCTOR Q997
I'm impressed.

PATIENT Q997
Well, I got a beautiful family.  I've been with the same woman married 30 years.

DOCTOR Q997
Congratulations.

PATIENT Q997
And she never got high on anything, don't drink, don't smoke I don't even know how she stayed with me for 30 years.

DOCTOR Q997
Put up with you, don't question it.  I mean obviously there's a lot going on.  We'll, you know we can address as it comes.  If you want to you know even cutting down the amount that you smoke during the daytime.

PATIENT Q997
Well you know what.

DOCTOR Q997
I know that's its helpful and.

PATIENT Q997
I have cut down a little bit.  I used to smoke, I used to smoke over, you know I would buy a pack of cigarettes every day.  Now when I wake up in the morning I have seven, eight cigarettes left you know and so I've had to make a conscious effort to quit smoking and the only thing is I'm so used to smoking after I eat.

DOCTOR Q997
Yeah.

PATIENT Q997
I'm so used to smoking when I'm in the bathroom so now basically them the only times that I'm smoking.

DOCTOR Q997
Yeah.

PATIENT Q997
You know I done cut off everything else it's just those times I can't, after I eat I have to smoke.

DOCTOR Q997
Exactly and I @@@.

PATIENT Q997
And when I use the bathroom I have to smoke so basically there’s the only times I'm smoking you know.

DOCTOR Q997
And there's sort of a good push in terms of just the way that you know nicotine and the tobacco works in the mind and the way that you know we crave how regimented smoking is.

PATIENT Q997
And I been doing it for so long.

DOCTOR Q997
One of the best things to do and it sounds like you've done it already moving from a full pack to about a half pack a day.

PATIENT Q997
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q997
Is to think about like when you're smoking you know after meals, after using the restroom that sort of thing, you know take like maybe use the restroom after lunch.  Take that time to not use it at that time. And see how that does.

PATIENT Q997
Yeah but I can do that to the point where I done cut down.

DOCTOR Q997
Exactly.

PATIENT Q997
So you know because my wife don't smoke and right now another thing is I stopped smoking in the house so.

DOCTOR Q997
That's good then.

PATIENT Q997
That's another reason, I don't want to get up and go outside and smoke because I used to be able to just sit there and smoke now.

DOCTOR Q997
That's good cause I mean secondhand smoke is full of risk factors for lung disease for other people.

PATIENT Q997
And she's been on me for years about smoking in the house so I finally gave in and I don't smoke in the house and it's been helping me stop smoking so much.

DOCTOR Q997
Yeah enough so you have to go outside.

PATIENT Q997
Right.

DOCTOR Q997
Especially in the winter. 

PATIENT Q997
Right.

DOCTOR Q997
Um the only other thing that I wanted to do is just recheck your cholesterol for you know a cholesterol screen, mostly just a standard issue.  Um and then repeat a chem. panel which looks at your kidneys and your sugar, electrolytes, those sorts of things just for you know kidney disease, diabetes screening, that sort of thing.  Uh but that's just lab work that can be done any time either today or whenever, there's nothing urgent about it.

PATIENT Q997
Well if you give it to me while I'm here I might as well do it you know.

DOCTOR Q997
Uh let's see and then I think the only other thing that Jesse Brown wanted me to do for you, honestly at this point I'm not even worried about the vaccine.

PATIENT Q997
Well see, I don't know a lot of people say that, my wife, you know she's a nurse @@@ she say that you can't get sick when you take the flu shot but I took the flu shot three times and every time I got sick.

DOCTOR Q997
So you don't get the flu from the flu shot cause it's a killed virus.

PATIENT Q997
That's what my wife says.

DOCTOR Q997
If you get sick when you do get it because what is in the flu shot, a part of it immunizing your body against getting the real flu, it still has parts of a killed virus that act against your immune system.  You get an immune system response and what it is; you know when you have a sore throat from some viral illness.

PATIENT Q997
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q997
Or what have you the infection itself is actually for better or worse it's not what causes all those symptoms we get when we're sick, it's your body's immune system.

PATIENT Q997
Fighting it off.

DOCTOR Q997
Exactly and so it's sort of you to not die from a respiratory infection your body says to the system well you still feel like crap.

PATIENT Q997
Right.

DOCTOR Q997
You know and sort of a give and take and so what happens is yeah you get the injection and some people note kind of feeling like they have the flu afterwards and that just means you have a good immune system.  You don't actually have the flu.  You can't get other people sick.  That being said it's already April, I'm really glad for that.

PATIENT Q997
Well you know what.

DOCTOR Q997
If somebody has lung disease.

PATIENT Q997
Right and then my wife was saying the next flu season I'm gonna take it.

DOCTOR Q997
Exactly.

PATIENT Q997
And then.

DOCTOR Q997
Because around September, October when it comes out I'll push it.

PATIENT Q997
Because I got my grandkids living with me now and I don't want you know catch something from them or give them something you know.  I got two, my oldest daughter.

DOCTOR Q997
But we are gonna stick you today for um, the last time you had a tetanus shot, it looks like you just got a ten year booster.  You had it back in 2006.

PATIENT Q997
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q997
Um unfortunately I guess they went ahead and did just the tetanus diphtheria one.  Around 2006 they released the T-Dap, which is the tetanus/diphtheria, which is like lockjaw.

PATIENT Q997
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q997
Diphtheria, is a bad throat infection, in children more, and then what they added on was something called pertussis and whooping cough.

PATIENT Q997
I don't know about it.

DOCTOR Q997
Yeah and so anyone that got a tetanus diphtheria vaccine in 2006 and before have to repeat this just because it's a different vaccine.  So I had the same thing happen to me, I had to get two in two years.

PATIENT Q997
Okay.

DOCTOR Q997
I was a little upset about it but you know it's all to help out plus if you hang around any elderly people or children you know whooping cough affects them much worse than it does an adult.  

PATIENT Q997
I got a 4-year-old and a 7-year-old and as old as I am this is not something.

DOCTOR Q997
I know exactly.  So let me go talk to DOCTOR just to let him know what's going on and I'll come back in and let you know the plan and I think we can get you out of here okay.

PATIENT Q997
Okay no problem.

DOCTOR Q997
It'll be a couple minutes.

(DOCTOR OUT:  16:53   DOCTOR IN:  22:44)

DOCTOR Q997
DOCTOR is good with everything.  Let me find out who is available in terms of giving you this tetanus vaccine.

PATIENT Q997
Oh no problem.

DOCTOR Q997
Some people @@@, just hold on.  Apparently everyone's busy.  Um what I'll do is I'll put some of this stuff in the computer real quick.

PATIENT Q997
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q997
Um if you want to go over to the Lab and do the lab work and then come back that's perfectly fine or if you want to just like wait out there I'll let NAME know to call your name.

PATIENT Q997
Okay.

DOCTOR Q997
@@@.  And thanks so much for coming.

PATIENT Q997
Oh no problem.

DOCTOR Q997
I think we'll need to see you on a routine basis for a year but obviously if something comes up you can make an appointment.

PATIENT Q997
Let's try to make it in six months at least.

DOCTOR Q997
Okay yeah I can do it.  Um so the main thing is to go over to the Lab and get the lab work done over there.

PATIENT Q997
@@@.

DOCTOR Q997
So it'll be non-opiate medication just because you don't want to with the cocaine and the urine drops um so it'll be a medicine called @@@ I don't know if you've ever taken it before.  Um it's a little bit stronger than Naproxen but it's not as strong as like Vicodin so it's kind of a mix @@@.

PATIENT Q997
Okay.

DOCTOR Q997
@@@.

PATIENT Q997
@@@ they can tell that if Vicodin they can tell.

DOCTOR Q997
No, no, no, which I and @@@.  I don't want you to @@@.  Exactly.

PATIENT Q997
@@@.

DOCTOR Q997
@@@.  Physical Therapy will contact you.  If you want to, you can go up to the Prosthetics Office and you can pick up the knee brace.

PATIENT Q997
Oh you already put it in?

DOCTOR Q997
Um I'm gonna put everything in the computer right now uh it'll all be in @@@ and can be reached anywhere.

PATIENT Q997
Okay well I'm gonna go and get the blood work then.  Do I come back for the shot?

DOCTOR Q997
