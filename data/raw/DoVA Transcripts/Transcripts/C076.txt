Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR C076
PATIENT?

PATIENT C076
Uh I don't know.  Just wonder if you got a sharp needle or something?

DOCTOR C076
Huh?

PATIENT C076
(Laughs) Wouldn't know, no sharp needles.

DOCTOR C076
No not right now.  How you feeling?

PATIENT C076
I don't know.  I was looking forward to staying home.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
And all of a sudden I get a phone call to come in here.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.  Hmm.

PATIENT C076
Taking me off of that.

DOCTOR C076
You have a lot of medications.

PATIENT C076
Lisinopril and the other drug use.  

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
I don't know what the vitamin pills got to do with it but uh, feel a little better.

DOCTOR C076
Okay.  Uh do you understand why you're here today?

PATIENT C076
Pardon?

DOCTOR C076
Do you understand why you're here today?

PATIENT C076
I don't know anything.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
All they said was come.

DOCTOR C076
Okay.  Well you're here because DOCTOR, your primary care doctor um is worried about you because you are showing some problems of kidney disease, some pretty big problems with kidney disease okay.  

PATIENT C076
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

DOCTOR C076
Okay so, do you know what happens with kidney disease or like what?

PATIENT C076
Uh just usually transplants.

DOCTOR C076
Uh it can, I mean you're 81 so they're probably not gonna want to transplant you.  Um it usually only happens in people who are younger.  So things that happen is people get problems with their electrolytes like potassium and phosphorus, those get elevated.  Um your creatinine, we can test kidney function with the blood draw and it looks like you've just been getting worse on regular basis.  Let's see in the last year you've gotten quite a bit worse.  Why did you get your blood drawn on the 10th?  You saw DOCTOR back in November, okay.  We've got to decide what to do about your kidneys basically today.  So how much are you urinating?

PATIENT C076
When I have to that's about all.  I'm not going steady or anything like that.  Sometimes during the night maybe twice or three times.

DOCTOR C076
So you're urinating a normal amount then?

PATIENT C076
Yeah.

DOCTOR C076
Urination hasn't changed.

PATIENT C076
If anything eating less.

DOCTOR C076
You're urinating less?

PATIENT C076
Eating less.

DOCTOR C076
Oh okay.

PATIENT C076
There's so many limitations.  Who the hell knows?  Gas, lot of gas.

DOCTOR C076
Okay.  Um have you noticed any funny feelings with your heart or any decrease in your energy, anything else going on lately?

PATIENT C076
No the only thing that's been going on is that the calves and the feet you know hurt.  The calf is like if you over exercise and you get that burning sensation.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
That's what happens with the calves.

DOCTOR C076
How often does it happen?

PATIENT C076
And then uh takes a couple of days for it to go away.  I use a weight machine with the legs then it's two or two and a half days before I can really walk with ease.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
But that's and what you can do with that is don't exercise.

DOCTOR C076
(Laughter).

PATIENT C076
That uh but that's now those Sketchers, those shoes that they got that rocking motion to it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
They're not so good.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
I never buy another pair of those suckers.  It puts a strain on that muscle and then it hurts for a day or so.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
But besides that, there's nothing special.  Every time I get to the point where I feel like lifting some weights to get the strength back, something else goes wrong and I never get around to it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
But like I say since they took me off of that lisinopril and that other drug for gout.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
I'm feeling a little better.  I was going to start today lifting early in the morning and maybe late at night.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
But uh.

DOCTOR C076
We probably should repeat your blood draw um, you haven't had one.

PATIENT C076
I was last Saturday they, uh last Friday.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
I was here and they took blood and test it.

DOCTOR C076
Right, right, right.  It was bad so we've got to make sure to see, cause your potassium was really elevated and your kidneys, your kidney numbers were elevated.  So what we need to do is check it again and if you can, we should probably do a UA.

PATIENT C076
Well they were supposed to draw blood today.

DOCTOR C076
Were they?

PATIENT C076
It's what I was told over the phone.  Of course there's nothing in stone but uh.

DOCTOR C076
So we'll draw blood today.

PATIENT C076
It's that damn needles.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
Besides that uh I don't know, you're the doctor.

DOCTOR C076
Right.

PATIENT C076
I'll walk in through those pearly doors on there, I figure somebody's got to do some cut and sew.

DOCTOR C076
Okay but otherwise you're in your normal state of health.  Are you feeling more tired?  Are you having difficulty, you have to use a walker to get around, is it harder to get around than normal?

PATIENT C076
Well, I would say it's a little better.  Uh I walked from the back of the building all the way to the front and took the elevator.  Usually the legs would bother me.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Today it didn't so it must have had something to do with the lisinopril and the vitamin pill and whatever that other one, 0.3 I was on.

DOCTOR C076
Let's see if we can get your blood drawn right now.  Let me, you sit here and sit tight for just a second.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT C076
Yeah.

(DOCTOR OUT:  28:14  DOCTOR IN:  30:27)

DOCTOR C076
Alright.  Tell me how to pronounce your name again.  PATIENT?

PATIENT C076
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR C076
Okay, let's go get your blood drawn.

PATIENT C076
(Laughs) Oh thank you very much.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Just what I wanted to do all my life.

DOCTOR C076
But we want to make sure you're okay.  Were you dehydrated last week?  Do you drink less water or?

PATIENT C076
I don't know, I drink when I'm thirsty that's all.

DOCTOR C076
But otherwise you weren't having any diarrhea, nausea, vomiting last week?

PATIENT C076
I wasn't vomiting no, no diarrhea.

DOCTOR C076
Nothing?

PATIENT C076
Uh but I got a lot of gas, go to the toilet quite often there because of the.

DOCTOR C076
How often were you going?

PATIENT C076
Yeah a little diarrhea from the pills but not from uh anything else.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh, okay.  (Doctor talking to someone about ordering labs).  Okay so he'll send you back to my room when you're done okay.

PATIENT C076
Oh gee thanks.

DOCTOR C076
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  31:55  DOCTOR IN:  42:58)

PATIENT C076
Oh.

DOCTOR C076
Did he get you?

PATIENT C076
Yeah.

DOCTOR C076
We need to see what the results of those are before I can send you home and they need to, if you're potassium is high we'll probably have to give you something to bring down the potassium and if you're.

PATIENT C076
Potassium, oh I some damn bananas.

DOCTOR C076
You've been eating a lot of bananas?

PATIENT C076
I have one every morning.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Not today because I was going to go the @@@ today.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
But usually every morning have one with bran flakes, milk and a banana as breakfast.

DOCTOR C076
Oh good.  I'm gonna go ahead and take a listen to you real quick.  I think it'll take a second for those labs to come back.  Could you take off your jacket and unbuckle your trousers sir.

PATIENT C076
Oh my goodness gracious.

DOCTOR C076
(Laughter) What did you used to do for a living?

PATIENT C076
Mold maker.

DOCTOR C076
Huh?

PATIENT C076
Mold maker.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.  In @@@?

PATIENT C076
That's the last.

DOCTOR C076
Have you been to the Loop?

PATIENT C076
But I uh, no I had a bunch and I worked construction in Dallas, Texas.

DOCTOR C076
Oh really?

PATIENT C076
In uh.

DOCTOR C076
Alright take some deep breaths in and out.  Okay good.  I'm from Oklahoma City and that's really close to Dallas.

PATIENT C076
Yeah, I worked in a foundry; I've done a number of things.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And then I went to war.

DOCTOR C076
Which war?

PATIENT C076
Korea.  My cousin and I went to war.  With the frozen chosen.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.  How long were you there?

PATIENT C076
Too long.  40 below zero, too damn long.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah, sounds pretty awful.

PATIENT C076
Well that's the, that's right on the Manchurian border.  In Manchuria there is nothing.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
There's a desert, couple of deserts, no trees, no nothing.

DOCTOR C076
Wow nothing.

PATIENT C076
And uh the wind, there's nothing to slow it down.  But it gets cold out there.

DOCTOR C076
I'm sure it does.

PATIENT C076
That's all there is to it.  And we had General McArthur, our hero.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
Yeah he was a real idiot.

DOCTOR C076
(Laughter) I'll have you stand.

PATIENT C076
He had no idea what was gonna run into.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.  

PATIENT C076
They were, well you know the GIs had uniforms that were in Germany, for Germany where it gets uh 10 below zero maybe two days out of the year.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
That stuff was alright but.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Not in Manchuria cause that was where the Japanese armies ran into Sukoff and his Russians.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And the civilians were, knew how to live in that cold. 

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
They wiped out the Japanese twice.  The Aleutian Islands that was where you know damp and cold and stuff like that where they had a lot of trouble.  They should have known better.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
But no one even knew where Korea was.  Nobody.  No idea what the hell was.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Cause you're too young, I said this is it, you know.  Oh my goodness.  

DOCTOR C076
Think your labs are back yet.

PATIENT C076
Yeah, it's just; I went into some of them towns there.  They were the big towns.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
The large ones.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
Had a bank and a brewery and them damn Chinese.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Blew up the brewery.  Why would you want to destroy a brewery?

DOCTOR C076
That's true.  Why would you want to do that? Good point?  What else you got planned today?

PATIENT C076
They didn't give a damn about the bank.  There was a gunner at 146th Bank, had a 90 mm gun on that.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
So I pulled up to the bank there and if the door wasn't open I was going to blow it.

DOCTOR C076
Oh.

PATIENT C076
The money wasn't any good, the paper stuff.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
But we thought maybe they'd have some gold or something in there.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Nothing.  We come out to that town.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Yawing Village you can't, they had @@@ to ground.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Then they had that rice straw that they put on the walls and the roof, like the Irish stuff that they use for roofing and you could tell it was a concussion to knock it down because every damn house was just leaning the other way.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
We looked at it and uh we could of went in to see if there was anything worthwhile but who'd want to run into dead people so we never even looked.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
I felt sorry for some of those people's lives.  Sorry for them, sorry for the American soldiers to where they were so scared.

DOCTOR C076
I bet.

PATIENT C076
They were shooting the civilians.

DOCTOR C076
Oh my gosh, that's horrible.

PATIENT C076
Yeah it was.  It's nothing new, it happens but.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah, it doesn't sound very good.

PATIENT C076
It was because these guys were so, when the North Koreans retreated they didn't take any prisoners with them, they killed all they had.

DOCTOR C076
Oh that's just awful.

PATIENT C076
Well that's war, its hell.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
You looking to surrender for, they didn't believe in it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
The poor guys didn't have very much to eat for themselves, let alone feed you.

DOCTOR C076
Did you do anything after Korea with the military?

PATIENT C076
No, no, that's, that was, they had me long enough.  It's with, what the hell, with the guy says when they were inducted, $98 a month, I was an ambassador, but it wasn't much of an ambassador.  For $98 a month.  Cause that was the good news, @@@ some guy stood up and asked a captain that was there, how long did it take for him to make rank.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
He said all you have to do is live long enough.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
He didn't.

DOCTOR C076
Wow.  Do you ever talk to the guys that you met with again?

PATIENT C076
They're dead.

DOCTOR C076
Really?

PATIENT C076
All of them.  None of the guys that I went into the Army from the town.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Uh well they died of old age and whatever and I was uh on the 300 line and I got talking to one of the friends.  Oh hell he was 200 yards down the line and we never met.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Because nobody ever went anywhere there.  You know you couldn't leave your tank.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Because @@@ put it and people were shooting all over you know, so you never went anywhere to find out if the guys were there then after it was all over then you got to talking and yeah, he was down there just a couple hundred yards away.  Some guys were that I trained with.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Some made it and some didn't, that was all.  Three of them stayed an extra month to make another locker for the sergeant first class.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
They were gonna stay in the Army.  They didn't make it; all three of them got killed.  The first sergeant was tied to a tree and frozen to death, stripped him naked and tied him and left him there.  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR C076
He was one of your, an American soldier?

PATIENT C076
No they were the Chinese, North Korean.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
He was captured on patrol and they don't believe in keeping prisoners.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
See they had the uniforms were, well they were grey.  They were treated or padded like you know they had the cross sewing in there, little bumps.  They were winter uniforms and they were cotton.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
As long as their weather was cold and they didn't get wet.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
It was pretty good and the uniform worked but once they got wet.

DOCTOR C076
You were done with huh.

PATIENT C076
Every once in a while you'd see a couple of Chinese soldiers come walking out of the line there, they'd come walking towards our lines.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
To surrender yeah.  Yeah but it didn't do them much good because the American Army didn't understand what was going on over there and uh an island they called Kogi.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Originally it was, when they had the Korean emperor was overthrown, they put him on this island.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Cause there were sharks all over the damn thing and you couldn't get off of it.  They didn't have to spend money guarding anybody.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
So they'd throw them on there, give them some food and he can do what he wants.  Well they made that into a prison camp for Chinese.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And they had and General D was in command of that prison camp and he walked into the compound and the Chinese soldiers in the compound captured him.

DOCTOR C076
Oh my gosh, how horrible.

PATIENT C076
Well they, all they wanted was more gasoline to cook their food with and some uh some privilege things.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
But uh the Army isn't gonna give in so we were on the front lines in the north.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
So they pulled the tank division off of that front.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And guys from the second division I was in the 3rd Mechanized Army.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And they uh surrounded this compound and then when we got there all we did was, we're tired so we laid down on the ground or on the tank and just fell asleep there and all of a sudden realized that these Chinese that we had captured, what they were facing wasn't this crummy Airborne Division and Korean Army they had, these guys meant business so they finally gave up.  You know that truck, the size of it is only about 4 foot high.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
We’d would string barbed wire over that thing and load the prisoners on there and we'd tear gas in there and then when they stood up, they stood up into the barbed wire.

DOCTOR C076
Wow.

PATIENT C076
Oh we weren't any kinder than anybody else but they had tanks and you had a platform like where the bunks were.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And down because there was no drainage so there was always water in there when it rained.

DOCTOR C076
Just a second.

PATIENT C076
So they took a.

(Doctor made a phone call)

DOCTOR C076
They have your blood they just haven't done it yet.  So go ahead.

PATIENT C076
They had bulldozers and they were gonna flatten all that land off.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And when they started in over there and they took down these humps they found bodies in there.  The Chinese were holding court martial.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
With the law against their own people and hanging them and burying them underneath where they slept.  That there, that's just, was an ongoing thing.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Whether you surrendered or got there, the odds were you're not gonna make it.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.  Did you have any family that was in the military?

PATIENT C076
Well they were @@@ cousins over in Turkey in the Air Force.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And like I said my cousin and I were in Korea uh it's, we were just the right age.  You know too young for W2 and just right for.

DOCTOR C076
@@@.

PATIENT C076
Oh yeah, it's an experience.

DOCTOR C076
Not a good one.  I guess you got to see a different part of the world and that might have been nice.

PATIENT C076
Well we really weren’t an ambassador, that was for damn sure and the food wasn't very good.

DOCTOR C076
No it wasn't.

PATIENT C076
There's some stuff I ate I still don't know what the hell it was.

DOCTOR C076
(Laughter).  Let's see.  I'm so sad that you guys don't have to go over there.  Those guys in Afghanistan now, you've just got to wonder what it's for, you know.

PATIENT C076
Yeah well war is war all over and it's always the same.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.  Some bureaucrat that wants something done and the poor people in the middle get stuck.  It has nothing to do with you or me you know.

PATIENT C076
Well you feel sorry for the women and children there because uh.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
You know and every mother cries after her baby dies and it's uh not a nice thing but.

DOCTOR C076
No it’s not.

PATIENT C076
As far, but there it was like we had a 20 mile dead zone.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
From the front line back where there wasn't any civilians so we didn't …, if you were in that 20 mile zone there you know you don't worry about anybody.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Cause there was nobody there.  Once in a while the.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
They in the springtime when the tide was running high in the rivers there they'd float down on rafts to get away from the Red Chinese.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And we'd bring them ashore, feed them, put them on trucks and send them to Seoul and let the Korean government take care of them.  Cause Korea was, Seoul was a big city.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.  What do you think about Kim Jong Ill dying?

PATIENT C076
You look at it now and the apartment buildings and the high rises and then it was paper shacks and uh iron, corrugated iron and stuff like that.  It wasn't the, the only building there was was on a hill was an orphanage.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And both the American Army and the Chinese never touched it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Cause they respected the sisters that were in there.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
But uh, but that was the only place, the only place.  It was at En Shan when McArthur landed in that place there.  He was the luckiest guy in the world.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Cause that's, those big blocks of cement you got in Montrose Harbor and stuff like that.  That En Shan Harbor is built with these big stones, rectangular cement blocks, at least you'd have to be 50 feet high.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And the En Shan Harbor and some was a shallow harbor was made for small junks to carry uh things in.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And even the larger junks couldn’t come in to the harbor because uh there was not enough water underneath it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
So he just headed right cause the North Koreans believed that you couldn't land there so they never reinforced it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
So they had a cake walk in.  But it was a son-of-a-gun.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
I don't ever want to go back there.  A couple of machine guns sitting on the top and they could've wiped out the whole Army.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah crazy.

PATIENT C076
Yeah McArthur had no idea what was happening.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Cause when the Chinese came down, they were volunteers, they were volunteers hell.  Then there was a Joe Stillwell who was a ranger general.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Trained, I don't know how many divisions of Chinese troops and armed them.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And Mao Tse Tung, you couldn't kill these guys because there were so many of them and there would have been an uprising if you tried it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
So along comes the Korean War so what the hell, he orders these guys to go in and they're really, you know wiped most of them out, he got rid of them anyway.  He was so afraid that they were American thought the regime wouldn’t stand up.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And he had to get rid of them and didn't know how until the Korean War came along.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
Yeah a lot of Chinese died in that war.  

DOCTOR C076
Wow.

PATIENT C076
Cause they were using napalm.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
And yeah, oh God that stuff is brutal.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
Yeah, what else, I was in the tank and then I was in the library after I came back and they had a book on armor.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
So I thought what the hell I'll look up and see how they rated that damn tank I was in.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
So I look through the book and damn it I couldn't find it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And then I went through it a couple of times and then I found a paragraph.  The reason why we were having so much trouble with the stupid thing was it was an experimental job.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
And they built it and didn't know what to do with it, so they shipped it over there and we used it to fight the Chinese.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
Had a beautiful gun on it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
90 mm, beautiful, copy of the German 88 but uh the rest of it broke down all the time.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
Sometimes they couldn't pull it up a hill they had to back it up.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
They used it as a, just drive it up there, dig a hole with just the turret sticking up and.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
Have fun.

DOCTOR C076
How long were you there, oh no you were there for a while huh?

PATIENT C076
Well I was there for over a year.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh and you never went home in between, you were just there continuously for a year?

PATIENT C076
Oh hell, I only had a shower three times in a year.

DOCTOR C076
Oh.

PATIENT C076
One every couple three months, they'd come by and set up a portable shower.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
Never wore any rank because uh the uniforms they just threw on a pile and burned.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
Lice and fleas and what the hell.  At night the little furry animals come and snuggle up close to you, they want to be warm too in the wintertime.

DOCTOR C076
Was it ever warm there or just always cold?

PATIENT C076
In the summer it's hotter than hell.

DOCTOR C076
Oh really.

PATIENT C076
And dry and dusty.  In spring its rain and there's no drainage.  Everything is filled with water.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
In the fall it snowed.  The first snow hit the ground and from then on it just piled up.

DOCTOR C076
Man.

PATIENT C076
Pleasant, you got used to it.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
Yeah most of the time you had problems it was with the troops.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
I don't know where the hell I was, I came back.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And the master sergeant said okay you're gonna stay in this tent with these two guys and you'll have a warm bed tonight.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
I said now that's nice, cause I always looked forward to a warm bed.  So I'm coming back from chow.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And here comes some guy from the, some corporal from the CPs and says sergeant, sergeant, get your tanks ready to move out, you're moving out at midnight.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
I go well that was nice I had four hours of sleep.  We pulled into some place and you got five tanks in a platoon.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Two of them, four and five to one side and this lieutenant would take the other and I was a section sergeant.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
So I had two, so they tell us take your bunks with you, your sleeping bags and I put it down on the ground, it was just, so everything was still frozen.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
And we’re had a shelter tent that standard infantry and I put that over that sucker and took my boots off and put it under the pillow and I'm falling asleep and here, darker than hell, it was cloudy, rainy and at the time it wasn't raining when I went to bed but it did later on.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And I never woke up.  The shelter was water-proofed, water ran off and I was dry, I didn't give a damn.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
But I hear this damn commotion.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And I said what the hell is going on, I can't leave the tank because it's mine, I signed for the damn thing, I can't leave it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
So at last dawn comes and I see all these guys with flashlights looking and I find out when I go there's a tank that had rain during the night.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
There was where the officers had made for their tents and stuff.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
There was uh low ground and they had taken off their boots and put their boots next to the bed like they were Cinderella or some damn thing and a fairy godmother was going to come with candy and put them in the boots.  Well it so happened that it rained enough that the boots all floated to the center of this compound.

DOCTOR C076
Crazy.

PATIENT C076
And they got running around looking for their boots in their bare feet on the muddy ground.

DOCTOR C076
Hmm.

PATIENT C076
They should of known better, these guys didn't know what the hell they were doing cause we had some new young guys come in from the states.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
And they never were in this situation.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Because I put it right underneath my head, you aren't going far with my boots.  So the first thing you did is you'd have to put them on because it's cold out there.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
So it took them, I don't know a couple three hours before they got everything sorted out.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh, wow.

PATIENT C076
Yeah that's funny, kind of funny, it's crazy that's all.  Yeah that ground was frozen so hard.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
If a mortar shell came in and hit, all it did was blow the snow away.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
The ground was so hard that it didn't even penetrate, it just laid whatever it was, just blew the top of it away and that was it.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
You could go over there and pick up the fuse.

DOCTOR C076
Wow.

PATIENT C076
And you're digging a damn 46-ton tank with a pickaxe and an axe and one guy on the shovel, I mean that was work.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
You could bury that tank up to the turret and my goodness gracious, never again.  Yeah, had a guy, NAME.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
Tennessee.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076

DOCTOR C076
Wow.

PATIENT C076
He's bitchin that he had to wear that steel helmet that it made him bald.  He took that helmet off and he was like an old man, all he had was hair at the side and he blamed it on the captain and the lieutenant and the steel pot.

DOCTOR C076
Gosh.

PATIENT C076
Oh boy.  It was funny.

DOCTOR C076
Yeah.

PATIENT C076
And I mean we were always armed.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
We always carried a gun with live ammunition.

DOCTOR C076
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C076
That's the way it is oh, so they were some of the new officers scared shitless for crying out loud, the guy was going crazy.  Yeah just like an old man, just a little hair at the side that was it.  I didn't realize it and I mean, you know, cause we always was wearing that thing and never took it off.

DOCTOR C076
