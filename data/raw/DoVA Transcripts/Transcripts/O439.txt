DOCTOR O439
Oh okay.  Is that it?  

PATIENT O439
Thank you.

DOCTOR O439
Alright, so how's things been?

PATIENT O439
Well I feel much better than I've felt in a long time.

DOCTOR O439
Good.

PATIENT O439
@@@.

DOCTOR O439
Very good.

PATIENT O439
I felt bad all summer you know.

DOCTOR O439
Alright, right.

PATIENT O439
You know so.

DOCTOR O439
You're doing better now.

PATIENT O439
Yeah I'm feeling better.  I mean I still you know get lightheaded after I walk for about a mile and a half.

DOCTOR O439
Oh okay.

PATIENT O439
I mean, I don't know if it's lightheaded or wobbly or whatever but and uh I still have that left eye feels like something is pushing out of it but you know I don't know that is swelling or getting dry or something.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
I've had all that checked and they can't find anything at all.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
You know he looked in my ears.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah.

PATIENT O439
A couple of weeks ago.

DOCTOR O439
Good.

PATIENT O439
And there was an irritation in there but they didn't.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
They didn't, I mean when they touched it, it was uh, there was a little spot that was real sore but they didn't make anything of it or anything.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Alright, you're gonna go back and see the neurology doctors it looks like.

PATIENT O439
I cancelled that because it's like I mean, they just, I mean it's just the same thing over and over so I'm just so I cancelled that and I cancelled my, I had a rheumatology because my arms and everything was shaking but.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
Uh since I've started doing yoga it feels better.

DOCTOR O439
Good.

PATIENT O439
And there are certain things I have been doing to exercise with my arms so I just think that maybe that was part of it.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
And uh my, the quick burst of headaches that I was having.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah.

PATIENT O439
They are gone away, for the most part.  Every now and then I might have a quick burst but.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
It's gone you know.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
The only thing that's really bothering me now is for some reason I get pain down in my lower abdomen.  

DOCTOR O439
@@@.

PATIENT O439
I'd say my bladder but I don't know what it is like to my right side and then down to my abdomen so.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
Sometimes and that doesn't happen all the time but when it does it's just kind of quick and intense.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
And one time it did stop me from moving for a while after I used the washroom I couldn't move.

DOCTOR O439
I see.

PATIENT O439
So but that's, you know that's it.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  So it's uh, okay when was the last time you had it?

PATIENT O439
Uh actually it feels sore now.  It happens a few times a week.  I don't know.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
But the first time that it happened was about a month ago I think and I'd used the washroom, I was out and I used the washroom and I went to, I walked out of the washroom and a pain hit me and I could not move.  I had to stand there for a while so.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
And then it you know it just uh comes and it goes.  It's nothing, I've noticed no blood.  There's no discoloration of my urine, it's a light yellow and.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
You know, so I don't know if maybe I'm holding my urine too long or.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Um is there any burning when you urinate?

PATIENT O439
No there's no burning.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
@@@.

DOCTOR O439
Are you urinating more frequently than normal?

PATIENT O439
No.  I mean if I drink more water I will.

DOCTOR O439
Right, right, yeah.

PATIENT O439
But you know, but no.

DOCTOR O439
Um okay, um so this belly pain, it's on the, starts up on the right side and then.

PATIENT O439
It's right here, it's almost like, it's right, it's right here on my left side and I've had problems with this on and off, this side here.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah.

PATIENT O439
And then look and this is where it really hurts.

DOCTOR O439
It hurts down there.

PATIENT O439
Down underneath my bladder like.

DOCTOR O439
When did that start?

PATIENT O439
Um the first episode I had was about, see I don't know if I had been having slight pains before when I had that bladder infection or whatever infection I had but I don't recall it so it must not have been that significant.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
But when I, about a month ago, when I used the washroom and then I went out and I went to walk and it's, after I washed my hands I stepped out the washroom and wow that pain hit me, so I said wow. 

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
It was sharp and intense.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
So and.

DOCTOR O439
Okay, just when you were using the restroom?

PATIENT O439
Yeah, but that time but it comes like if I'm sitting down.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah.

PATIENT O439
Or something and I get up, I might feel it or something so.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
Cause actually I feel it right now in my left side but it's, it's not like intense, it's just you know.

DOCTOR O439
Okay and is it just at the time when you're urinating or is it just like when you're like sitting down or?

PATIENT O439
Well sometimes I'm, it seems to like it's more like when I'm sitting down and I get up or something.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
Um.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
You know but, you know it's, you know but it's, it doesn't come that.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
You know it comes but it's not like regular or all the time or constant I should say.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
But uh and the only other thing I wanted to mention is I got these little white moles coming in my face now, in the last couple of months.

DOCTOR O439
Moles you're saying?

PATIENT O439
Yeah there's one, it's real hard too.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah I see it.

PATIENT O439
And then I was looking, I thought this was a crumb or something.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah, I see.

PATIENT O439
And I kept wiping it.

DOCTOR O439
And it doesn't wipe off.

PATIENT O439
Right and then I tried to you know burst it but it won't.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
It's really hard.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
And I say what the heck is that now?

DOCTOR O439
Like what's going on yeah.

PATIENT O439
Yeah and those just appeared, this one just appeared, the one by my mouth just appeared about a month ago.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
And the other one was maybe two or three months ago.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT O439
So I know you get old all kinds of things start popping out so.

DOCTOR O439
Sounds good right.  Let me see, if you brought @@@ the last time.  @@@

PATIENT O439
Yeah that's, that's getting better.

DOCTOR O439
Oh yeah.

PATIENT O439
That's getting better I had uh.

DOCTOR O439
@@@?

PATIENT O439
Yeah but, thank God that part is over.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
And it seems like my face is getting better on this side so it may have had something to do with my root canal.  Every now and then I get a little numbness.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
Uh and I do have another tooth over there that they got to work on but.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
But I'm trying to put that off as long as I can.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  I got it.

PATIENT O439
You know I broke my bridge so that's number one now, I gotta get that fixed.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
I'm getting an implant and uh.

DOCTOR O439
Oh okay.

PATIENT O439
It's probably before, I had a bridge here and the front tooth is gone.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
So I'm gonna get an implant there.  Let me stop talking so you can look up whatever.

DOCTOR O439
Oh no, I'm just taking a look see if it's uh, cause I know you back in August you saw the GI doctors.

PATIENT O439
Yeah.

DOCTOR O439
Other than that, it looks really good.  Okay you still taking the omeprazole?  The acid blocker?

PATIENT O439
No I don't take any of that anymore.  

DOCTOR O439
You aren't.

PATIENT O439
I stopped taking that man.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT O439
A long time ago, I quit you know.  I don't want to get caught up in it, you know I just try to not eat late and not go to bed.

DOCTOR O439
Good.

PATIENT O439
On a full stomach and stuff that I can do to kind of help it you know.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
And so for the most part that's okay.  Every now and then I might eat something that makes me a little bit nauseated but.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
Other than that you know but.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Now when's the last time you've seen the Women's Health?  Do you go see them?

PATIENT O439
I haven't been up there ever since last year but it is coming up.

DOCTOR O439
About that time yeah.

PATIENT O439
Time for me to order uh, for them to order a mammogram.

DOCTOR O439
Yes exactly.  I can put that in.

PATIENT O439
Probably takes a long time to get that appointment maybe like two months or something.

DOCTOR O439
Right.  Correct.

PATIENT O439
I mean to get the mammogram set-up; it takes a long time cause I go to the University of Illinois.  They don't do them here.

DOCTOR O439
Oh okay you go over there to U of I.

PATIENT O439
Yeah.

DOCTOR O439
Okay, do you see Women's Health here or do you go?

PATIENT O439
Yes but I have to see Women's Health here.

DOCTOR O439
Got it.

PATIENT O439
And then they refer me to the U of I.

DOCTOR O439
Got it, okay.

PATIENT O439
Cause they just started doing the mammograms.

DOCTOR O439
Alright, okay uh alright, @@@ files here.  Your blood testing looks great.  You started yoga which is awesome.

PATIENT O439
Uh-huh, yeah, I do that pretty often.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
You know doctor uh my blood pressure, I know that its, people always tell me the blood pressure's great but it's kind of sporadic to me and I don't know what that's about.  Like I, when I went to get my implant.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah.

PATIENT O439
They examine for that, do you want me to take this off?

DOCTOR O439
Yes please.

PATIENT O439
Okay, when I went to get that examined uh he, my blood pressure was like 106/88, which is a weird number.

DOCTOR O439
Right, um.

PATIENT O439
88 that 88 being so high like that.

DOCTOR O439
So that's, okay.  You know the thing is there's a pretty wide variation in blood pressure cuffs and blood pressures so honestly like.

PATIENT O439
Yeah.

DOCTOR O439
We do it.

PATIENT O439
Maybe something was wrong with their cuff, cause that's weird.

DOCTOR O439
The only time we get excited about blood pressure being too high is when you're consistently elevated for like multiple readings over like the course of a month.

PATIENT O439
Oh okay.

DOCTOR O439
Okay, so I mean if you had an isolated reading that's high, it could just be the cuff.

PATIENT O439
You said cuff?

DOCTOR O439
Sorry a blood pressure cuff.

PATIENT O439
Oh I'm sorry.  Don’t I'm think I'm not happy I'm not taking blood pressure medicine.

DOCTOR O439
Right, right.

PATIENT O439
Cause cholesterol is bad enough.

DOCTOR O439
Deep breaths in and out.  And again.  And again.  And again.  Go ahead and lie back for me.  So belly pain comes off and on, usually when you're in the washroom sitting down.

PATIENT O439
Well not necessarily in the washroom sitting down but when I'm sitting, like if I'm in the living room sitting and I get up.

DOCTOR O439
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O439
I can feel it down here.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah.

PATIENT O439
And it's on the right side, it's not, the left side somewhat but it's on the right and right here, just a little bit.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
But I said man there must be a line or something going from here to here.

DOCTOR O439
Alright.

PATIENT O439
Causing that cause now it's more to the right.  I didn't say I didn't mean the left; it's more to the right than it is to the left.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Can you go ahead and just pull your shirt up a little bit just so I can see your skin.  Any relationship to food whatsoever?  Meals.

PATIENT O439
No I haven't noticed any of that.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
That's a little tender.

DOCTOR O439
Okay, got it, okay.  @@@ down there?

PATIENT O439
No.

DOCTOR O439
A little painful there now?

PATIENT O439
It's a little.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Any tenderness over here?

PATIENT O439
No.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Just a little bit in there @@@.  This one here at all?

PATIENT O439
No.

DOCTOR O439
Any problems with diarrhea?

PATIENT O439
No.

DOCTOR O439
Blood in you - so are you just ticklish or painful?

PATIENT O439
Painful.

DOCTOR O439
Over here.

PATIENT O439
When you press on it right here.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
Sometimes I feel like a pressure like at my naval, under my naval.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Alright.  No problems with bowel movements?

PATIENT O439
No.

DOCTOR O439
Fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting or anything like that?

PATIENT O439
No I'm just hot and cold all the time, that's.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
That's hormones things.

DOCTOR O439
Right, got it.  

PATIENT O439
And I'm doing my exercises and even if I get tired I keep going.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
And I'm trying to mix it up, you know I'm trying real hard to lose weight but @@@.

DOCTOR O439
Right.  

PATIENT O439
But I'm trying to eat @@@.  I'm you know making fruit smoothies and stuff.  

DOCTOR O439
Have you ever had your gallbladder out?

PATIENT O439
@@@.

DOCTOR O439
Have you ever had your gallbladder removed?

PATIENT O439
Um no, no.

DOCTOR O439
When you had that uh the aneurysm in your aorta.

PATIENT O439
I still do.

DOCTOR O439
Okay, you had uh a mesh placed or a repair?

PATIENT O439
No, it's not @@@.

DOCTOR O439
None of the above, we just were watching it.

PATIENT O439
Right.

DOCTOR O439
Alright.

PATIENT O439
The last time they it was three months ago in April.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
I think they said they want to do another one in six months.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah.

PATIENT O439
After that but I, @@@.

DOCTOR O439
@@@.

PATIENT O439
Pardon.

DOCTOR O439
Are you having any back pain?

PATIENT O439
Uh just lower back but I attribute that to uh right along in here, I attribute that to my yoga poses.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
Cause what I do is I do uh twists.

DOCTOR O439
Lean forward @@@.

PATIENT O439
No I do twists; you know I do twists where I'm twisting by contorting my body.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
And they said it was okay to keep doing all that stuff.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  

PATIENT O439
I mean I'm twisting my upper torso one way and the lower part of my body the other way trying to exercise my spine.

DOCTOR O439
Right.  Right.

PATIENT O439
And so then after I do that and then some of the uh the standing yoga poses where you, forget the name of the one, it's a common one where you stand with your legs opened and your knees slightly bent and you @@@ backwards, slightly backward stance.

DOCTOR O439
Oh yeah, I'm not sure the name of it either.

PATIENT O439
I forget the name of it, God I can't believe I forget the name of it.

DOCTOR O439
I don't know.

PATIENT O439
Um you know it hurts a little bit and I have to uh do something to loosen it up.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah.  Okay.  I'm just trying to figure out if we should get that CAT scan.  They wanted to do that repeat CAT scan uh to keep an eye on that aorta uh but I don't think that we.  You know now that you're having pain, you might want to get that, get it repeated a little sooner because we'll see uh.  

PATIENT O439
No I just assumed that if I had a problem with the aorta that my back would be, I would have sharp intense pains in the upper part of my back.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah.  That’s normally how it presents @@@ back @@@, you're absolutely right.  It's kind of atypical.  Um do you think you strained a muscle or something doing the yoga?  Is that possible?

PATIENT O439
No I can tell when I strain a muscle.

DOCTOR O439
It's not like that?

PATIENT O439
No it's not, it's not a muscle strain and I wondered I said man am I passing uh, the calcium that comes in there, cause I was taking so much calcium but I decided to ease up off of that calcium and actually I've been lax with taking my vitamins.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
But I eased off the calcium cause I said man I'm taking all this stuff and uh there was a study that was on the news where they say calcium really doesn't do that much good and I'm saying, you know the calcium pills.

DOCTOR O439
Right @@@.

PATIENT O439
I'm saying oh my goodness.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
For 40 years I been taking calcium and it's not doing any good.

DOCTOR O439
Right.  Well let me take a look see here.  So it looks like you have good kidney function.

PATIENT O439
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O439
So that's a good thing.  Uh.

PATIENT O439
Probably another thing something I want to make sure that my uh, I'm having problems getting my cholesterol medication because the last time it was just, the prescription was renewed for just 30 days.

DOCTOR O439
Oh okay.  So you need a longer prescription on it.

PATIENT O439
Yeah cause at the Women's Clinic they initially renewed it every 90 days but then I would go in and get my blood checked every six months.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
So they just would give me a 90 day supply.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
And it was uh where you can get three or four refills.

DOCTOR O439
Right okay, yeah I can put that in for that for you.  You do not feel like it's a urinary tract infection correct?  But you had one of those before?

PATIENT O439
Yeah they said I had one this summer.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
They said that was probably one of the reasons I was feeling bad.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
Cause I felt bad all summer.

DOCTOR O439
Let's uh go ahead and get another urine sample from you today.  Um.

PATIENT O439
Do you know if Lipitor is better than the statin?  Is Lipitor a statin?

DOCTOR O439
Yeah, it sure is.

PATIENT O439
Somebody told me that uh the Lipitor doesn't cause the muscle problems.

DOCTOR O439
Oh yeah.

PATIENT O439
Or something that the side effects is not as bad with Lipitor as with uh Zocor.

DOCTOR O439
Oh, @@@ yeah.

PATIENT O439
Have you had that or anything?

DOCTOR O439
Uh you're talking about the muscle problems?

PATIENT O439
Yeah uh the side effects.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah, I actually don't know.  I'm gonna have to talk my attending about it.

PATIENT O439
Yeah cause I been taking that a long time.  I can't seem to get my cholesterol down and I eat healthy but I do go overboard.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Okay.  

PATIENT O439
With all the exercise I do, I mean I do two or three hours of exercises a day for about three or four days a week, sometimes five, sometimes six.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
I say man, I try to mix it up, I go walking, I ride my bike, stationary, I do yoga, I do cardio swim now, I do another exercise tape.  I do all kinds of stretches.  

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Let's do this, let me go DOCTOR know about you okay.

PATIENT O439
Okay.

DOCTOR O439
And then we'll go from there.  I'll be right back in just a minute.

PATIENT O439
Okay, okay, thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  102:3  DOCTOR IN:  107:20)

DOCTOR O439
Alright now, so a couple of things.  We just want you to give a urine sample.

PATIENT O439
Okay.

DOCTOR O439
To make sure there's nothing going on with your bladder that um also cause you're kind of having some tenderness in your belly kind of in funny places so we'd like to check some labs on you um and go from there.  Um this is happening kind of intermittently in the last several weeks is that right?

PATIENT O439
Right.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.

PATIENT O439
But the first time was about a month ago.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  So if this worsens at all, don't hesitate to come back here.

PATIENT O439
Okay.

DOCTOR O439
If they can’t get you in here, you can come to the ER.

PATIENT O439
Yeah.

DOCTOR O439
Um and if the labs are normal, we might just have to pursue some imaging okay but uh like a CAT scan or something.

PATIENT O439
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O439
I don't think we need to go that far, I think just like I think the urine is kind of where the money is.

PATIENT O439
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O439
Um especially cause you had the you know some infection this summer so um I think we'll start there um and go from there.  Then we'll have you follow up in the Women's Health Clinic as well, just to kind of set you up with your routine screenings.

PATIENT O439
Okay.  And what do you think about switching things @@@.

DOCTOR O439
Okay let me take a look see.

PATIENT O439
It's hard.

DOCTOR O439
That's right.

PATIENT O439
It's right here.

DOCTOR O439
Now did you say is it painful?

PATIENT O439
No.

DOCTOR O439
It doesn't hurt.

PATIENT O439
No it's just hard.

DOCTOR O439
Got it, okay.

PATIENT O439
That came about four months ago and this one bout a month ago here.

DOCTOR O439
Have you ever had this problem before @@@?

PATIENT O439
No and I got a ring worm too.  I put some uh.

DOCTOR O439
Some cream on there?

PATIENT O439
Yeah I put some hydrochloride or something.

DOCTOR O439
Okay got it.

PATIENT O439
I got it from a hotel I'm sure.

DOCTOR O439
You did okay.

PATIENT O439
Yeah.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah, alright.  Do you want some terbinafine cream?  Is that.

PATIENT O439
I got some.

DOCTOR O439
Is the cream working?

PATIENT O439
Yeah it's working.

DOCTOR O439
It's working okay good.

PATIENT O439
Yeah I did make up some soda and Vaseline but then I went and bought some.

DOCTOR O439
Okay.  Cause it could be the beginnings of, they call it the Morgan Freeman spots.

PATIENT O439
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O439
It could be that.

PATIENT O439
Okay.

DOCTOR O439
Um if you have, I think there's a fancy name for it but everybody knows it as the Morgan Freeman @@@.

PATIENT O439
Oh okay well it you don't think that is anything to worry about.

DOCTOR O439
No, I absolutely, nothing like @@@ not cancer.

PATIENT O439
Yeah it's just; yeah it just looked like a bread crumb.

DOCTOR O439
Right.

PATIENT O439
And I @@@ you know when someone tells me to wipe my mouth.

DOCTOR O439
If they get worse or like if there's new ones that are popping up or if they become painful.

PATIENT O439
Okay.

DOCTOR O439
Just let us know.

PATIENT O439

PATIENT O439
So what am I gonna, so don't forget the cholesterol stuff.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah so look okay, I'll put in all the refills for everything and yeah we'll extend it out so that you can get like.

PATIENT O439
Yeah all I have to do is call it in and get it.

DOCTOR O439
Exactly.

PATIENT O439
On the phone.

DOCTOR O439
Uh what I could do too is I'll put in all the lab work for you to make sure you're not having any problems, so just stop by the Lab.

PATIENT O439
Oh you know what I might be able to do that now, I mean.   What do you want me to do now?

DOCTOR O439
Oh just some blood and then urine.

PATIENT O439
Okay.

DOCTOR O439
That's the only thing and then you're done.

PATIENT O439
Okay.  What's your blood for?

DOCTOR O439
Uh blood is for your belly.

PATIENT O439
Okay.

DOCTOR O439
We want to make sure there's nothing going on.

PATIENT O439
So you don't think while you're at it that my cholesterol should be checked again or don't you?

DOCTOR O439
So here's the deal, you had.  Let me take a look here I wrote it down.

PATIENT O439
I think, I don't know when the last time I had it.  I think it was, may have been in June.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah we can do you in every year so you're not due for another like six months.

PATIENT O439
Oh okay, they were doing it every six months.

DOCTOR O439
Yeah, I'm happy with how things look with your cholesterol.

PATIENT O439
Okay, great, okay.

DOCTOR O439
I want you to just hand that to the clerk right here and they'll schedule you for Women's Health.

PATIENT O439
Oh okay.

DOCTOR O439
Okay. 

PATIENT O439
Thank you so much.

DOCTOR O439
Very good, thank you ma'am.
