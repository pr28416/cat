At night right.

DOCTOR I643
Okay.  Do you want.  We can, why don't we increase the doxazosin dose then?

PATIENT I643
Uh if I'm taking it, I'm going to the bathroom a lot.

DOCTOR I643
Okay.

PATIENT I643
Not a lot of beer but a little bit more than what I should.

DOCTOR I643
Okay.

PATIENT I643
But nothing else, no drugs, no cigarettes, no nothing like that uh-huh.

DOCTOR I643

PATIENT I643
Which one are those?

DOCTOR I643
Of the doxazosin.

PATIENT I643
Uh yes uh-huh.

So essentially what I'm doing is doubling the dose.

PATIENT I643
Okay.

DOCTOR I643
So um right now you're taking half a tablet.

PATIENT I643
Taking half right.

DOCTOR I643
Okay why don't you start taking a full tablet?

PATIENT I643
Okay.

DOCTOR I643
Okay.  I went ahead and put a new order in here though cause that means you'll run out of it before your refill is due.

PATIENT I643
Okay, right.

DOCTOR I643
So I went ahead and changed the order in the computer okay.

PATIENT I643
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR I643
So let's see if that helps a little bit.

PATIENT I643
Okay, alrighty.

DOCTOR I643
Are you seen in the GU Clinic here?  It doesn't look like you are.  Well why don't we try that change.

PATIENT I643
Okay.

DOCTOR I643
If that change doesn't work then we'll send you to the urinary doctors.

PATIENT I643
Oh okay.

DOCTOR I643
They're the specialists.

PATIENT I643
Okay.

DOCTOR I643
Cause they have access to more medicines and they can order more stuff than us.

PATIENT I643
Okay, so instead of just taking a half at night.

DOCTOR I643
Take a full tablet.

PATIENT I643
I take a full tablet okay.

DOCTOR I643
Yeah, yeah and then when your, when you run out then the next prescription will reflect the whole tablet.

PATIENT I643
Oh okay, alrighty.

DOCTOR I643
Um let's see what else.  I think that's everything for you.  So you had a colonoscopy in @@@@ so we'll need to repeat that next year.

PATIENT I643
Okay, alright, okay.

DOCTOR I643
Um and you say you're not using, you’re not smoking now, did you ever smoke in the past?

PATIENT I643
No you've really explained everything quite well for me and I appreciate it.

DOCTOR I643

(DOCTOR OUT:  43:17  DOCTOR IN:  54:38)

DOCTOR I643
Alright.

PATIENT I643
Okay.

DOCTOR I643
Just one little thing um.

PATIENT I643
Okay.

DOCTOR I643
So for the nausea that you're having.

PATIENT I643
Right.

DOCTOR I643
You're telling me you are having it every morning right?

PATIENT I643
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR I643
And you're taking the @@@ in the morning.

PATIENT I643
Right uh-huh.

DOCTOR I643
And it usually goes away.

PATIENT I643
Right uh-huh.

DOCTOR I643
So since it's only in the morning or you notice it in the morning when you wake up.

PATIENT I643
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I643
It might be reflux because you’re lying down.

PATIENT I643
Oh okay.

DOCTOR I643
Up a little bit.

PATIENT I643
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I643
So I know you're taking the lansoprazole twice a day already.

PATIENT I643
Right, right.

DOCTOR I643
And I know they told you to do ranitidine only if you need it.

PATIENT I643
Right.

DOCTOR I643
But perhaps you should try, keep taking the lansoprazole twice a day.

PATIENT I643
Right okay.

DOCTOR I643
And take the ranitidine right before you go to bed every night.

PATIENT I643
Okay.

DOCTOR I643
Irregardless of whether or not you feel the reflux cause sometimes you don't feel the reflux pain but you actually do have reflux so.

PATIENT I643
Oh.

DOCTOR I643
It may be the reason you have nausea in the morning, who knows.

PATIENT I643
Oh okay right, okay.

DOCTOR I643
We'll see if that works.

PATIENT I643
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I643
Um if you, you know if you keep having symptoms and the reflux doesn't get better there's always a surgical option.  I don't know if anyone's talked to you about that or maybe you just didn't want it or anything cause you've got that hernia.

PATIENT I643
Right, right.

DOCTOR I643
Cause you do have the reflux because of the hernia.

PATIENT I643
Okay.

DOCTOR I643
Some people have reflux just because they do and we don't know why.

PATIENT I643
Right.

DOCTOR I643
You actually have a reason to have reflux.

PATIENT I643
Right okay.

DOCTOR I643
So we'll try that.  Try scheduling it at night, the ranitidine.  Take it at night even if you don't think you do.

PATIENT I643
Even okay.

DOCTOR I643
Okay.

PATIENT I643
Okay.

DOCTOR I643
And then um.

PATIENT I643
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I643
And then we'll see how it goes and we can follow up with the stomach doctors, the GI doctors.

PATIENT I643
Right okay.

DOCTOR I643
In a couple months.

PATIENT I643
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I643
Then you can let them know how you're doing and.

PATIENT I643
Okay.

DOCTOR I643
Cause they would be the ones who say you know you should do the surgery, now they won't do the surgery.

PATIENT I643
Right.

DOCTOR I643
But they can make a suggestion as to whether you need it.

PATIENT I643
Okay right.

DOCTOR I643
Okay.

PATIENT I643
So the lansoprazole take two in the morning, two in the evening and also, whether I think I need it or not, to take the ranitidine.

DOCTOR I643
Yes.

PATIENT I643
I will do that.

DOCTOR I643
