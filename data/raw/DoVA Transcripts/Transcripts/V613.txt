PATIENT V613
Yeah.

DOCTOR V613
Fine.  How um, how have your sugars been?

PATIENT V613
She can tell you everything.

THIRD PERSON V613
No I've been testing his blood pressures.  He has not been testing his sugars.  So I got a record of his blood pressure.

DOCTOR V613
Oh perfect.

THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V613
That's my doctor at home.

THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh, thank you.

DOCTOR V613
What we could do.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
We could all be so lucky to have a doctor at home.

PATIENT V613
She's not the doctor.  She make sure what time I'm gonna take my medicine or I got a sweet wife.

DOCTOR V613
It looks like he didn’t take you off it.

PATIENT V613
See so I called.

DOCTOR V613
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V613
To get it.

DOCTOR V613
Yeah refilled and then they didn't want to yeah.

PATIENT V613
They said we don't have that number and that was it.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.  We'll refill, I'm gonna refill that for you.  Okay it looks like he had it on the record like it's supposed to be on there.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.  Thank you.

PATIENT V613
They can send it out right?

DOCTOR V613
Okay.  They do, so you didn't take this this morning right?

THIRD PERSON V613
No.

PATIENT V613
No.

DOCTOR V613
Okay and yesterday neither?

THIRD PERSON V613
We haven't had it for two weeks or more.

PATIENT V613
Past two weeks.

DOCTOR V613
Two weeks.

THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V613
Right.

THIRD PERSON V613
He’s been doing good, though.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.  We may just add on the.

PATIENT V613
Yeah cause I called about this.

DOCTOR V613
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V613
And they said we don't have it on record.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.  And I know your sugars were good back in December too they were saying.  They had checked kind of a three month period.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay right.

DOCTOR V613
That looked good.  I think we may check another one today to see how your sugars have been.  It's a blood test that they check to see how your sugars have been averaging over the last three months.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
So we'll do that today too.

THIRD PERSON V613
Now they said for PATIENT to take just the insulin at home, that is the 35 units he takes at night.  He doesn't do good when he has to take that at night.

DOCTOR V613
In the morning.

THIRD PERSON V613
Right.  What I had did when he first started on it.

DOCTOR V613
Uh-huh.

THIRD PERSON V613
I was giving it to him in the morning.

DOCTOR V613
Okay, that's okay.

THIRD PERDON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
That's okay cause that should be the last thing I believe, quite some time Aspart in the morning.  That's fine.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
In the morning is fine as long.

THIRD PERSON V613
Thank you.

DOCTOR V613
Since his sugars looked okay um back in September so I'm okay with keeping that level of insulin.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR V613
Uh-huh so we'll keep that as well.  And I know you saw the eye doctor and the foot doctor so that's good and how's your knee?

PATIENT V613
Don’t talk to me about these damn feet.  What it is, they stiffen up.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.

PATIENT V613
And it's hard to get, see you have to push up.  Now that was just a little easy but they’re stiff.

DOCTOR V613
They’re really stiff, okay.

PATIENT V613
And they said that they're not gonna put new ones in there.

DOCTOR V613
What they, they said yeah.

PATIENT V613
They did somehing they get, it’s  harder to get up.

DOCTOR V613
It gets hard to get up okay.  I think one of the things that they were recommending was to set you up with the physical therapist to see if we can get you know some sort of stretches or something to kind of help you @@@ the muscles around there to see if maybe it would make it a little easier.

PATIENT V613
I gotta do something with it.

DOCTOR V613
So I'd like to send you back to see if you need to see the physical therapist okay to see you know what they can do to help you out there.

PATIENT V613
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V613
And get you a little bit yeah okay.

THIRD PERSON V613
Because he has a very hard time getting up at home too.

DOCTOR V613
Sure, I saw that.  

THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V613
It took you a while to get up out of the chair.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

PATIENT V613
It takes me longer than that.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.

PATIENT V613
Cause that chair hits me right in the @@@.

DOCTOR V613
Sure okay.  And then let me check to make sure you have.  Any other medications that needs to be refilled?

THIRD PERSON V613
No, no.

PATIENT V613
No.

THIRD PERSON V613
Uh uh.

DOCTOR V613
Okay and um and your blood tests back in September looked pretty good and we only check them out once every few months anyway.  The only one is the one for the diabetes to see how your sugars have been and if we need to adjust anything.

PATIENT V613
I feel fine.  I'm not gonna take beat around the bush cause some guys say they feel fine and they don’t then.

DOCTOR V613
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V613
But I try to take care of myself.

DOCTOR V613
Good.

PATIENT V613
And my wife looks out after me too.

THIRD PERSON V613
Yeah I do.

DOCTOR V613
Good.  @@@ and I know they sent you for the, let me check and see how your, how the blood flow was in your legs too.

THIRD PERSON V613
That's correct.

DOCTOR V613
Your right leg looks good.  You just have a little bit of; you know how they say in the heart arteries you can have some plaque build up?

THIRD PERSON V613
Right.

DOCTOR V613
Well on the left side you did have a little bit.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
Um so, one other things @@@ I'm gonna check it.  You're already on the aspirin which is what we would recommend doing for that anyway.

THIRD PERSON V613
That's good to know.

DOCTOR V613
So.

PATIENT V613
But when its, she's the one who knows all of my medicines.

THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V613
Yeah I know, DOCTOR called.

THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.  Yeah for management.

PATIENT V613
@@@.

DOCTOR V613

THIRD PERSON V613
That's right.  Yeah we're having problems because PATIENT can't get up on time sometimes we’re having accidents.

DOCTOR V613
Oh okay.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay we have this thing that helps him get up.

DOCTOR V613
Uh-huh.

THIRD PERSON V613
@@@ off the bed @@@ North Carolina.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.

THIRD PERSON V613
Like a seat.  They fit on the seat.

DOCTOR V613

THIRD PERSON V613
Push the button, it came up.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.

THIRD PERSON V613

DOCTOR V613
Oh it's a chair.

THIRD PERSON V613
Yeah.  I want a chair that's leather.

DOCTOR V613
Yeah.

THIRD PERSON V613

THIRD PERSON V613

PATIENT V613

THIRD PERSON V613

DOCTOR V613

THIRD PERSON V613

DOCTOR V613

THIRD PERSON V613

DOCTOR V613

DOCTOR V613

THIRD PERSON V613
He has a cold.

DOCTOR V613

PATIENT V613
No pain.  Well down here in my.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.  Just breathe normally.  Any belly pain, trouble eating?

PATIENT V613

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  45:52  DOCTOR IN:  49:18)

DOCTOR V613
Okay so the deal with the chair is that they want to see you first, the physical therapists.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
They want to do their evaluation but we may be able to get you that were placed and see if you can go up and have you talk with them first but if not then they um, they will get you the appointment as soon as possible and get you evaluated for that.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.  Alright.  Give me one second let me just put in some of the orders here and then I can see if I can, if I can order it I'll do it but it sounds like from what I  heard from the other doctors they have to do the formal evaluation.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
Before they issue that.

THIRD PERSON V613
You know I have Humana health insurance and the man wanted to sign PATIENT up just in case something happens, something happens when we can't get over here at night.  Will he lose his VA if he signed up for that?

DOCTOR V613
That I don't know.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
That either we'll have to; you'll have to check with the Finance Office or something.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
That's something that I don't know.

THIRD PERSON V613
Oh okay.

DOCTOR V613
I actually don't know the answer to that unfortunately.

THIRD PERSON V613
Thank you.

DOCTOR V613
So.

THIRD PERSON V613
If nothing I'll just call, call someone who calls me back, it's better to know.  Cause I want to find medicine @@@.

DOCTOR V613
So you want to pick it up here or do you want it mailed to you?

THIRD PERSON V613
Uh you can mail it.

PATIENT V613
Mail it.

DOCTOR V613
Mail it okay.

THIRD PERSON V613

DOCTOR V613

THIRD PERSON V613

DOCTOR V613
Sure.  Okay I just wanted to make sure.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay cause he'll need the @@@.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.  So we don't uh do the renewals on most of these medicines, some of them in the chart are coming up.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
So that you know just when you need to call it in they will have it.

THIRD PERSON V613
Oh okay, thank you.

DOCTOR V613
Any questions about anything else?

PATIENT V613
Something with my back, that's what I told you about my back with you know a while back.  That's.

THIRD PERSON V613
@@@ arthritis in your lower back.  But I think, I hear that arthritis can be cured.

DOCTOR V613
It depends on what type of kind of arthritis.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
Sometimes it’s surgical.

THIRD PERSON V613
Oh okay.

DOCTOR V613
But in the meantime since we're gonna send you to Physical Therapy for your knee anyway we'll have them see what they can do about your back and kind of strengthen the back muscles – the joints.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
Cause usually we start there first and sometimes that'll help you know so.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.  And when do the grownups start to get the whooping cough?

DOCTOR V613
When your cough doesn't go away for a few months.

THIRD PERSON V613
Oh okay.

DOCTOR V613
Yeah, yeah.

THIRD PERSON V613
A few months.

DOCTOR V613
That's the sort of thing that, because everybody gets the shot as a kid.

THIRD PERSON V613
Right.

DOCTOR V613
Um but you know sometimes they recommend getting another one.

THIRD PERSON V613
Oh okay.

DOCTOR V613
At some point.  Um if your cold doesn't get better in a couple of weeks come on back and we'll take an x-ray and see what's going on.

PATIENT V613
See my back is.

DOCTOR V613
Yeah I'm sorry.

Runny nose and all that doesn't get better in a couple of weeks, come on back okay.  They'll see you.  There's always the Walk-In Clinic too that you can’t do is.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
Okay.  Alright give me one second.  And then we should probably make sure of the phone number NUMBER?

THIRD PERSON V613
That's correct.

PATIENT V613
That's it.

DOCTOR V613
We'll give you a call if we need to adjust your insulin if when the find the A1c, the three months average comes back @@@.

THIRD PERSON V613

Good. I put in an equipment request.

THIRD PERSON V613
Hmm.

DOCTOR V613
And one other thing the 25 to 35 um and she can try to pick up something like that uh today.  Um if they say no then what we'll do is we'll wait for the evaluation. There’s going to be two parts, the therapist's evaluation to kind of see what they can do about your knee and the back.

THIRD PERSON V613
Okay.

DOCTOR V613
And then um the, the uh, the other evaluation to see what kind of equipment that I can order you before.

Okay let me see here.  Um and they have like canes and walkers or grab bars.  Can you describe that again to me, a chair, a lift?

THIRD PERSON V613

DOCTOR V613
Okay.  

PATIENT V613
Oh I forgot all about that thing.

THIRD PERSON V613
Uh-huh.  But our furniture's leather so it's confused cause the furniture goes.  When you sit the furniture goes down.
