DOCTOR F276
Okay.

SECOND PERSON F276
For him at home.

DOCTOR F276
What's the situation at home now?

SECOND PERSON F276
He has Florence, his lady friend who lives with him and she is absolute helpful.

DOCTOR F276
Really.

SECOND PERSON F276
Helping him remember to take his medicine and all that but she is partially in a wheelchair.  She can stand but it's mostly to get around,she’s in the wheelchair.

DOCTOR F276
Okay.

SECOND PERSON F276
So we do have a nurse come in through the VA.

DOCTOR F276
Sure.  Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON F276
Uh one or two times a week to make sure he has medicines um you know just set that up daily to make sure he takes his inhalers and that type of thing and they have experienced the days where he's had a bad day.

DOCTOR F276
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON F276
And had uh notified me that you know that he's sometimes progressing in the wrong direction.

DOCTOR F276
Sure.

SECOND PERSON F276
Regressing.  So the um, they note and definitely notate in their documentation what they see.

DOCTOR F276
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON F276
So the doctors can understand what's going on, you know, daily basis.

DOCTOR F276
Sure.

SECOND PERSON F276
And they said absolutely and they have spoken with DOCTOR so she knows um what they’ve seen firsthand.

DOCTOR F276
Sure.

SECOND PERSON F276

DOCTOR F276
Right.

SECOND PERSON F276
You know.

DOCTOR F276
Okay.  Um let's see @@@.  

SECOND PERSON F276

DOCTOR F276
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON F276
He doesn’t know who you are are or anything.

DOCTOR F276
Okay.  Okay and let me check his medications here real quick.  

SECOND PERSON F276
Oh and I think he's out of the um, everything he’s normally taking now @@@ but the um depression pill.

DOCTOR F276
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON F276
I think that needs a refill and possibly the galantamine.

DOCTOR F276
Okay and does he get all those in the mail?

SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F276
Okay yeah, the galantamine is um.

SECOND PERSON F276

SECOND PERSON F276
That one.

DOCTOR F276
Okay.

SECOND PERSON F276
@@@.

DOCTOR F276

SECOND PERSON F276

SECOND PERSON F276

DOCTOR F276
Everything else looks good though.

SECOND PERSON F276
Good. The brains uh from the head.  

DOCTOR F276

SECOND PERSON F276
He did.

DOCTOR F276
@@@

SECOND PERSON F276
@@@.

DOCTOR F276
There we are, yep there are no changes and I guess I actually looked at this earlier today um.  So you noticed some changes 
from the @@@ um in the past.

SECOND PERSON F276
Pardon me?

DOCTOR F276
There are changes that are old in the past, so maybe some old @@@ or an old stroke but it's not recent.

SECOND PERSON F276
Recent okay.

DOCTOR F276
So that's good.

SECOND PERSON F276
Yeah it is good.

DOCTOR F276
Yeah.  Um okay let me grab her and I'll be right back.

SECOND PERSON F276
What were the blood tests?

DOCTOR F276
So we had, right we did a liver test, the cholesterol which looks like it's controlled.  We did the blood count for like the hemoglobin and anemia which we took a look at and then we checked his kidney function which was okay.

SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F276
And then we checked the TSH which is thyroid and the B12 um which can sometimes be abnormal and can affect people on memory loss, that is still pending.  Uh the TSH was normal though.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.

DOCTOR F276
That's another thing that can affect memory, too.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.

DOCTOR F276
Um so um so we will have, um what we talked about is having you go to the PAC.

SECOND PERSON F276
Right.

DOCTOR F276
And um it's near the Emergency Room.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.

DOCTOR F276
And there's a physician there that you can talk to, it's a walk-in clinic.

SECOND PERSON F276
Oh.

DOCTOR F276
So um we can call there before you go or something but um.

SECOND PERSON F276
@@@.

DOCTOR F276
We'll get.

SECOND PERSON F276
Yeah.

DOCTOR F276
Yeah okay.  I will be right back.

SECOND PERSON F276
Is the iron low?  Cause he is on iron but its.

DOCTOR F276
Um his hemoglobin's okay.  We didn't check the iron.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay that's fine yeah.

DOCTOR F276
I'll be right back.

SECOND PERSON F276
Oh okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  85:50  DOCTOR IN:  98:40)

DOCTOR F276
Alright PATIENT how are you?

PATIENT F276
I'm doing good, how about you?

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Alright um so, you don’t think you’re sleeping good?  Your sleep is good.  Do you sleep good?

PATIENT F276
Oh yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
@@@ some days are good and others are not?

PATIENT F276
Yeah like a baby.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Not all day though?  Not all day, you don't sleep like a baby.

PATIENT F276
No, no, no.  @@@.

Doctors speak with one another about treatment.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
His blood pressure is a little bit on the low side but does it run low at home?

SECOND PERSON F276
Yeah and he doesn't drink enough water and I just wanted to make sure.  Is he on any medicines, his blood pressure? No, right?

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Blood pressure @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR F276
Yeah he's @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Okay so here is the plan.  So we'll get some potassium since the level is just a little bit @@@ okay.  Oh and then go to the PAC Clinic, DOCTOR already know about him um so I want him to be evaluated to see if any medications would help him you know getting this.  I think @@@ we need to prevent not able to sleep at night.

SECOND PERSON F276
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
So I think that's kind of sedating the next day so when he doesn't rest then obviously he's a lot more confused, a lot more paranoid and that makes things worse.

SECOND PERSON F276
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
So we'll see what they will send us.

PATIENT F276
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Cause it's still psychiatry's stuff so.  And then as far as home-based health care aid, they will contact you.  I gave your number to her.

SECOND PERSON F276
No you didn't give me a number.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
No I gave your number to her and they will contact you.

SECOND PERSON F276
Oh.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Because they need the family member's approval.  So he gets the visiting nurse but the visiting nurse has to stop and let these people take over because the nurse also comes from the VA.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay, so what do you think about the Home Health Care?

SECOND DOCTOR F276
I think it is, because he can't come to so many appointments and his situation may need more of home therapy based rather than consult based.

SECOND PERSON F276
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
So I think that is uh, that is a good thing.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
In fact I would um, I would recommend that.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Um not that I don't like PATIENT because it's that a lot more easier.

SECOND PERSON F276
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
For him to get more care.  Especially the physical therapy and other things also.

SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Okay, alright and then um let us see, they may have, sometimes they don't have opening available in that area so we don't even know anymore ourselves but at least give it a try.

SECOND PERSON F276
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Um and then the, you have a homemaker?

SECOND PERSON F276
Um.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Actually, do you want a homemaker?

SECOND PERSON F276
What do they do, cleaning?

PATIENT F276
No, no, no, no, no.

SECOND PERSON F276
Dad.

PATIENT F276
No issue with my house.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
So that is the only other help that @@@ that's helping him.

SECOND PERSON F276
The um, cause NAME has someone come in.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Oh okay.

SECOND PERSON F276
To do the like a little bit of cleaning.  No cooking though.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
No they don't cook, it's just cleaning.

SECOND PERSON F276
Do they clean?

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON F276
Then right now no.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Okay.  Alright.  So we'll just wait for the @@@ to do that.

SECOND PERSON F276
And then if we change our mind we could, cause we won't be seeing you then.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Um they say @@@ will be the primary physician.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Um the, so but uh I think given the whole benefit of the program.

SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
That may be good for him though.

SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Okay.

SECOND PERSON F276
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
So because.

SECOND PERSON F276
DOCTOR. You like the program?

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Yeah they are usually pretty good.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
They talk with physical therapy, the nurses are called I mean you have a lot more access to the nurses if they did, if he gets sick they are more @@@.

SECOND PERSON F276
So @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Yeah that's what I’m saying, if he gets sick the nurse will rush right @@@.  That's part of the same as what I would do but on the other hand getting like him not coming for more appointments and especially with physical therapy and stuff like that uh that would be more convenient at home.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay and you would initiate that and they'll @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
I already did.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
They will find out whether or not there are any available in your area.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.  Thank you doctor.

SECOND DOCTOR F276
Okay.  So before you go home.

SECOND PERSON F276
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR F276

FIRST DOCTOR F276
Um HP, HP, HBPC, Home-Based Primary Care that's what she's saying so @@@.  It could either be a doctor or a physical therapy that will take over.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR F276
And they would keep watch over @@@ instead of the hospital, I mean clinic.  Okay, let me put in the consult, so this is where you go in, once I put this order in.

SECOND PERSON F276
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR F276
Uh what's a current phone number?  @@@.
