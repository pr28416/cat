PATIENT X147
Yeah I thought it wasn’t long.

DOCTOR X147
About a month ago.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
Um.

PATIENT X147
But you changed up some medications on me and stuff like that.

DOCTOR X147
Your blood pressure wasn't where we wanted it to be so we added this medication called @@@.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
Um how have your blood pressures been since then?

PATIENT X147
Well doc you know it's improving.  It's improving.  She just checked it a little while ago so.  I think she said it was 127 or something like that.

DOCTOR X147
That is more than improving.

PATIENT X147
Huh?

DOCTOR X147
That's more than improving.

PATIENT X147
Yeah, yeah it's coming right along.  Uh I got a little something else to it.

DOCTOR X147
What's that?

PATIENT X147
Uh I been drinking garlic water.

DOCTOR X147
Oh okay.

PATIENT X147
You heard of that?

DOCTOR X147
Uh I've heard of garlic water.

PATIENT X147
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X147
I don't know if it's really that true.

PATIENT X147
It’s one of those down-home remedies.

DOCTOR X147
Yeah.

PATIENT X147
Yeah so uh a buddy of mine was saying that you could take a little chopped up garlic and swallow all of it or what I've done was I've just taken chopped up some in a water bottle and I've been just swallowing that stuff in the morning and uh sometime in the evening before I go to bed.  It don't smell the best but it seem like it might helping though some.

DOCTOR X147
It's probably the medications.

PATIENT X147
(Laughter)  We put those together yes, yeah I didn't @@@.

DOCTOR X147
I wouldn't stop the medication.

PATIENT X147
Yeah I know, I know.

DOCTOR X147
@@@.

PATIENT X147
It's just.

DOCTOR X147
You ended up going back to the PM&R people to complete your therapy.

PATIENT X147
For my leg?

DOCTOR X147
Yeah.  Did you talk with them?

PATIENT X147
Uh well yeah.  What they suggested was that um I could just go for the workout system here.

DOCTOR X147
@@@.

PATIENT X147
Yeah.  They got a little @@@.  I ain't found it yet.  Do you know where it is?

DOCTOR X147
Uh we can ask outside.  Actually I've never been to it.

PATIENT X147
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X147
We put an order in so you're approved to get it.

PATIENT X147
Right, yeah, she put it all in the computer here.  But you see the thing is doc could you, I want to see the dentist you know for my teeth and what have you.

DOCTOR X147
Yeah.

PATIENT X147
And uh they said that I have to get it approved by the doctor.

DOCTOR X147
Yeah you have to have so it depends on what you need from the dentist.

PATIENT X147
Huh?

DOCTOR X147
It's not that I have to approve anything.  I just put in the order to go to the dentist.  But I’ll tell you what the dentist offers here.  If you have a active infection of any of your teeth where you have like pus pouring out of your tooth they'll see you and take care of it.  If it's a chronic problem like cavities or bad teeth, they will pull your teeth out but they don't put anything in and they don't do the routine cleaning.

PATIENT X147
@@@.

DOCTOR X147
The VA does not offer actual dental care.

PATIENT X147
Even if you didn't uh @@@.

DOCTOR X147
If you're neglecting your teeth and you have infections then they'll say okay well we can deal with this.  I'll send you to the dentist but I'm pretty confident they're gonna tell you there's nothing going on, unless they can find something in your mouth that shows there's an active infection from your diabetes.

PATIENT X147
Yeah I'll tell you what's going on, I feel a knot right here in my gum.  It's been there a long, sometime.  As a matter of fact when I was working and I went to the dentist he was saying that there was like an infection and if I pulled the tooth out that the knot would go away.  But the tooth ain't bad.  He said it's not the tooth, it's the bottom of the tooth.  It's the gum.  If you pull the tooth out the knot will go away.  But I don't want to do that, @@@ tooth.  You know he's twisting my arm.  I pulled the tooth out the knot is still there.  That's been a year or two years ago.

DOCTOR X147
So it's probably not infection if it's been there for two years.

PATIENT X147
Uh it don't hurt anything I just wondered you know why it was still there.  He said it was gonna go away.

DOCTOR X147
I don't know, I'm not a dentist.

PATIENT X147
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X147
Um.

PATIENT X147
You ain't put @@@ or not.

DOCTOR X147
When did you start getting the dizziness?

PATIENT X147
Huh?

DOCTOR X147
When did you start getting dizzy?

PATIENT X147
Doc I'm gonna tell you ever since I been taking, start insulin, always sometimes having to be off balanced like uh feeling, they say that's part of the territory being a diabetic.

DOCTOR X147
No I mean, give me a time like an actual.  When did you start having the dizziness?  Like a year ago, six months ago, three or four years ago.  When were you started on insulin?  I don't know these details.

PATIENT X147
Okay I been on insulin for over 30, 32 to 33 years.

DOCTOR X147
Okay.  So, insulin gives you dizziness if your blood sugar is low.  So if you give yourself your insulin shot and your blood sugar goes to 50, then we.

PATIENT X147
It's not just dizzy; it felt like an off balance at time.  Like if you go around too quick.

DOCTOR X147
That won't be from the insulin.  It could be, if the diabetes affected your nerves.

PATIENT X147
Okay.

DOCTOR X147
Cause that happens to people over the years.

PATIENT X147
Okay I'm tending to believe cause I do have neuropathy.

DOCTOR X147
Right.

PATIENT X147
In my feet too.

DOCTOR X147
There's the nerves in your legs, there's another kind of nervous system in the body called the autonomic nervous system.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
What that does it like when you stand up.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
That's the nerves that cause the veins to constrict to get your blood back up to the body so you don't get dizzy and lightheaded and those will get damaged over the years from diabetes.

PATIENT X147
Oh, @@@ okay.

DOCTOR X147
@@@.

PATIENT X147
I gotcha, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
Um that's another type of nerve damage.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
That's a little bit tougher to treat you know.  It doesn't work like you know @@@ gabapentin for neuropathy and that helps.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
But there's not too many good ways to treat that.

PATIENT X147
I see.

DOCTOR X147
Other than get the glucose controlled.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
How have your blood sugars been?

PATIENT X147
Oh it's coming along pretty good.

DOCTOR X147
How is, what’s pretty good?  Remember everyone has different ideas of pretty good.

PATIENT X147
I know doc, it's just that, it's down.  I'll put it that way in the morning time, sometimes like 200 uh sometimes uh like 150; it depends on what I eat that night.  I know it should be around 120 or 100.

DOCTOR X147
Yeah you know better.

PATIENT X147
Ah doc, you know what I'm trying to say.  Trying to control this sometimes is almost like trying to walk, I feel like I could walk a tightrope better than I can try to get this down you know.  It's just, but it's up to me, you got to do it on your own.  All you can do is tell me what to do and give me some @@@, the rest is up to me.

DOCTOR X147
That's true.  What's holding you back?

PATIENT X147
My back?

DOCTOR X147
No what's holding you back from having good control of your blood sugars?

PATIENT X147
Oh just uh the temptation.  You might say the temptation you know uh.  It's just the temptations I guess, it's like the world and the shape that it's in today.

DOCTOR X147
Yeah.

PATIENT X147
All these holidays.  You got especially cake laying all over the table and it's hard to just walk by it and just don't get a little bitty piece.  You can do it cause you're a doctor right?

DOCTOR X147
No.

PATIENT X147
(Laughter).

DOCTOR X147
No I have the same problem.

PATIENT X147
You got that problem too huh.

DOCTOR X147
Um, so what if we just try to go up on the insulin a little bit?  Just so @@@.

PATIENT X147
Yeah, but you know what, I wasn't allowed to go up any more you know but I'll probably come down on the eating.

DOCTOR X147
Alright @@@.  

PATIENT X147
Yeah.

DOCTOR X147
As long as you understand and you have a plan.

PATIENT X147
That's where the problem is.  You know if you go up on the insulin, you’re gonna say, “Nah, I’m on top of it” and then I'm just gonna start eating more.

DOCTOR X147
Okay.  So if.

PATIENT X147
Do you know what I'm saying?

DOCTOR X147
I know what you're saying.  Just as long as you understand.

PATIENT X147
@@@.

DOCTOR X147
I gotcha.

PATIENT X147
Yeah.  I just have to stop putting too much food or overeating in my mouth, that's just what it is.

DOCTOR X147
I want to make sure you've got @@@.

PATIENT X147
Yeah I do these uh, @@@ yeah I know I.

DOCTOR X147

PATIENT X147

PATIENT X147

DOCTOR X147
Yeah that should be right.  Just take them till you run out and when you run out let me know and we'll recheck your levels.

PATIENT X147
Okay.  But uh I'm on my last bottle of the insulin.

DOCTOR X147
Um.  (Someone comes to the door)  @@@ needs to be ordered then but your insulin you have ten refills on one of them.

PATIENT X147

DOCTOR X147

DOCTOR X147
They're all available now.  There's like two or three refills for each one so.

PATIENT X147
But does it indicate that I need to @@@?

DOCTOR X147

DOCTOR X147

PATIENT X147
Okay. 

DOCTOR X147
(Someone comes to the door)  Sorry PATIENT they needed directions.

PATIENT X147
That's no problem; you know I know how it is.

DOCTOR X147
So yeah the new one we gave you.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
I gave you a 90 day supply so that's three months.

PATIENT X147
Yeah because you told me to take one and then you upped it to take one in the morning and one in the evening.

DOCTOR X147
Right.  That was back in the first of November or.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
There was 90 pills given.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
At that time so.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
That should last you three months and then you have two refills from there.

PATIENT X147
That should last for how long?

DOCTOR X147
90 pills.

PATIENT X147
Should last for.

DOCTOR X147
You're taking half a tablet in the morning, half in the afternoon.

PATIENT X147
No I'm taking a whole.

DOCTOR X147
You're taking a whole?

PATIENT X147
You switched it to a whole one; somebody did to a whole one in the morning and a whole one in the evening.

DOCTOR X147
Oh okay well then.

PATIENT X147
Did you see who ordered it?

DOCTOR X147
They didn't change the order.

PATIENT X147
Maybe you could change that.

DOCTOR X147
Yeah I'll change that so that they.

PATIENT X147
Yeah.  You know I don't want to get mixed up because one doctor says one thing and one doctor changes it back again.

DOCTOR X147
No, no, I'm glad you did, I gotcha.  I'm glad you brought that in.

PATIENT X147
Yeah.

DOCTOR X147
Oh the renal doctor did.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
The kidney doctor okay.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.  So then let's watch it, looks like that supply is getting a little low huh.

DOCTOR X147
That's fine I'll refill it, no problem.

PATIENT X147
Is it okay with you?

DOCTOR X147
Yeah of course.

PATIENT X147
I mean to up the dose.

DOCTOR X147
Yeah well you can go as high as we need to get your blood pressure under control.

PATIENT X147
Okay.

DOCTOR X147
When you saw the kidney doctors your blood pressure is wasn’t good.

PATIENT X147
Okay.

DOCTOR X147
They look at the decision where.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
But it's like you said you know it's up to you.

PATIENT X147
Right.

DOCTOR X147
If we don't control your blood pressure, if we don't control your diabetes.

PATIENT X147
Right.

DOCTOR X147
You will be on dialysis.

PATIENT X147
Right.

DOCTOR X147
If you live long enough to get there.  You want to be dialysis?

PATIENT X147
No.  Is that what ya'll want?

DOCTOR X147
Of course not.

PATIENT X147
Me either.

DOCTOR X147
So if somebody tells me to take the higher dose of medication, I'm okay with it and you should be with it too if it means your blood pressure goes lower and you're 120/70 is where your blood pressure is now.  That's where you should be being that you have diabetes.

PATIENT X147
Okay.

DOCTOR X147
If it's ever above that, every day it's above that you're hurting your kidneys.  Same thing with the blood sugars.  So you got to really start working on the eating.  If you don't want to go up on your insulin and I'll respect your wishes then you've got to get with it with the food.

PATIENT X147
You're right.

DOCTOR X147
Yeah.  If you're gonna eat all of.

PATIENT X147
Yeah.

DOCTOR X147
I need to kick you in the pants sometimes though.

PATIENT X147
Yeah, yeah.  You only doing your job by telling me what to do.  It's up to me.

DOCTOR X147
Absolutely.  Do you have any questions or anything right now?

PATIENT X147
Yeah can you @@@.

DOCTOR X147
In your what?

PATIENT X147
In my ears.

DOCTOR X147
In your ears, yeah what's going on with your ears?

PATIENT X147
I still got this ringing in my ears.

DOCTOR X147
Oh yeah sorry the ringing.  Uh when did that start?

PATIENT X147
Oh it's going when I started taking these last pills, the blood pressure pills that you gave me.  I'm thinking it might come from that.  Is that possible?  That you can get a ringing in the ear?  I mean basically it's in this ear and sometimes you know it'll clog up sometimes.  Maybe it's @@@ I don't know.

DOCTOR X147
I'll take a look.  This is not a medication that usually causes ringing in the ear.

PATIENT X147
Okay.  No medications do that.

DOCTOR X147
No a lot of medications can.  The one you're on doesn't.

PATIENT X147
Oh it doesn't.

DOCTOR X147
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT X147
Okay.

DOCTOR X147
And to be honest with you, if you said, it might be part of the reason that it was the ringing in the ears, @@@ with the blood pressure.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
@@@.  Sometimes it's in your best interest just to deal with it.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
Cause it's keeping your blood pressure in a good place and we don't have any other blood pressure medications to give you @@@.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
You're on everything else already.  So we'll take a look and see.  Do you clean your ears regularly?

PATIENT X147
Um maybe once a week.

DOCTOR X147
What do you use to clean them?

PATIENT X147
What?

DOCTOR X147
What do you use to clean them?

PATIENT X147
Basically just the end of the towel, something like that you know.  Sometimes I don't feel, I think it's just the right ear.  When I put @@@ the first time I went in on this side and when I get it’s stopped up.

DOCTOR X147
So this is a good thing, if it's only one ear it's not the symptoms of the blood pressure medication.

PATIENT X147
Hmm.

DOCTOR X147
This oh okay I can tell you right now, I can't see into it.

PATIENT X147
What's up?

DOCTOR X147
It's covered in wax all the way.

PATIENT X147
Yeah, is that right?

DOCTOR X147
Yeah like I can't even, look, so here... 

PATIENT X147
Well my wife has said why don't you get the doctor to look in your ears and see what's wrong, you can't hear nothing.

DOCTOR X147
You can't even see into it.

PATIENT X147
Both of them?

DOCTOR X147
This one, this is the one that's totally clogged all the way.

PATIENT X147
Okay.

DOCTOR X147
I'll give you some drops to get ride of it.

PATIENT X147
Okay.  Sounds good.

DOCTOR X147
Um.  Have a seat here.  

PATIENT X147
Does fish, baked fish a good source of meet for you?

DOCTOR X147
Yeah baked fish.  Baked fish or grilled fish.  Fried fish is not.

PATIENT X147
Cause I'm trying to, I've been eating it for the last week or so and man I mean, my sugars are all the way down when I eat fish.

DOCTOR X147
Your sugar is good.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
Are they good @@@.

PATIENT X147
Yeah it works real good but it's just you know you get tired of just eating baked fish and eat something else.  Could be @@@.

DOCTOR X147
I ordered those drops we talked about and look at those teeth, okay.

PATIENT X147
Okay.

DOCTOR X147
Just lay back.  @@@ pharmacy you can pick up the ear drops and there's instructions on them on how to use them but basically you put the ear drop in, you let it sit there while it dissolves the wax.

PATIENT X147
Okay.

DOCTOR X147
Turn the head over and let it drain out.  You don't put anything in there to scrape it out.

PATIENT X147
Hmm.

DOCTOR X147
Or remove it yourself okay.

PATIENT X147
Just let the drop and let it dissolve in there, right?

DOCTOR X147
Yes.  Open your mouth, stick your tongue out.

PATIENT X147
@@@.

DOCTOR X147
This thing?

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
How long has that been there?

PATIENT X147
Too long, couple of years.

DOCTOR X147
You don’t need to see the dentist, you need to see the maxillofacial people it looks like something for the oral surgeons.

PATIENT X147
Yeah.

DOCTOR X147
We can have you see them and have them look at this.

PATIENT X147
Okay.

DOCTOR X147
Um.  I'm thinking @@@ diabetes, you know @@@.

PATIENT X147

DOCTOR X147
That's a large growth in your mouth.

PATIENT X147
Yeah.

DOCTOR X147
Deep breath.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
Okay.  Yeah you know I'm kind of confused what that is myself.  When you were describing it I thought it was gonna be a small bump.  It's definitely not infection.  It's a large growth of tissue there.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
So we'll have the facial, the oral facial surgeon who specialize in the jaws.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
And the bones of the face, we'll have them take a look at it to see if they could do a biopsy and figure out what it is.

PATIENT X147
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X147
Okay.

PATIENT X147
Okay.

DOCTOR X147
How long has it been there?

PATIENT X147
I'd say two years or more.

DOCTOR X147
Does it get bigger or is it staying the same size?

PATIENT X147
Hmm it might be a little bit bigger but it doesn't seem to get any smaller.  

DOCTOR X147
Are you a smoker?

PATIENT X147
No.

DOCTOR X147
Did you smoke when you were younger?

PATIENT X147
Um yeah when I was, like 20s or something like that.

DOCTOR X147
How long did you smoke for?

PATIENT X147

DOCTOR X147

PATIENT X147

DOCTOR X147
