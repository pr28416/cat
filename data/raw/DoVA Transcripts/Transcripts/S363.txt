DOCTOR S363
PATIENT.  How you doing?

PATIENT S363
Fine, fine.

DOCTOR S363
How have you been doing?

PATIENT S363
Oh fair to midland we'll say.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.  That's good.  That's always the question.

PATIENT S363
Each day gets a little slower.

DOCTOR S363
Does it?

PATIENT S363
Yes it does.

DOCTOR S363
Were you @@@ for Halloween?

PATIENT S363
Uh no, just answering the door.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.

PATIENT S363
With the kids.

DOCTOR S363
Well that'll be fun.

PATIENT S363
A lot of the children out the east coast are sad.

DOCTOR S363
I know.

PATIENT S363
What a disaster holy cow.

DOCTOR S363
I know.

PATIENT S363
That's horrible.

DOCTOR S363
Seriously.

PATIENT S363
Horrible.

DOCTOR S363
So what's new?

PATIENT S363
Well since I've last seen you I've had carpal tunnel done on my hands again.

DOCTOR S363
You have okay. 

PATIENT S363
Uh-huh.  That's still uh.

DOCTOR S363
Feeling better?

PATIENT S363
No but that's the end of it.  But I've had it done three times in each hand.

DOCTOR S363
I know.

PATIENT S363
And this time they had to open my hands up and they said this is the last time to do it.  I own my age and the size of my hands.

DOCTOR S363
Anything else new?

PATIENT S363
Oh just once in the summer I was a little dizzy with the heat but that was at.

DOCTOR S363
Did you get, did you have to go to the hospital?

PATIENT S363
Uh yes I did.  I went and had a stress test and everything, my heart doctor.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.

PATIENT S363
And they checked it out and that was about it and I've had a sleep test.

DOCTOR S363
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S363
And I guess I'm gonna go see a sleep doctor.  Whatever, what do they call it again?

DOCTOR S363
Sleep apnea?

PATIENT S363
Sleep apnea yes and one of the heart doctors thought that might be a part of my heart.  I have a little bleep in my heart all the time and so that's what they said to do that.

DOCTOR S363
To do what?

PATIENT S363
Have a sleep test.

DOCTOR S363
Did you have the sleep test already?

PATIENT S363
Yes I've had that done.

DOCTOR S363
And it says that you have sleep apnea?

PATIENT S363
Well no I haven't met with the man that read the test yet.

DOCTOR S363
Oh, gotcha.

PATIENT S363
That's within a week or two I go meet with him.

DOCTOR S363
Gotcha.

PATIENT S363
But the one heart doctor, a different doctor that reads some of the things he says take the magnesium and I've been taking magnesium and it helps.

DOCTOR S363
For what?

PATIENT S363
You need it in your system, it helps you.  So now I feel a lot better.

DOCTOR S363
Okay.  What is it?

PATIENT S363
But the heat was the big problem.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.

PATIENT S363
This summer was horrible.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.

PATIENT S363
But other than that I'm fine.  My arthritis is killing me but otherwise what are you gonna do.

DOCTOR S363
Are you taking anything for it?

PATIENT S363
Just the meloxicam is for the arthritis.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.  Oh right but you have to take that.

PATIENT S363
Oh yes I take all my medications.

DOCTOR S363
Does it help?

PATIENT S363
I hope so.

DOCTOR S363
Okay.

PATIENT S363
I mean nothings gonna do, make it that perfect anymore.

DOCTOR S363
And you have another outside primary care doctor is that right?

PATIENT S363
Uh I have my family doctor; it's been 40 years DOCTOR in Villa Park.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah okay.

PATIENT S363
And then a heart doctor which is DOCTOR in Elmhurst Hospital.

DOCTOR S363
And he's the one that gave you the magnesium?

PATIENT S363
That's a lady.  Pardon?

DOCTOR S363
Sheâ€™ the one that gave you the magnesium, is she the one that gave you the magnesium?

PATIENT S363
Uh it was another one of the heart doctors that she referred to.

DOCTOR S363
Okay.

PATIENT S363
Cause he read, he looked into why I got the beep in my heart.  They all know that.  I've had it for years.  Everybody thinks like, when they take my blood pressure or something or whatever it is when they listen to my heart they always probably get a little beep, a little jump or something.

DOCTOR S363
Huh.

PATIENT S363
See so but, but I've had that for years and years and years.

DOCTOR S363
But no new chest pain or anything like that?

PATIENT S363
No, none of that no.  There was one thing I asked last time.

DOCTOR S363
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S363
And doggone it again, why can't we get montelukast.  That's for my asthma?  I can't get a 90 day fill on it.  It's only 30 day fill so that's 12 times a year I gotta keep calling for that one thing.  That's a lot of postage and then we damn waste it.

DOCTOR S363
Did I order it?

PATIENT S363
Yeah everything is 90 days.

DOCTOR S363
I changed it.

PATIENT S363
I know you did but it still comes 30.

DOCTOR S363
I don't know why.

PATIENT S363
It comes in one bottle.

DOCTOR S363
I've changed it again.

PATIENT S363
Yeah it comes and the last time, the last one I ran low and I called in and it says oh it's over with and it wasn't over with.

DOCTOR S363
Huh.  Hmm.  I'm sorry about that.  I keep changing it on my end and I already had changed it.

PATIENT S363
Well it only comes in, they send me the exact bottle and it comes that way with only 30 tablets in it.

DOCTOR S363
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S363
Like you know so it's a sealed bottle.  But I get most of the medications in larger quantities just break them down.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.  And your stress test this summer was negative?

PATIENT S363
Yeah everything was fine.  Yeah oh yeah.  I've had all of that.

DOCTOR S363
And you got your labs done today.

PATIENT S363
Yeah.  You got any report on that yet?

DOCTOR S363
There well your CBC looks fine.

PATIENT S363
How about the cholesterol I tried.

DOCTOR S363
That's still pending so.

PATIENT S363
Oh cause I fight with that.  Oh I don't fight; I try to keep it real low.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.

PATIENT S363
The heart doctors want it low and I've been doing it.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.

PATIENT S363
But I'm very faithful with all of my medications.  I take them exact like I'm supposed to.

DOCTOR S363
I believe you.  Well your blood pressure looks good.

PATIENT S363
Uh-huh.  I still go three days a week to the hospital and exercise.

DOCTOR S363
Good.

PATIENT S363
At Elmhurst Hospital.

DOCTOR S363
Good.

PATIENT S363
Cardiac rehab I've been doing that for 12 years now.  It's a hard nut to crack but I still do it.  And we open up the hospital at 6:30 in the morning so I got to get up at 5:30 to do that.

DOCTOR S363
Take a seat up here my friend let me take a quick look at you.

PATIENT S363
Alright.  You'll probably hear the little bleep.  Oh then another thing that the sleep test is, my heart gets real slow sometimes when I sleep.

DOCTOR S363
Does it?

PATIENT S363
It drops real low yes.

DOCTOR S363
Like how low?

PATIENT S363
Uh 38, I think once the heartbeat was 38.

DOCTOR S363
Big deep breaths for me.  

PATIENT S363
And these, at the hospital every time we used a machine or anything.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.

PATIENT S363
We used one of these cleaning things and I store them in my pocket and I haven't had a cold now in four or five years.

DOCTOR S363
Oh really.

PATIENT S363
Yes.

DOCTOR S363
That's better than I've done.

PATIENT S363
Oh I've been lucky and I wash my hands 100 times a day and I use that what's you're doing there.

DOCTOR S363
Good.

PATIENT S363
Yeah.  No swelling of the legs or feet or anything.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.  Well that's good.

PATIENT S363
The only thing is I just bruise a lot more now in my older age.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.

PATIENT S363
A lot more bruising but other than that.  But.

DOCTOR S363
Are you still using the Albuterol a couple times a week?

PATIENT S363
The albuterol I, not really, yeah maybe once or twice a day maybe.

DOCTOR S363
Once or twice a day?

PATIENT S363
Yes.  And when I was in the hospital for that check-up, they take that away from you and I says well they gave me, this is what I used to have years ago.  This was from hospital and this has both.  This is kind of like a preventive and a helper.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.

PATIENT S363
It was a double but albuterol is just for emergency.  What was the other one?  Albuterol and I forget the name of the other one.  I used to have a double but then they had these years back.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah.

PATIENT S363
And this is what the hospital gave me for the day I was in there.  They won't let you bring your own.

DOCTOR S363
Really oh.

PATIENT S363
Oh yeah when you go in there right.

DOCTOR S363
Yeah I could see that.

PATIENT S363
You can't bring your own medications.

DOCTOR S363
That's true.  Let me go talk to the other doctors I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT S363

DOCTOR S363
I'm gonna check with them and I'll be right back to you so I'm gonna take your medication list.

PATIENT S363

PATIENT S363

DOCTOR S363
And what I will do is follow up on these labs when they return and send you a letter with them cause it might take a while before they come back with your lipids.

PATIENT S363
