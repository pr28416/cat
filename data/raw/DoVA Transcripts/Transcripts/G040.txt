Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR G040
PATIENT?  

PATIENT G040
I get along, how are you today?

DOCTOR G040
Good.  You survived everything since the last time I saw you.

PATIENT G040
Well I have intermittently.

DOCTOR G040
Well I hope we were able to help you out there with everything that's happened.  Good.  I’m over this way.

PATIENT G040
I'm able to lie in bed and breathe more.

DOCTOR G040
Good.  Okay that's when it was happening at night.  @@@ maybe it's just heartburn but we should get it checked anyway.  

PATIENT G040
Oh my God, @@@ extended an area so @@@ and it works like a champ as I say.

DOCTOR G040
Good.  How are you with your activities?

PATIENT G040
Increasing.  Yeah, not earth-shaking now but.

DOCTOR G040
Good.

PATIENT G040
Um, timely enough about a month ago my car broke.  

DOCTOR G040
Okay.

PATIENT G040
And I can't afford to fix it yet.  I'll get it fixed next week, payday comes in next week and uh that doesn't mean I don't have a car.  I just do my running around in the evenings when my daughter's home or on the weekends.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.

PATIENT G040
Or I put my two little flat things and I hoof it off because there's a large mall two blocks from our house.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.

PATIENT G040
So if I had, I have not gone there, why?  There's no reason, nothing you need over there and uh the evil is every fast food place you could think of in the world is within a half mile of our house so I can go eat something grubby instead of eating good out of the refrigerator.  But uh overall I have some stuff I want to talk to you about today.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.

PATIENT G040
Uh and number one I have, I don't know what it is but if I stretch my out and then pull on something I get sharp burning pains through the upper arm.  I don't know.  At one time I think I was told tendinitis, I don't know if that's what it is.

DOCTOR G040
How long has this been going on?

PATIENT G040
It's been bothering me now for about a month.  

DOCTOR G040
And that's when you, like this or like this?

PATIENT G040
Yeah, when I okay, I can go from straight up, up to there and it starts to get painful.

DOCTOR G040
And show me exactly where is the pain?

PATIENT G040
Right in here.

DOCTOR G040
Right here?

PATIENT G040
Primarily here but it will run down almost to the elbow.

DOCTOR G040
And it never goes past the elbow?

PATIENT G040
No not past the elbow.

DOCTOR G040
You can extend it down.  Does that hurt?

PATIENT G040
Uh, hurt no, uncomfortable yes.

DOCTOR G040
Okay I'm gonna push, resist me okay.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
How is that, okay?

PATIENT G040
Downward it doesn't bother it okay.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.

PATIENT G040
That doesn't bother anyway.

DOCTOR G040
Okay it's not a rotator cuff so that's fine okay.

PATIENT G040
I'm not a jock; you got to be a jock to have that.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah you never know.

PATIENT G040
I don't know, when you get old, I found out today I had cataracts.

DOCTOR G040
You know everybody gets cataracts eventually.

PATIENT G040
I know.

DOCTOR G040
Are they going to operate?

PATIENT G040
Well, he says you have the beginnings.  Everybody tells you inside of the next four years that you need them fixed, tell them to stick it.

DOCTOR G040
Good.

PATIENT G040
So they're just.  The first time anybody's ever mentioned it.

DOCTOR G040
Eventually, when you, when they'll probably need to be fixed, you'll probably know it cause things will start looking yellow.

PATIENT G040
A little fuzzy.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.

PATIENT G040
My wife was an ophthalmic technician.

DOCTOR G040
Ah.

PATIENT G040
So when you get into the eyeball side of things we spent many years.  I used to be her prepper and quiz her for questions when she had to take a test.

DOCTOR G040
I know they ask you @@2@

PATIENT G040
And so me and the eyeball get together probably better than anything else other than maybe heart and the little bit because of my involvement with that.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.

PATIENT G040
That was complaint number one.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.

PATIENT G040
Number two, it has been brought to my attention that I couldn't hear a board hit me up the side of the head according to my daughter.

DOCTOR G040
That you're deaf?

PATIENT G040
Huh?

DOCTOR G040
And she said it's not selective hearing is it?

PATIENT G040
Well I tried to explain that once to her but it worked as well as when my wife explained it, no, no, that's genetic, women get it, men don't.  Oh yes dear.

DOCTOR G040
Well I heard that usually @@@.

PATIENT G040
I know and you know how I, you know what are you married?

DOCTOR G040
Yes.

PATIENT G040
You try that on your wife and it doesn't work very well.

DOCTOR G040
You got blood drawn today, well let me check your hearing here in a second and then we'll review all your labs today too.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
Which actually look excellent.  Whatever you're doing, you're doing it all right okay.  Um.

PATIENT G040
What is this my chemical one?

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.  Your cholesterol perfect, its right where you need to be so you're going to significantly reduce and prevent your risk of any further events.

PATIENT G040
Good.  We have to talk about another subject than that subject too than that.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.  Let me check the hearing real quick.  Why don't you have a seat up here because I need to look inside.  

PATIENT G040
My father, in the second World War was in the Army artillery.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.

PATIENT G040
Boom, boom, boom.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.

PATIENT G040
So I grew up as a teenager with dad being halfway close to stone deaf.  That meant the TV was turned way up and you had to yell to get his attention.

DOCTOR G040
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G040
Well then he went to retire in 1959 from the Army after 20 years and then I said well maybe your ears need to have a look and they had come up with an operation where they took all those little pieces matter.

DOCTOR G040
Sure.

PATIENT G040
And you of course know, you don't know @@@ stir up etc.  

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.

PATIENT G040
You know about that long @@@ but they could push him back together.

DOCTOR G040
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G040
Well they did that and then they sent the old fart home.  And the first day he's home, I walked and said hey dad how you doing, you shout at me again and I'll break your legs.  Oh shit, does this mean I got to be quiet?

DOCTOR G040
It worked.

PATIENT G040
Yeah it worked like a champ but it took a long time.  I had three younger brothers, between the four of us, for us not to come storming in the house yelling.

DOCTOR G040
Cause you were conditioned.

PATIENT G040
Oh my God.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.  You were trained already to try to.

PATIENT G040
I told my mother well you know we learned okay and she was an RN so.

DOCTOR G040
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G040
She understood that but dad didn't.

DOCTOR G040
You've never been exposed to loud noises have you?

PATIENT G040
Flying the jet airplanes in the Navy.

DOCTOR G040
You did okay.  Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT G040
Up yeah.

DOCTOR G040
So you've got a risk of this too.  Okay no wax in this one and do you think there's one here that's worse than the other?

PATIENT G040
If I were pick the right one is probably.  I take a Q-Tip and I don't go shoving it in there.  I'll just to this front level.

DOCTOR G040
That's perfect.

PATIENT G040
And take it around and around.  Every once in a while I come with a hunk of wax; sometimes I come out with absolutely nothing.

DOCTOR G040
There is zero wax in there right now, it looks good.  Never push it any further than where you push it now.

PATIENT G040
No, no.

DOCTOR G040
Good.

PATIENT G040
Those are inside parts, we mustn't mess with any of those.

DOCTOR G040
Close your eyes for me.  Do you hear noises?

PATIENT G040
Yes I hear a high-pitched squeal.  

DOCTOR G040
Really?

PATIENT G040
Oh you're thumping your finger over it but I saw it so that's not fair.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.  Did you not hear it?

PATIENT G040
Could not hear it before I opened my eyes no.  Now I can hear your right, your left, I could hear the right.

DOCTOR G040
But not the left huh.  You can open again.  I might as well finish examining you since you're here and I need to.

PATIENT G040
Alright.

DOCTOR G040
What else is on your mind?

PATIENT G040
When I first started getting this.  Five years ago I had this stuff and my daughter was gonna see a chiropractor.  Well I have Medicare so I get to go see him.  I get 24 adjustments off him.  @@@.  He didn't, just as bad now.  But he took x-rays as they do all around the spine.

DOCTOR G040
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G040
And he showed me the x-ray taken from the side in the abdominal area that had this little white tube in front above the spine.  He says you got calcification in your aorta.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.

PATIENT G040
And I said okay and he said tell your doctor that.  Consider yourself told.

DOCTOR G040
Have you ever smoked?

PATIENT G040
Uh for a week in 1962.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.  Now how old are you?

PATIENT G040
No I'm 67 next month or in February.

DOCTOR G040
You don't look 67, you look good um.

PATIENT G040
Living with Italian women.  I'd recommend it highly now.

DOCTOR G040
Well one thing I was gonna say is that if you were 65 and you had smoked before all the studies show that you qualify for an abdominal ultrasound to look for an aneurysm.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
That's what we worry about when we hear about calcifications.

PATIENT G040
Yeah.  I've got a good heart, if it's gonna go pop well that's a different story.

DOCTOR G040
That's a different, yeah because if it's an aneurysm.

PATIENT G040
Yeah immediately internally, immediately fatal is what it is.

DOCTOR G040
So I mean it, technically you don't qualify for that study.  If you wanted one I can order it for you.

PATIENT G040
I think, well let me ask you this, am I in serious trouble?

DOCTOR G040
Let me close this door.  Sorry, I just thought.

PATIENT G040
If this is something that's gonna make me jump off the roof I don't want to know about it.

DOCTOR G040
I saw people walking out there out of the corner of my eye.

PATIENT G040
I know.

DOCTOR G040
Um.

PATIENT G040
If it's something, you kind of like we jumped on the stent and everything and knocked that out real quick.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.

PATIENT G040
Okay.  I'm due in another six months or thereabouts to see DOCTOR or.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah DOCTOR.

PATIENT G040
Again as a cardiologist.  Well to me that's the tube that goes out of the heart.

DOCTOR G040
That is the aorta uh-huh.

PATIENT G040
And I would bring it up to him if I'm not putting myself in a hazardous place by not doing anything about it right now.

DOCTOR G040
I don't think you are.  I think, I have to look this up real quick.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
Because I know that if you're a smoker, I would immediately counsel doing the screening but you're not.  But you know that you have a history of blocked arteries already.

PATIENT G040
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR G040
I'm almost inclined to just get the test and make sure.

PATIENT G040
The car comes out of the shop on Wednesday, in theory.

DOCTOR G040
Okay well they can't do it today anyway.

PATIENT G040
I know.

DOCTOR G040
What's gonna happen is I think you have to be fasting beforehand so that there's no food content that's blocking the aorta.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
Okay, so let's plan on getting that tested.

PATIENT G040
I will read my mail closely and look for it.

DOCTOR G040
Very good.  You don't get belly pain or anything like that, okay.  I'll check for a second.  Seldomly, you can actually hear these things with a stethoscope or you can palpate them.  But we'd be in trouble if we're able to do that.

PATIENT G040
That would be, when the aneurysm is about as big as my fist.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.

PATIENT G040
Which means I'm going to lay down very carefully here while you go get someone to bring a gurney in here.

DOCTOR G040
That's what would happen.

PATIENT G040
And we'd head downstairs.

DOCTOR G040
Good.  Deep breaths.  Okay now let's have you lay down flat.  Everything sounds good so far.  Can you pull your shirt up for me PATIENT?  Okay.  And remind me what's this scar from?

PATIENT G040
Huh?

DOCTOR G040
Remind me what's this scar from?

PATIENT G040
Oh I had a quad bypass.

DOCTOR G040
Okay that's right you had a big, okay so.

PATIENT G040
It was supposed to be a three-fer but I got this used car salesman kind of pitch while they had it opened, they went ahead and did the fourth one.  It was a Loyola job.

DOCTOR G040
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G040
I’m a stray - I told DOCTOR that and he's like really.

DOCTOR G040
You know we're all from Loyola actually, although I chose to stay at Hines for the next year completely actually.  I don't really hear or feel anything so I think we're okay.  Kind of a lot of layers to go through though before I get to hear the aorta.

PATIENT G040
Be nice.  Be nice.  We're working on it.

DOCTOR G040
You have a garden. Yes.  It's the summer people typically lose weight in the summer.  It's always a challenge in the wintertime to figure out.

PATIENT G040
I don't think I've put anything on since I came back.

DOCTOR G040
Well let's see, you look good.  You really do.  

PATIENT G040
But I went out for my hike the other day and I took my 9-year-old and a 10-year-old out because I was house-sitting – kid-sitting, grandson sitting and his buddy and it was a great hike, about a mile by the time we got there and back but we stopped at Pizza Hut while we were out so there went the good of the walk.

DOCTOR G040
That's what.

PATIENT G040
But I only had, I had two small slices of pizza.  They ate most of the rest of it.

DOCTOR G040
Good.

PATIENT G040
So that I ate the next day is lunch.

DOCTOR G040
You know you can eat that stuff, it's all within reason.

PATIENT G040
Exactly.

DOCTOR G040
It's not terrible to eat that once.

PATIENT G040
When I was next door.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.

PATIENT G040
I had this, well this black gentleman from the south.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.

PATIENT G040
He was my roommate.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT G040
And I said you know there's a couple of things we got to work on to study because we had this dietician who was like if you drink one glass of whole milk you'll probably die before breakfast and I said yeah I'm one of these guys that believes in moderation and he said well you ought to be from the south and I said guess where my parents live.  They live in Bossier City, Louisiana and he says holy shit but long story short, we invented 95% fat free milk.  We were going to sell that and make a fortune.

DOCTOR G040
Really.

PATIENT G040
Yeah.  Do you know how many little old ladies my mother-in-law would have been alive?  She would have bought that stuff, 95% fat free? You can still but it for the same price as milk.  Cause you know what it is?  Just regular milk.  It's got 5% butterfat in it, that means that it's 95% fat free if my arithmetic's right.  I said we got about ten days to do this and then we gotta get out of the country.  And he told me I was dangerous and apparently made some smart-aleck comment to the nutritionist cause I got a long lecture the next time she came through.

DOCTOR G040
Oh no.  Well things are looking good okay.

PATIENT G040
Okay good.

DOCTOR G040
But I'm inclined to order that test for you.

PATIENT G040
Alright, let’s do that, when you get that set up can we do something about the hearing?

DOCTOR G040
And I'm going to order a Audiology consult for that also.

PATIENT G040
Super.

DOCTOR G040
So what they do is um they are going to do the, you do all this special hearing tests okay.

PATIENT G040
Yeah.

DOCTOR G040
And then I suspect though we're probably going to have to get an MRI or a CAT scan of the brain just because whenever there's an asymmetric hearing loss.

PATIENT G040
Yeah.

DOCTOR G040
People worry about the worst case scenario which would be a tumor um affecting the nerves there.  Affecting the nerve on that side okay.  

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
I always tell you about worst case scenarios.

PATIENT G040
Yeah, I'll throw myself in front of a car on the way home so.  I got nothing to lose.

DOCTOR G040
I mean.

PATIENT G040
I'm being facetious, you can see I'm having a good time with this thing today because I have, I feel good.

DOCTOR G040
I'm glad to see it yeah.

PATIENT G040
You know if you can't make me feel good because of this, that and whatever else then I worry about it and I'm sitting kind of, I know what it was.  One other thing.

DOCTOR G040
Yes.

PATIENT G040
Oh what do they call it?

DOCTOR G040
Oh and the shoulder also, um that.

PATIENT G040
That one I got to work on.

DOCTOR G040
That sounds like muscle and tendinitis.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
Um I think ibuprofen is good okay.

PATIENT G040
Uh ibuprofen and Keflex.

DOCTOR G040
Uh Keflex is an antibiotic.  Do you take it?

PATIENT G040
Then I'm not talking about Keflex then.  Plavix.

DOCTOR G040
Plavix.

PATIENT G040
Plavix yeah.

DOCTOR G040
There might, okay they worry about increased risks of bleeding, specifically in the GI tract.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
If you take your ibuprofen with food.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
And you don't take a lot of it, then it should be okay.  You know another option is Tylenol Arthritis that you can try too.  It's not as good as ibuprofen or Naproxen or meloxicam.

PATIENT G040
Well the big thing I was concerned was on my way out we were having a little chat about the do's and don'ts of being on Plavix and they said use the Tylenol or acetaminophen instead.

DOCTOR G040
Have you tried it for the pain for the shoulder?

PATIENT G040
Uh I got a bottle accidentally of Tylenol P.M.  It was about a week before my daughter said you know P.M. and I said @@@ you get P.M., its PMS you get and she says no look at it and I looked at it and said um I wondered why they were blue and grey pills but I.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah and that's not the color of Tylenol.

PATIENT G040
No uh yeah it helped at night sleeping cause that's when I and again when I.  

DOCTOR G040
Lift up.

PATIENT G040
How do I get @@@ pain in the butt line so I go outside and I open the car door, I get in and then I reach out and have to stretch to get the car door and then pull to pull it closed, oh man so.

DOCTOR G040
Let's try and you never injured yourself right?

PATIENT G040
I have not injured my shoulder no.

DOCTOR G040
All of a sudden this showed up right?  This is all of a sudden right?

PATIENT G040
Yeah it's just been maybe as I say a month that it came on.

DOCTOR G040
And you weren't doing something strenuous to bring it on?  I might get an x-ray too.  I don't think it's in the bone.  I'm pretty sure it's in the muscle or the tendon okay.  Um and then physical therapy is another option too, to go over exercises to stretch those muscles out.

PATIENT G040
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G040
I can certainly order that for you, if you don't mind coming in here once the car is fixed.

PATIENT G040
Well how often do I need to come in here for that?  You see we live 100 mile round trip.

DOCTOR G040
I know you're over in @@@ right?

PATIENT G040
Yeah.  Uh let's just take the medicine and see if it helps a little bit.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.

PATIENT G040
I.

DOCTOR G040
You want, Tylenol you said helped it right?

PATIENT G040
Yeah.

DOCTOR G040
Let's stick with the Tylenol.

PATIENT G040
I also take 325 mg of aspirin a day.

DOCTOR G040
That helps too.  That's an NSAID too that should help.  So let's do that.  If it's not getting better and there's an issue then we're going to do physical therapy okay.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
Then, I’m sure, by that time you're going to be more inclined to do something more aggressive then okay cause it was bothering you more.  Okay and then we need to order a couple other things and then I have to check in with my boss here in the clinic, my attending and I'll be right back okay.  Um but your labs look great.

PATIENT G040
Magnesium is it in line, is it a little low?

DOCTOR G040
It is perfect, yours was 1.8, but let me double check that.  Yeah 1.8.  They put you on pills right?

PATIENT G040
Yeah I take 400 mg a day.

DOCTOR G040
That should be fine; 1.8 is fine.  If you have like heart arrhythmia, I would probably want you above 2 but I'm quite happy with where it is now.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
Alright.  (Someone comes to the door and the doctor speaks with them)

PATIENT G040
I have one more question.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT G040
Um probiotics, the little pill full.

DOCTOR G040
I know about the @@@.  I work with researchers on this one here at Hines actually so @@@.

PATIENT G040
My wife and my grandson or my daughter and my grandson are taking these things and I said no I can't hurt, I don't think.

DOCTOR G040
It doesn't hurt usually.

PATIENT G040
Okay.  Cause it did say there on the back if you're taking any other prescription meds check with your doctor so.

DOCTOR G040
No it won't hurt and if you're buying these like in yogurt and over-the-counter and stuff like that.

PATIENT G040
Yeah.

DOCTOR G040
Unfortunately they're usually all the bugs they put in there are usually all dead.

PATIENT G040
Yeah.

DOCTOR G040
Just to let you know.  There's very few that are actually truly regulating.

PATIENT G040
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G040
And very few that actually truly help and usually people mostly take probiotics for C. diff infection, which you have absolutely nothing to worry about with that.

PATIENT G040
I'm not going to do it, believe any of that. 

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.

PATIENT G040
They're on this diet and I'm the all American diet yeah.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah I don't think it adds anything to your heart either and if anything, honestly I think its expensive yogurt with dead bugs.

PATIENT G040
But we can wander down to Whole Foods which is in Stromberg and not that far from the house.

DOCTOR G040
If you want, I think Whole Food’s really expensive.

PATIENT G040
No it is but my daughter loves it and I just usually say great, when you go over there you're gonna end up picking up the tab and she'll say yeah let's go.

DOCTOR G040
Well if she's gonna pay for it.

PATIENT G040
Yeah.

DOCTOR G040
I'll be gone just a second okay.

PATIENT G040
I'm here.  I'm here.

DOCTOR G040
I'll be five minutes okay.

PATIENT G040
Sure.

(DOCTOR OUT:  79:35  DOCTOR IN:  85:25)

DOCTOR G040
Ok let me put in the order and right before you go.  We're gonna do everything like we discussed so okay.  So we'll get you an ultrasound.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
You're gonna go to the ear doctor.  We don't need any imaging for this unless it gets bad and then you give me a call.

PATIENT G040
I'll do that.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.  Um and then I think that's it right?

PATIENT G040
Blood sugar.

DOCTOR G040
The blood sugar was fine, you're not diabetic.  6.3 is the hemoglobin A1c that was checked today and it stayed there.  When it becomes 6.5.

PATIENT G040
I'm diabetic.  Well I'm going to have to come a little less weight and I got up about a week and a half ago in the night.  I get up at 6 in the morning and I go down and about every other day or every third day I take my blood sugar.  It was 104, where the hell that come from you know.  I had a piece of cake after supper last night, I was at 104 and it's been 104, 105, I get 120 and it went back down to 104 the next day, this last week cause I took every day this week.  But it's floating along at 105 and I know that's chemically induced but um I need to stay on the medication I'm on.

DOCTOR G040
Right.  But you're just on metformin.  If you were like on insulin we could titrate that stuff down but you're just on metformin.  If you get low blood sugar give me a call.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
That's like less than 80s and if you get episodes or you're symptomatic.

PATIENT G040
Metformin is the only drug I have that is for diabetes?

DOCTOR G040
Yeah.

PATIENT G040
That I just. @@@.

DOCTOR G040
Oh you're on glipizide too aren't you?

PATIENT G040
Yeah.

DOCTOR G040
Okay um 104 is pretty good, that's first thing in the morning right?

PATIENT G040
Right.

DOCTOR G040
Fasting.

PATIENT G040
Yeah.

DOCTOR G040
That's pretty good.  If you're ever less than 80 give me a call and we're stopping glipizide and you’ll just be on metformin.

PATIENT G040
Okay.

DOCTOR G040
Okay.  So actually that's your goal, to come off of the glipizide.  But everything looks good.  If you lose weight this summer, I guarantee we'll stop the glipizide @@@.

PATIENT G040
Yeah I if I take it off then we'll dump this that and whatever else and get Lipitor on, whatever the long chemical name is for generic Lipitor.

DOCTOR G040
Simvastatin.

PATIENT G040
The uh, I'm sorry.

DOCTOR G040
It is simvastatin.

PATIENT G040
That's what I'm on right now.  Is that.

DOCTOR G040
I don't remember if that's Lipitor, I only go with generics, I actually don't remember.

PATIENT G040
Uh DOCTOR said he was looking at Crestor.

DOCTOR G040
He did mention that.

PATIENT G040
And then I never heard a word back on that uh you guys don't handle it here but that's alright because you don't handle Plavix here.  You hand blood @@@ or whatever it is.

DOCTOR G040
Clopidogrel. 

PATIENT G040
Huh?

DOCTOR G040
Clopidogrel.

PATIENT G040
Yeah.  Except that it comes in a bottle that says Plavix and when I asked the Walgreens pharmacist he says there is no generic out for Plavix, it came out and it was pulled off the market.  Well you guys apparently decided you're gonna do it so you're giving me Plavix, I said that here, I'll deny it if ever goes out there in a discussion because it's making me work and I like it.

DOCTOR G040
Yeah but hold on just a second real quick.

PATIENT G040
Sure.  I'll shut up too.

DOCTOR G040
Alright these things are sent and we'll see you in a couple months.  We'll check labs again just like today, alright?.  Here you go sir.

PATIENT G040
Is everything in order?

DOCTOR G040
Yep, nice to seeing you doing so well.

PATIENT G040
Great to feel the way I have today although I kind hoped I’d got rid of the giant pupils.

DOCTOR G040
Oh you're dilated.

PATIENT G040
Dilated, yeah.

DOCTOR G040
Take care okay.

PATIENT G040
Okay and I just go right over here.

DOCTOR G040
@@@ uh-huh.
