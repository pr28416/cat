DOCTOR X848
Okay.  And you're taking the medicine for your cholesterol?

PATIENT X848

PATIENT X848
Nothing but my stomach was killing me when you know me, if I don't have that uh bowel movement, at the bottom of my stomach.

DOCTOR X848
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X848
But after that fifth day I said no I went and got me some of them little old pills.

DOCTOR X848
You want me to put some in?

PATIENT X848
Yeah, yeah put them in and that's all I want.  Don't put nothing else in there.

DOCTOR X848
Okay.

PATIENT X848
‘Cuz I have to pay for that stuff. Put as big as they come.

DOCTOR X848
Yeah I put um 90 day supply with three refills and you can take one or two tablets.

PATIENT X848
Huh?

DOCTOR X848
It comes, the prescription will say take two tablets as needed and they'll come with you know 180 but you can take one or two as needed.

PATIENT X848
In other words, you get 180 in the box?

DOCTOR X848
Correct.

PATIENT X848
Yeah that's good.  I usually take two about 9 o'clock at night, the next morning really.

DOCTOR X848
You're due to see the eye doctor too.

PATIENT X848

DOCTOR X848

PATIENT X848

DOCTOR X848
Yeah.

PATIENT X848
Okay I better go up there and get a date then.  That's the only one?

DOCTOR X848
Yeah that's the next one.

PATIENT X848
In May.

DOCTOR X848
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X848
Do it said a date?

DOCTOR X848
Just any time in May.  Any time that works for you.  You can set it up today I think.

PATIENT X848
Yeah I'll go up there, but that still on the, no that's on the fifth floor ain't it.

DOCTOR X848
I'm not exactly sure.

PATIENT X848
Yeah I think it is.  It's about time for me to get a foot doctor, see the foot doctor too.

DOCTOR X848
You saw him in February and.

PATIENT X848
I saw the foot doctor in February?

DOCTOR X848
You actually saw, who did you see, you saw a nurse at the Foot Clinic.

PATIENT X848
Yeah that's uh.

DOCTOR X848
You saw the foot doctor in November.  Yeah they wanted you to come back as well so we can schedule that too.

PATIENT X848
Foot doctor okay, that's on the 7th floor.

DOCTOR X848
Uh-huh.  Now in @@@@, you had a colonoscopy um let's see.  You haven't noticed any blood in your stool or black tarry stool or weight loss or anything like that?

PATIENT X848
The only time I see blood in the stool is when I'm going to pass and it's too hard my hemorrhoids.

SECOND PERSON X848
@@@.

PATIENT X848
You know the hemorrhoids but after that.

DOCTOR X848
Cause what I'm trying to figure out if you've had your colonoscopy in @@@@ uh about six years ago showed a couple polyps and they were removed and they were the least dangerous kind of polyps but at that time your, the doctors thought you might, the colonoscopy doctor thought you might need to get a repeat colonoscopy yet last year or this year you know depending on how your overall health is.  I think your overall health is pretty good um.  You've got some heart disease but um you know you're lungs are okay.  I think you should, would be able to tolerate a colonoscopy um, if that's something you wished to pursue.

PATIENT X848
No, no.

DOCTOR X848
No okay.

PATIENT X848
That's the thing they go up your rectum.

DOCTOR X848
Yeah.

PATIENT X848
No I don't want to go through that no more.

DOCTOR X848
Okay.  I think that's reasonable.  I mean you're 84, you're pretty healthy.  The benefits would be catching a cancer early um.  If you notice any unexplained weight loss, fevers, chill, you know, sweats, weight loss anything like that or if you notice?

PATIENT X848
Sweats.

DOCTOR X848
Your stool changing.  Huh.

PATIENT X848
I sweat all the time.

DOCTOR X848
Like unexplained sweats or weight loss.

PATIENT X848
No.

DOCTOR X848
Okay uh, so your weight's been pretty stable.  So or if you notice tarry stool and it would be black like the color of this um.  Let me take a listen to you.  Deep breath and I'll listen to your heart.  Would you be willing to get some blood work done today, checking your A1c, your diabetes?

PATIENT X848
Huh?

DOCTOR X848
Would you be willing to check some blood today?

PATIENT X848
It don't matter.

DOCTOR X848
Okay, alright.  I think we should check that um, let me talk with DOCTOR and you'll be all set okay.

PATIENT X848
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  25:18  DOCTOR IN:  28:21)

DOCTOR X848
Alright, you're all set um give this to them up front and we're just gonna check that diabetes lab.  We'll get you to the eye doctors and foot doctors.  

PATIENT X848

DOCTOR X848

PATIENT X848
Okay uh now you don't, the pharmacist got this?

DOCTOR X848
