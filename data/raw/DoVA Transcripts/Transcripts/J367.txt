Do you have a TV in your room?

PATIENT J367
No.  TV is out in the front.  I can't sleep with the TV.

DOCTOR J367
Okay, alright.  So a big part of sleeping right is uh you know is like getting into the habit.  You're training your mind and your body to get into a habit so, things that you are doing, which is good, no TV in the room.

PATIENT J367
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J367
Your room is for sleep only.

PATIENT J367
Right.

DOCTOR J367
You go, you lay down, you don't fall asleep within 20 minutes, get up, do something but you know, they say, get out of bed, go sit in a chair, go try to read a book till you get tired and then go back to bed.

PATIENT J367
Yeah I do that.  I read books you know.

DOCTOR J367
Okay.

PATIENT J367
I go in the room and read and read.

DOCTOR J367
Yes.

PATIENT J367
Try to go to sleep drowsy.

DOCTOR J367
Are you smoking, do you smoke?  Do you drink?

PATIENT J367
No I don't smoke.  I stopped drinking, in fact, in the last couple of months I've only had two beers.  But to be fair, I had a bad drinking problems and I came home so I just did cold turkey on my own.  I just stopped going out to bars.  I just stayed in and went through the sweats.  I didn’t drink, I didn’t drink to the point that I didn't need it anymore you know.  Mother and father were how come you don't go out so I'm trying to kick this drinking habit. 

DOCTOR J367
Okay.

PATIENT J367
That's why I came here you know.  Instead of going to Alcoholics Anonymous I'm gonna kick it myself without help and they say okay take your time you know.  When you get over it, get over it and.

DOCTOR J367
Are you over it?

PATIENT J367
Yeah I walk by liquor stores.  You know my father he drinks and uh he can't even get me to have a drink with him.  The last drink I had was New Years and it was a can of beer, took me over an hour to drink it so.  That much cause I was reading in this book uh Natural Energy that I got from the VA Hospital in Bettendorf and a lot of the symptoms in that book I exhibit like uh the tiredness all the time and the lack of sleep and uh the @@@ but it's hard for me to think.  So I'm going through a VA program right now to help veterans get jobs and support them and stuff and uh I got to stop and think, you see what I'm saying.  The book talks about brain fog and not having enough energy cause I'm older now and I just, I'm turning 53 next week and it's saying that maybe starting supplements like @@@ and CQ10.

DOCTOR J367
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J367
Could help get rid of that and following a diet.  I got the book with me and it's a lot of stuff in the book I was gonna talk to the doctor and see if I can get some of that.  Is that a possibility?

DOCTOR J367
So yeah I mean we can get you vitamins.  They don't have like all the you know newer CQ10 and all that.

PATIENT J367
No.

DOCTOR J367
That's not available here.  You got to buy that over-the-counter.

PATIENT J367
Oh okay.

DOCTOR J367
Um we've got multivitamins which I'd be happy to give you.

PATIENT J367
Yeah.

DOCTOR J367
Um but yeah.  That's um yeah you're kind of on your own on that.

PATIENT J367
Oh okay.

DOCTOR J367
I mean there's a couple of things, I can put in a prescription for a multivitamin but like CQ10 I know we don't have.

PATIENT J367
Okay you know @@@ to @@@. I believe I’m pronouncing it right.

DOCTOR J367
The only vitamins that the VA offers are vitamin D, folic acid, B12 um, ergocalciferol um well it's basically a multivitamin which has you know a bunch of different vitamins in it you know like your basic stuff vitamin C, A, you know those types of things.  Uh but CQ10 and I'm not sure what the other one is.

PATIENT J367
Uh-huh.  @@@ that I'm talking about.  I can show you the book.

DOCTOR J367
Oh yeah.

PATIENT J367
I got it with me.  So definitely need the lisinopril.  The VA sent me a little machine to check my blood pressure.

DOCTOR J367
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J367
And yesterday it was 109, 146/109.

DOCTOR J367
Yeah, you gotta get back on blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT J367
To help me go to sleep.  There you go.  Under chapter 4.  

DOCTOR J367
@@@.

PATIENT J367
@@@ that's what I thought; it's what they call natural energy.

DOCTOR J367
It’s an old book.

PATIENT J367
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR J367
1998, that's.

PATIENT J367
And now I see commercials where they're putting that in medications.

DOCTOR J367
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT J367
CQ10 is @@@.  I'm following the diet in there.

DOCTOR J367
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J367
But uh I check my weight I was like 245.

DOCTOR J367
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J367
I'm 226 now.

DOCTOR J367
Alright.  

PATIENT J367
Could I get sleep aids?

DOCTOR J367
Yeah.  Um what time do you get up in the morning?

PATIENT J367
Different times, like the last two weeks I've been setting my alarm to get up at 6:30 cause I have to be at this program I'm in and I got to be there at 9 o'clock.

DOCTOR J367
No drug use?

PATIENT J367
No drug use.  I stopped @@@.

DOCTOR J367
@@@.  Other things that can affect your sleep, depression.

PATIENT J367
Yeah I know I'm, I'm depressed right now cause I'm looking for work and uh going on interviews and so far nothing.  Pushing I mean it's like, still every day I have to push myself to get out of bed.  You know I'm always tired all the damn time.

DOCTOR J367
Do you have another appointment for Psychiatry?

PATIENT J367
That what I said I did and I didn't, last time I was here to see the doctor I got here too late but the guy you set it up and I didn't make it.

DOCTOR J367
Okay.  Well call back and set that up okay.  Cause if you know I want to help you with the sleep.

PATIENT J367
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J367
But I want you know if the sleep, you're not gonna sleep because of depression which is extremely common, okay and that's extremely common then we need to deal with the depression.  I don't want to give you sleeping pills and you know because sleeping pills, sleeping pills are like you know honestly one of the last things that I like to give people because it's a band-aid many times.  It's not, you know it's like what I mean by that is we're not getting to the root of the problem.  As soon as you stop taking the sleeping pills you're gonna have trouble with sleep again if we don't get to the why you're not getting good sleep.  If it's depression then we should treat the depression.

PATIENT J367
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J367
Because sleeping pills aren't gonna do anything for the depression.

PATIENT J367
Oh.

DOCTOR J367
If I give you sleeping pills, you might, I might as well say well you're gonna be on these pills for the rest of your life.

PATIENT J367
Oh okay, I just thought it was the other way around you know.

DOCTOR J367
No, no, no.

PATIENT J367
If you.

DOCTOR J367
You know I mean, I don't know but I think it's very possible that your sleeping is you know it's insomnia, your difficulty sleeping is secondary to depression.

PATIENT J367
Okay.

DOCTOR J367
You know I mean you've got good sleep habits.  You go to bed at the same time, you don't have a TV.

PATIENT J367
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J367
Uh you don't drink like coffee before you go to bed.

PATIENT J367
No, no.

DOCTOR J367
You don't have caffeine.

PATIENT J367
When I get up in the morning.

DOCTOR J367
Yeah but not, you know, not before bed so those are kind of the simple things that we can do um you know.  There are others, there is a long list of reasons as to why people don't get to sleep but you know depression is a very, very, we see this all the time.  You know it's actually more common to see someone with depression who has problems with sleep than someone who doesn't and then we see people who sleep too much.

PATIENT J367
Okay.

DOCTOR J367
Cause they're always tired.

PATIENT J367
Right.

DOCTOR J367
So I mean you know I don't mind giving you something for sleeping pills but I want you to be on the same page with me that.

PATIENT J367
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J367
This is not gonna be a permanent thing.  I don't want to keep giving you sleeping pills; prescription, you know what I'm saying?
