DOCTOR B610
PATIENT?

PATIENT B610
Here you be.

DOCTOR B610
Come on back.

PATIENT B610
@@@.

DOCTOR B610
I'm DOCTOR.  I don't know if you remember me.  We had met last time in uh see December.

PATIENT B610
December @@@.

DOCTOR B610
Uh December the 4th.  Yeah on December the 31st you saw a different doctor uh in the Urgent Care Clinic.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
And I understand you had some burning or you had some discharge?

PATIENT B610
Yeah.

DOCTOR B610
Have you got any more of that?

PATIENT B610
No.

DOCTOR B610
No, it's all gone.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
And they gave you those antibiotics right that shot and the okay.  Have any discharge since then?

PATIENT B610
No.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.  Are you using protection when you.

PATIENT B610
I haven't had any.

DOCTOR B610
Haven't had it.

PATIENT B610
(Laughter).

DOCTOR B610
Just remember to use protection to be safe.  All the tests came back negative. I don’t know if DOCTOR called you and told you, the HIV, syphilis and uh gonorrhea and Chlamydia all came back negative okay.

PATIENT B610
Okay.

DOCTOR B610
So that's all good news.

PATIENT B610
I wasn't aware about @@@ like that but I was just concerned about the fact I'm @@@ heavy feeling.

DOCTOR B610
Right and no more of that burning?  Any burning when you urinate or anything?

PATIENT B610
No it wasn't burning, no it hadn't been burning.

DOCTOR B610
You don't burn.

PATIENT B610
@@@ just I wasn't sure what it was.

DOCTOR B610
What it was huh.

PATIENT B610
And make sure @@@.

DOCTOR B610
It's always good to check things out.  Better to be safe than sorry and find out later and things get worse so.  That's good you came in and I'm glad everything is better now and feeling better and just that there are no more issues.  Good thing is that the tests all came back negative as well.  Are you still, are you still taking that terazosin, the medicine you take for the prostate?

PATIENT B610
Yeah.

DOCTOR B610
Are you still having to get up at night or have you gotten any better?

PATIENT B610
Yeah uh-huh.  Sometimes like the night before last I was okay.  The night before that I only had every thirty minutes for just two hours or three hours.

DOCTOR B610
For two or three hours.

PATIENT B610
Yeah.  That's been uh I took a gallon jug, one of those water jubs is what it is and overnight I urinated about five or six times and I put a half a gallon in that and I urinated a half a gallon.  Then last night I didn't urinate but about maybe a quart.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.

PATIENT B610
But I think it could have been higher cause sometimes I drink more in the evenings than I do a lot of the day.  Maybe that could have been it too.

DOCTOR B610
So you drinking more in the evenings?

PATIENT B610
Sometimes, you know it all depends on my tastes.

DOCTOR B610
Sure.

PATIENT B610
Whatever goes.  

DOCTOR B610
Try as much as you can to limit your drinking at night so that you're not having to go to the bath.  That'll help things at night cause you are gonna have to know you have to get up once or twice and I advise drinking at night or close to around the time that you're gonna go to sleep is gonna make things worse in terms of you having to get up more frequently basically.

PATIENT B610
I don't urinate much in the daytime but.

DOCTOR B610
You don't urinate as much in the daytime.

PATIENT B610
I haven't and I don't know if it's because I'm moving around or but it seems like urinate less in the daytime.  Now if I drink, I don't drink anything but lemonade you know and like just plain water to mix it in with.  I just recently started using that crystal stuff, Crystal Light stuff.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.

PATIENT B610
Because it's sugar free stuff.

DOCTOR B610
Sugar free stuff okay.

PATIENT B610
And then I make that use that now.  I used to drink gin when I was drinking and so I cut back 60 to 50 so I stopped drinking then I just continued the lemonade and that's all I drink.  I don't drink clear water.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.

PATIENT B610
It was, I haven't drink clear water for 35-40 years.

DOCTOR B610
Okay, well its okay as long as you remember that sugar is gonna be bad for your diabetes.  So keep, you know use substitute stuff if you can instead of the real sugars cause that's gonna be bad for your diabetes.  Just remember just to limit your lemonade drinking uh at night.  Like you know two, three hours, you should just try to make two to three hours before you're gonna go to bed.  Let's say you go to bed at 10 o'clock you know, just say at 8 o'clock you cut off any drinking you unless you're really thirsty, take a little half glass something.  Like you know try to limit so that you're not having that problem that much at night.  That'll help things with the problem at night okay along with the terazosin just continue taking the terazosin.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
How about your other medicines?  You having any problems with any other medicines?  No.  You been taking them fine or problems taking them at all?

PATIENT B610
Yeah I'm only on the one drop now on the my eye medicine.

DOCTOR B610
Eye medicine.

PATIENT B610
It's just my blood pressure pills @@@ I been sort of been taking.  I wasn't taking any blood pressure medicine in a month.

DOCTOR B610
You haven't taken any blood pressure medicine for a month why?

PATIENT B610
Because of my blood pressure it hasn't been up and I was taking it and I was taking you know where I got the monitor and if it went down to a certain amount don't take the blood pressure medicine and I haven't, when I started I was taking it it was down, it would be down low or something like that I didn't take the blood pressure medicine and my blood pressure machine hasn't been working for the last two weeks like it's really not bad or something @@@.  But I still have to wait and see.  My blood pressure is still okay now so.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.

PATIENT B610
I have never had blood pressure problems until this year and when I started having a problem with the stent and everything.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
That's when the blood pressure began to I guess, I think that's when it started going up I'm not sure.  Now it's down.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah you may never have had super high blood pressure but now with the stent in your heart, which means that you've had some heart disease, we tend to want to control your blood pressure better because if your blood pressure's even a little bit above where we want it at or above where our goal is, it can put pressure, strain on your heart and you know your heart's already had strain with the stent and things like that so the idea to prevent you from having any heart attack in the future with controlling your blood pressure will prevent that you know.  So what is your blood, you said you're checking your blood pressure at home, do you check it every day or do you check it?

PATIENT B610
I haven't checked it @@@ weeks.

DOCTOR B610
Last few weeks but before that were you checking it every day?

PATIENT B610
Yes.

DOCTOR B610
And so every day what would your pressure be?  What was the top number reading and what was the bottom number reading?

PATIENT B610
Sometimes it was, shoot, I should have, I didn't bring the thing that I wrote down.  Kind of hard to say because sometimes it'd be 99.

DOCTOR B610
Uh-huh.

PATIENT B610
Over 70 or something like that.

DOCTOR B610
Uh-huh.

PATIENT B610
Sometimes it might be the highest reading maybe was I think 110.

DOCTOR B610
For the top number the highest it ever was 110?

PATIENT B610
Yeah.

DOCTOR B610
The numbers okay and the bottom one numbers 70?

PATIENT B610
Yeah in there, sometimes maybe 80.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.  Um so 110/80 was probably the highest you ever noticed it?

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
And you check it on your arm?

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
And does it fit proper, as far as the sizing and things?  Did they size it for you when you first got it?  You got the blood pressure machine from here or someplace else?

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.  

PATIENT B610
I guess the size they gave me was a medium.

DOCTOR B610
A medium cuff okay.  Uh okay.  Cause your blood pressures here they got 135/74 so the bottom number is pretty consistent with what you get at home.  The top number is 135, from what you're telling me it's probably higher than it's ever been when you've checked it at home.

PATIENT B610
Yeah.

DOCTOR B610
When they checked it.

PATIENT B610
Yeah they say it was 70, at the time at home it might range sometimes 10-15 degrees uh.

DOCTOR B610
Different than here.

PATIENT B610
Different.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
And so it will be, even if it was 110, it's gonna be in the 125 @@@.

DOCTOR B610
So like for you, to have the blood pressure goal for you, given that your heart history and given your fact that you have diabetes which is a risk factor for having heart attacks.

PATIENT B610
That's another thing that I know it is.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
You know.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah the diabetes.  But sometimes, sometimes these things like high blood pressure or diabetes sometimes we don't know we have it because we don't notice.  We don't have symptoms maybe.  We don't have, we just walk around with it, you don't know.  You may not feel different with your blood pressure lower or higher or your sugar higher or lower but cause sometimes it's only found later when they do testing labs, that thing or it's picked up on a lab or something like that.

PATIENT B610
Well do they find sugar who did the blood tests before, the last time?

DOCTOR B610
Yeah like uh they had in the past I believe but let's see when the last one they checked here.  You're not taking any medication for your.

PATIENT B610
For sugar.

DOCTOR B610
For sugar are you?  

PATIENT B610
I just been on it for about a month.

DOCTOR B610
Oh the metformin yeah.  Well your sugar was slightly high, it was 7 is one of the numbers we look at but it looks like the most recent we checked it was better, 6.4 which means that your blood sugar is fairly well controlled um.  That was in December when we checked it, 6.4.  So if you have diabetes it's uh likely that your diabetes is uh pretty fairly mild or fairly well controlled.

PATIENT B610
Hmm.

DOCTOR B610
Just going on this one medicine, it's like fairly well controlled.  Do you check your sugar at home?

PATIENT B610
No.

DOCTOR B610
You don't check it.  Do you have a meter?

PATIENT B610
No.

DOCTOR B610
They never gave you one?

PATIENT B610
No.

DOCTOR B610
Okay we can give you one and teach you how to use it.

PATIENT B610
I know how to use, like if you give me the new one they was talking about.  They got one that you just put it on and.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
It don't, you don't even have to prick the finger and stuff like that.

DOCTOR B610
Uh I don't know if they have that one, that type here.  Yeah the one that I think they use is where you prick your finger, it's like a standard one.  There is one that you prick like I think maybe in the arm something or the wrist.  You still have to get blood though so there's still pricking involved but they say.

PATIENT B610
Maybe so.

DOCTOR B610
So I don't think, I'm not sure if they have that kind here, I think it's more like a standard one.  But what I could do is if you just checked your sugar uh you know maybe once a day or once every other day or three times a week even and log your sugars in the mornings when you wake up, log your sugars or if you, if you're gonna do it in the evening do it two hours after you've eaten your meal.  Check your sugar, write them down, bring that log to me and we'll see your sugars and say well you're being so well controlled we may just take you off the medicine and see how you're controlled with just diet and exercise.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
You know um and we can check you not with our numbers, your diabetes numbers is the A1c number and that A1c number every diabetes person we aim to get that at 6 and the A1c is just an indication of how good your sugars have been over a period of about three months.  Your last one when we checked in December is 6.4 which is like really good.  That's close to 6.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
And you're pretty, that indicates that your diabetes is really well controlled, just on that metformin.  So you know sometimes we say that people have diet-controlled diabetes which means they may have uh a touch of high of what we you know may be high sugar as you hear it and they just control it with good diet and nutrition as well as some exercise.  So it's just important because with the heart history that you have with the stent, it's important that we make sure that your diabetes is well controlled and it does look like it is because that can be a risk factor for having a heart attack in the future.  Okay.  But your diabetes looks good so we'll set you up with a meter so you can just check some sugars so we can have a log to see if we maybe can have you off the medicine.

PATIENT B610
Okay.  I have to pick it up here?

DOCTOR B610
Yes.  The blood pressure, let's check what it was, the blood pressure I want to make sure.  We could do two things, one is I'd like to either and you tell me what you want to do, we can either have you, I'd like to either have you started back on the medicine, at least one of the blood pressure medicines.  If you don't want to take both of them, you take one and come back in two weeks and recheck your blood pressure and see how it is and see the results.  Or that's what I ideally like to do or we could just say you can come back in two weeks not taking any of your blood pressure medicines, just continue checking your blood pressure at home and get you maybe a new battery here and bring a log of your blood pressures and come back in two weeks, take your blood pressure again here in the clinic, see what it is.  If it's still high then we'll go back on the blood pressure medicines.  But I'd like to, either way I want you to come back in two weeks and have your blood pressure rechecked.

PATIENT B610
Okay I think I could do it.  Which one do you want?  The one I was told to take, I had a pill in the morning and I had a pill at night.

DOCTOR B610
Maybe let's just probably keep you on the lisinopril at least.

PATIENT B610
Lisinopril.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah so the one that you take half a tablet, you broke it in half.

PATIENT B610
And that one I was only taking it once.

DOCTOR B610
Once a day.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh that was in the daytime.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.  So uh let's just restart that.  You haven't been taking that or the metoprolol right?

PATIENT B610
Metoprolol no I only taking one.

DOCTOR B610
Okay let's just start with the lisinopril.  The lisinopril is actually good because it protects your kidneys for people who have diabetes so that's a good medicine plus a blood pressure medicine and you're on a really low dose, 10 mg uh.  I think I'd like to take one to just we can see you next week and then you can come back in two weeks and see what your blood pressure is.  If your top number, your goal for your top number is less than 130.  The goal for your bottom number is less than 80.  So your bottom number you're at goal, you're less than 80.  The top number today you're almost at goal.  If you were 130 or less you'd be at goal but you're 135 so you're slightly high.  So that's, your blood pressure is fairly well controlled.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
Having taken no medicines for about a month.

PATIENT B610
Okay.

DOCTOR B610
So maybe you don't need to be on the metoprolol and you may not even need to be you know on that high dose of the lisinopril.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
But we'll keep the lisinopril on and you know.

PATIENT B610
And then come back in two weeks.

DOCTOR B610
Yes sir.

PATIENT B610
Okay.

DOCTOR B610
How have you been feeling otherwise?  Any other problems, chest pain, shortness of breath?  No chest pain, no shortness of breath.  Any trouble walking?  Do you get short of breath, chest pain when you walk?

PATIENT B610
No.

DOCTOR B610
Or you exert yourself no.  Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, nothing like that?

PATIENT B610
No I take stool softeners so that takes care of that.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.

PATIENT B610
And I.

DOCTOR B610
Now the other thing that's very important, are you taking your aspirin and your Plavix?

PATIENT B610
Yes.

DOCTOR B610
Every day, you don't miss doses?

PATIENT B610
No.

DOCTOR B610
That's important cause that stent they put can get clogged up if you don't take your aspirin and your Plavix.

PATIENT B610
I take that.

DOCTOR B610
So make sure you take that okay.

PATIENT B610
I don't take, I don't @@@.  I need to go pee.  I think I got another appointment on the 26th in Cardiology.

DOCTOR B610
Cardiology yeah.

PATIENT B610
Cardiology so that'll be for my shoulders.  I'm slowly falling apart.

DOCTOR B610
Now how would you feel about and a lot of these medicines have been shown after someone's had a heart attack we put you on these medicines, the lisinopril and the metoprolol because they also protect people from having another heart attack.  So you may never have a very high blood pressure ever but the fact that these protect you from having another heart attack is part of the reason why we put you on it.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
So we may consider just putting you maybe back on the lisinopril and the metoprolol but just at a very low dose so that you get the protection uh from having another heart attack but you know your blood pressure, since your blood pressure is not very high um you know you may not need that right now @@@ so that may be an option that I will come back and talk to you about.  I'm just gonna run things by my boss but, but in either case we probably want you back to check your blood pressure.  And you can bring your machine in as well next time you come in, bring your machine and we can put batteries in it and uh I'll fix it up if we need to and uh we can also check your blood pressure with your machine in the clinic and see and compare and kind of put it together at the same time.  Deep breath in and out.  Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath.  And uh do you smoke at all?

PATIENT B610
No.

DOCTOR B610
No more smoking okay good.  And you're not drinking anymore?

PATIENT B610
Beg your pardon.

DOCTOR B610
You're not drinking anymore you said you stopped it.

PATIENT B610
No, no, no.  I haven't been drinking and I @@@.

DOCTOR B610
@@@.

PATIENT B610
When @@@ and I'm keeping my legs elevated like in the evening occasionally so.  Sometimes they get swollen, sometimes they don't.

DOCTOR B610
How's the shoulder?  Shoulder doing okay?

PATIENT B610
No.

DOCTOR B610
Same, same old, not better or different?

PATIENT B610
It's better than it was when I first hurt got it done, the first two shots.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.

PATIENT B610
But it still hurts.  Sometimes when I @@@ then I get something when I raise up to use it, and relieve pain and when I @@@.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
Then I get a snap @@@ and it used to @@@.

DOCTOR B610
@@@.

PATIENT B610
And it pops.  

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
Sometimes it pops loud.  I think probably you could hear it, I think it is popping now.

DOCTOR B610
And you've had MRIs of your shoulder before?

PATIENT B610
Yeah.

DOCTOR B610
Of your @@@.

PATIENT B610
The MRI and the whatcha call that other thing?  When you go inside the tube?

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
Yeah I had that.

DOCTOR B610
CAT scan, MRI.  Are you still following with the rheumatologist?  The guy that gave you the injections?

PATIENT B610
I think next time is the 26th.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT B610
Okay thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  24:09  DOCTOR IN:  31:15)

DOCTOR B610
Alright.

PATIENT B610
You didn't have to hurry back.

DOCTOR B610
Huh?

PATIENT B610
You didn't hurry.

DOCTOR B610
Uh alright so we're gonna have you come back in two weeks.

PATIENT B610
Okay.

DOCTOR B610
Uh.  When you come back, take your lisinopril, take it the same way, the half pill every day.  Take it the morning of too, so the morning you're coming back for this.

PATIENT B610
Well I have to take it at night or do you want me to take it in the morning?

DOCTOR B610
Oh cause you're taking it.

PATIENT B610
You want me to take it in the morning again?

DOCTOR B610
Well you can take it at night, that's fine.  If that's the way you've been doing it, just take it at night. Just remember to take it the night before then.

PATIENT B610
Okay.

DOCTOR B610
Alright and um we're gonna give you a monitor today okay.

PATIENT B610
Alright.

DOCTOR B610
You said you know how to use it?

PATIENT B610
Yep.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.

PATIENT B610
I used to take care of my aunt.

DOCTOR B610
Oh okay.

PATIENT B610
I used to check it every day several times a day.  She had it real bad so I used to give her two sliding pills at one time and insulin.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
I used to give her.

DOCTOR B610
Shots and stuff?

PATIENT B610
Yeah a shot that sit underneath the skin.

DOCTOR B610
Uh-huh.

PATIENT B610
She didn't like that too much.  She been dead two years now.  I took care of her about eight years.

DOCTOR B610
I’m sorry to  hear that. Um I've ordered the strips uh, the whole deal okay.  So you can pick that up today.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
Uh and what we want to do, again, the plan is to.

PATIENT B610
Can you get the batteries for my blood pressure machine?

DOCTOR B610
I think what you have to do; do you know where you get the blood pressure machine on the second floor of Prosthetics?

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
I would go back to them and say I need batteries for this.  I think you're the ones where I get it.

PATIENT B610
I can buy the batteries though too.

DOCTOR B610
I don't think uh, I can't order batteries.

PATIENT B610
Okay well then I can get them.

DOCTOR B610
But they may have it.

PATIENT B610
I can go get some from Walgreens.

DOCTOR B610
Alright so I'm ordering you that thing.  Now what you do just like two or three times a week, out of the week you know, just two or three days out of the whole week check your sugar, record it on a piece of paper okay.  Ideally you want to be fasting so you're gonna take it, when you wake up in the morning check it.  Or if you eat check it two hours after you eat or something.

PATIENT B610
Right.

DOCTOR B610
But if you eat like a piece of candy and then check your sugar it's gonna be high.  You got to make sure that we want to get accurate fasting sugars.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
So when you wake up in the morning, ideally you could just check your sugars, two or three times.

PATIENT B610
Before I eat, before I take my medicine.

DOCTOR B610
You could do that yeah.

PATIENT B610
Because I take the medicine at night.

DOCTOR B610
Right okay, that's perfect.

PATIENT B610
Okay.

DOCTOR B610
And then so check it two or three times a week, log it and then bring that paper in.

PATIENT B610
Right.

DOCTOR B610
If your sugars are great we're just gonna take you off the metformin.

PATIENT B610
Okay.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.  Sounds like a good idea?

PATIENT B610
Sounds like a plan.

DOCTOR B610
Alright, we'll see you back in two weeks to see what you're uh see what your blood pressure is okay.  Oh and there's one other thing I want to check some blood work.  Your blood count has been going down a little bit.  Slowly, it hasn't been a big drop okay. 

PATIENT B610
What do you mean going down?

DOCTOR B610
Your hemoglobin, which is your blood in your body.

PATIENT B610
Hmm.

DOCTOR B610
Blood count, it's trended down a little bit okay.  And that could be because you don't have enough iron in your body maybe.  It could be for a lot of different reasons okay.  So I just wanted to check it and make sure it's stable.  Since you're on the aspirin or Plavix that can cause bleeding a little bit sometimes too.  Have you noticed any black or bloody stools or anything like that?

PATIENT B610
No.

DOCTOR B610
So we're just gonna check your blood count and uh I just wanted to check your blood count and make sure it's okay.  You won't have to get it today.  You can get it when you come back to see your rheumatologist on the 26th.  You could do it then or you could do it today if you want.

PATIENT B610
I was gonna ask you, I got a @@@ something here, I just thought about it when you said something about my blood count.  @@@ I got a bruise and I don’t even know where it come from.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah it's probably the aspirin can cause a little bleeding sometimes cause your blood might be a little what we call thin.

PATIENT B610
Yeah on it @@@ so.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
And that's the only thing, about two or three days ago, maybe four days ago now, I say man what happened here, I didn't remember, seemed like something, somebody, this thing here you know I might have hit my hand here.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.  Is that @@@?

DOCTOR B610
No looks pretty good, not bad, looks like it's just there and that can happen with being on the aspirin and the Plavix.

PATIENT B610
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B610
That can happen; you can have some minor bleeding.

PATIENT B610
Oh.

DOCTOR B610
But as long as it's not huge uh you should be okay.

PATIENT B610
@@@ doesn’t hurt.

DOCTOR B610
It should be okay but I want to just check your blood count to make sure everything is alright.

PATIENT B610
Okay.

DOCTOR B610
We can keep an eye on it and its fine.

PATIENT B610
This morning I took my medicines.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
That @@@.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah and you don't have to be fasting for this.

PATIENT B610
Oh okay.

DOCTOR B610
Okay.  @@@ check your iron levels.

PATIENT B610
We'll get the blood in the bank.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah and then you get your monitor today, make sure you give that to the clerk okay.

PATIENT B610
Right.  Uh I was thinking about giving some blood for the uh, Katrina, oh not Katrina.

DOCTOR B610
Haiti?

PATIENT B610
Haiti.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
It won't bother like me being on the Plavix and stuff?

DOCTOR B610
Uh no, no, you should be okay.  I want to check your um, now I want to make sure your blood counts are okay before you start giving blood um because if the blood counts are low I don't want you giving blood because your blood counts are low.  So you know, it's not horribly low.  Um you used to be like in the 13 to 14 range your hemoglobin, your blood count.

PATIENT B610
Hmm.

DOCTOR B610
And you're like at, the last time we checked it in November, it was 12.7, so it's slightly less, so slightly kind of getting lower.

PATIENT B610
And I had it just in December, they took two tubes there.

DOCTOR B610
But they may have not ordered this specific test.

PATIENT B610
Oh oh.

DOCTOR B610
So we'll check this today and make sure.  If its, I'll give you a call if its stable you can, I see no problems giving blood.  Even if you're on aspirin or Plavix you can give blood, that's not a problem.

PATIENT B610
Okay.  Yeah I was wondering about that because I used to be a donor.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
@@@ I am a @@@ donor.

DOCTOR B610
Is your number still NUMBER? I’ll give you a call.

PATIENT B610
Yeah.  Alright thank you.

DOCTOR B610
Alright yep.

PATIENT B610
And when you find that out, come find me, @@@.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah.

PATIENT B610
Sometime next weej.

DOCTOR B610
Right.

PATIENT B610
So I know if I can give blood.  That's what I did when I don't have the money; I give some of this weak blood.  I got the kind of blood that they say can save.  One pint of my blood can save twelve people.

DOCTOR B610
Yeah I mean it must be one of those universal blood donor blood types.

PATIENT B610
It's an 0, negative or positive.  Probably 0 negative I would say.

DOCTOR B610
Alright well you take care.  We'll probably see you in a couple of months then.

PATIENT B610
Does it show the type?  I think it was 0 negative when I was asked but I'm not sure, that's why I ask.  When I was 18 years old, the first time I ever donated blood was to one of my aunts.

DOCTOR B610
Oh really.

PATIENT B610
When I found out that I had @@@.  She had a rare type blood @@@.  AB blood.  But good luck doc.

DOCTOR B610
When you come back in, just give that paper to the clerk and you can pick up your monitor.  Alright take care.
