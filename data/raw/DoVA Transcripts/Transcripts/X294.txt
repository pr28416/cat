Sharp pain.

PATIENT X294
Every now and then.

DOCTOR X294
Okay and when do you get that?  When you're walking or is it at rest?

PATIENT X294
Yes.

DOCTOR X294
And is that the pain you were telling the cardiologist or no?

PATIENT X294
Yeah and sometimes when I walk in heavy snow, something like that, it goes beat, beat, beat. And then I have to stop.

DOCTOR X294
Okay, @@@.  Okay then how far can you walk?  You said half a block before you get that chest pain.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
Is that the same or different?

PATIENT X294
Yeah about the same.

DOCTOR X294
About the same okay.

PATIENT X294
You think you could give me something for gas?

DOCTOR X294
Yeah I can give you something for gas but we need to make sure it's not your heart.

PATIENT X294
Yeah well I need something for gas.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah.  Do you think it's because the belching makes that chest pain better.

Sometimes.

PATIENT X294
About the same.

DOCTOR X294

PATIENT X294
Could you tell me when are they gonna operate on me?

DOCTOR X294
Um let's see.  Did you see the doctor, the foot doctor I mean the orthopedist?  Oh you mean the cardiologist?

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
They wanted you to come back in - last week or two weeks ago.

PATIENT X294
Yeah there was a storm that day.

DOCTOR X294
Oh that day yeah.

PATIENT X294
I didn't make it in because of that storm.

DOCTOR X294
So you were supposed to come back last Thursday it was January 4th, was...  Yeah you were supposed to come the 7th and you couldn't come.

PATIENT X294
I don’t remember all that.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah that's when they wanted you to come.

PATIENT X294
But uh could you tell me when they were going to operate on that, you know I want.

DOCTOR X294
Oh I need you to probably come back and see them.

PATIENT X294
Can I talk to them today about the operation?

DOCTOR X294
Today?

PATIENT X294
Yes I want to get this over with.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah no I think it's an important thing cause we don't know what's going on with your chest pain because you have the heart disease.

PATIENT X294
I have a heart disease?

DOCTOR X294
Yeah your heart.  You know that you had a heart attack right?

PATIENT X294
Yeah in July.

DOCTOR X294
So that shows that you have like um some clogged arteries in your heart.

PATIENT X294
Yeah they said they could put some stents in there.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah they want to take a look at it you know.  Didn't you have stents put in?

PATIENT X294
Yes ma'am in uh.

DOCTOR X294
@@@.

PATIENT X294
Pardon me (patient takes a phone call).

DOCTOR X294
I think if we get you admitted today you'll be okay, if we admit you?  Because you shouldn't go around with these chest pains going on.  Can we admit you today?

PATIENT X294
Okay you can admit me today.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah let me talk about it.  Let's have you sit up here okay.  Um cause they wanted to admit you back the last time they saw you right?  But you had to handle some financial matters @@@.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
So I think since you've been having this chest pain, if it's been happening every day, it's pretty much every time you walk half a block right?

PATIENT X294
Yeah.

DOCTOR X294
And so does it occur all the time when you walk or just.

PATIENT X294
Every now and then now.

DOCTOR X294
Okay.

PATIENT X294
It's not, @@@ not as sharp.

DOCTOR X294
Not as sharp but it's been going.  You can sit right here.

PATIENT X294
Okay.

DOCTOR X294
I think it might be a good idea if we just go ahead and admit you, but I'll just go talk to someone to see if we can do that okay. Say ah.  I might have to do an EKG just to see what's going on okay.

PATIENT X294
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X294
I think that'd be the best thing because they were worried about you last time and we need to put you on the right medications too, okay.

PATIENT X294
Okay.

DOCTOR X294
Alright deep breath, okay another one.  Another one, good, breath in, good.  Okay can you lay back for me.  So you sleep on about one and a half pillows and that's been like that for a while?

PATIENT X294
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR X294
@@@.  Do you smoke or drink or anything?

PATIENT X294
No I don't drink and I don't use dope but I smoke.

DOCTOR X294
You smoke.

PATIENT X294
Yes ma’am, but I.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah you should try stopping because that's not good especially since you have, since you had a heart attack.  I want to just look at your legs for the swelling, sorry.

PATIENT X294
Yeah.  Let me take this shoe off.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah.

PATIENT X294
I'll take this shoe off.

DOCTOR X294
It's pretty swollen in your feet.

PATIENT X294
Yeah this foot here.

DOCTOR X294
Is really swollen.

PATIENT X294
Well I got hit with a steel @@@.

DOCTOR X294

PATIENT X294
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR X294
Yeah.

PATIENT X294
Okay.  Oh.  

DOCTOR X294
You have a little swelling yeah.  It's just a little bit.

PATIENT X294

DOCTOR X294
Uh-huh.  So you have swelling okay.  Alright.  I'll have you sit back.  You can put your stuff back on and I'll be right back okay.

DOCTOR X294

PATIENT X294
Okay.

DOCTOR X294

(DOCTOR OUT:  19:12  DOCTOR IN:  23:23)

DOCTOR X294
Alright sir.  Can I actually have you wait outside but it'll be a second.  Um we're trying to contact the cardiologist too okay.  So you are willing to get admitted though and I think it's a good idea to do that okay.

PATIENT X294

DOCTOR X294
Okay don't forget your sock.

PATIENT X294

DOCTOR X294
Dropped your sock yeah.
