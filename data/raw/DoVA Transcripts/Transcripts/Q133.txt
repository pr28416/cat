PATIENT Q133
Uh the insulin I have a good supply of.

DOCTOR Q133
How much insulin are you actually taking now?  Uh Glargine the long-acting 70 units at night.

PATIENT Q133
I cut back on that.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay.

PATIENT Q133
We're down to 55 on that now.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay and then.

PATIENT Q133
Cause my sugar was dropping in the middle of the night so we cut back to 55.  On the Aspart.

DOCTOR Q133
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q133
The human insulin cut back to 14 units.

DOCTOR Q133
With each meal.

PATIENT Q133
Uh morning, one in the morning and one at night.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay.  How have your blood sugar levels been looking?

PATIENT Q133
They been looking, I'm pretty good but like I said.

DOCTOR Q133
When you wake up in the morning what is it?

PATIENT Q133
Oh.

DOCTOR Q133
Oh you have a log.  Awesome. Let's see, yeah let’s take a peek at it.

PATIENT Q133
Okay @@@, uh this is this week.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay. Let's see, I see, so this is the time and that's the level?

PATIENT Q133
Right.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay.  In the 150s and 170s and 115 okay.  And you check it, is this before you take your, is this before you take your evening?

PATIENT Q133
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay.

PATIENT Q133
Yeah just before I eat and take the insulin.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay.  Any times where you've gone you know like below 70?

PATIENT Q133
Oh yes.

DOCTOR Q133
Yes, no, I see a 67 one night there.  What's that?

PATIENT Q133
No 41.

DOCTOR Q133
Before or after you started cutting back a little bit okay.  Alright.  I see some ones in here that but you started cutting back I see okay, yeah alright.  Did anyone tell you to cut back?

PATIENT Q133
Oh they told me before when they first put me on it that if it should start dropping.

DOCTOR Q133
Good.  I actually think that's appropriate.  Cause I don't want you, you know when you're 60, 70, that's a little too low.

PATIENT Q133
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q133
That's worrisome.  Were you shaking and feeling dizzy or?

PATIENT Q133
Uh well it starts in the leg area.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay.

PATIENT Q133
And they start tingling and then it goes up into the lips and then once it gets in there, then my eyes just seem to blur up the left eye and when that happens.

DOCTOR Q133
Yeah.

PATIENT Q133
I know what's happening, something's going wrong.

DOCTOR Q133
Over the past week how have things been?

PATIENT Q133
Uh, this past uh.

DOCTOR Q133
Any day.  It doesn't look like you've been low.

PATIENT Q133
Sunday I didn't mark it down but Sunday morning it dropped down to 42 at about 3 o'clock in the morning I woke up, used the washroom and I was feeling kind of funny so I decided to take it.  You know when I took it, it was 42.

DOCTOR Q133
Alright.

PATIENT Q133
It was 42 and uh I took some orange juice, drank some orange juice which was Sunny D and brought it back up.

DOCTOR Q133
Is that the only time it's happened like that or is it?

PATIENT Q133
Uh this week yeah.

DOCTOR Q133
Is it, if you find yourself with blood sugar levels that low, that's pretty concerning.

PATIENT Q133
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q133
Um we might need to even go down a little bit more.  Most of your other levels though seems like they're, like 150s, 170s and 110s, it might be just a one isolated event.

PATIENT Q133
Yeah well these uh perhaps when I had a light dinner.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay.

PATIENT Q133
And uh just what I did, I had just maybe just eaten a sandwich @@@.

DOCTOR Q133
Alright well in those situations you might need to you know cut back a little.

PATIENT Q133
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q133
Cause what you're doing is essentially covering yourself with insulin.

PATIENT Q133
Right.

DOCTOR Q133
Absorb the sugar but if you suddenly don't have enough sugar, uh as much sugar as you normally have then you're giving yourself too much insulin.

PATIENT Q133
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q133
But if you think you're gonna you know not eat very much, cut back a little bit.

PATIENT Q133
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q133
Uh but otherwise I mean on the whole these look pretty good uh.  Yeah and you know do you know what your goals are for the morning?

PATIENT Q133
Uh off hand I don’t because they’ve been fluctuating so much.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay.

PATIENT Q133
It's fluctuating so much.

DOCTOR Q133
I mean ideally you know below 130, 120 in the morning.

PATIENT Q133
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Q133
But and so you can, every few days you can go up about 2 units to try to get your, with the long-acting.

PATIENT Q133
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q133
To get yourself below there, with the caveat that if you're getting those low levels, those 60s, you know below 70s, even in the 60s or lower, something like that, then you've got to be more liberal and you have to give yourself a much bigger range, let yourself go higher.  Cause the going too low, that's more worrisome than having higher, slightly higher okay.

PATIENT Q133
Yeah.  So I think uh I think that I'm actually gonna need a new, actually get myself a new meter, this one is not very accurate.  I don't know I tried calibrating it and everything but it still goes up and down so I don't get very good readings.

DOCTOR Q133
Oh well let's try to get you a new.  It's the glucometer reading.

PATIENT Q133
Right yeah.

DOCTOR Q133
Yeah I can certainly do that for you cause, we definitely need to have good readings.

PATIENT Q133
Uh-huh.  What should be an ideal blood pressure?

DOCTOR Q133
For you, under, below 130/80.

PATIENT Q133
So 130 over 80.

DOCTOR Q133
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q133
Okay.  I’ve been under the impression it should be below 139 and 80.

DOCTOR Q133
Well not quite.

PATIENT Q133
@@@.

DOCTOR Q133
Yeah.

PATIENT Q133
I had @@@.

DOCTOR Q133
Okay.

PATIENT Q133
Tell me my reading should be.

DOCTOR Q133
Well 130/80, that's what you want.

PATIENT Q133
130 over 80.  @@@.  And the heartrate should be?

DOCTOR Q133
Uh between 60 and 90.  Between 60 and 100.  You doing your long-acting in the morning or at night?

PATIENT Q133
Uh in the morning.

DOCTOR Q133
Good okay.

PATIENT Q133
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q133
Have you always done it in the morning?

PATIENT Q133
Right.

DOCTOR Q133
Alright yeah.

PATIENT Q133
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q133
That's probably best for you so that you don't bottom out at night.

PATIENT Q133
Right.

DOCTOR Q133
Alright, I definitely agree with that.

PATIENT Q133
Yeah DOCTOR started me on that one a long time ago.

DOCTOR Q133
That's sounds just right.

PATIENT Q133
That's taking more away from, if it's gonna spike, it's gonna spike during the daytime when I'm awake.

DOCTOR Q133
Exactly yeah.

PATIENT Q133
