DOCTOR H973
And then they put you in.

PATIENT H973
And I just stayed.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  Yeah so just looking at your labs when you were talking, what they presumed it was due to low potassium.  Um.

PATIENT H973
@@@ something coming on, I just thought it could be anything.  I was @@@ to read and watching TV

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And all of a sudden I felt like I was going to pass out.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
And I felt it coming on.

DOCTOR H973
Here.

PATIENT H973
And my breathing would be kind of @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And so I wouldn't fight it, I'd just, would fight for air.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
I just gradually, gradually really be out of control.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
But then @@@ it wouldn't go away, it kept getting worse.  

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
You know I'm getting weak.  My legs are getting weak.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
And not only was I out of breath but @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
I knew it was @@@ heart attack.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
Or something.  That's why I came over.

DOCTOR H973
Okay well the good thing was it wasn't.

PATIENT H973
No it wasn't but.

DOCTOR H973
It definitely wasn't a heart attack. But it's really important.  Now you're an asthmatic is that correct?

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  You're not smoking cigarettes any more are you?

PATIENT H973
No I quit a long time ago.

DOCTOR H973
Okay and how's your breathing?

PATIENT H973
My breathing is alright.  You know it's been kind of, I think I'm coming down with a cold.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

SECOND PERSON H973
He sounds kind of wheezy.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah he does, when he came in here.

PATIENT H973
And that's, and that's what I know I've got asthma.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
Cause I don't got anything at home now but before whenever I got an asthma attack I'd go to the hospital, now I got a, what do you call it?

DOCTOR H973
A nebulizer.

PATIENT H973
A nebulizer.

DOCTOR H973
How often are you having to use that?

PATIENT H973
Well, when I get to the point where the medications aren't helping I go to the nebulizer and that helps it right away.

DOCTOR H973
How many times a week do you think you've been using that regularly?

SECOND PERSON H973
Um the last time he used it was in November.

DOCTOR H973
Oh excellent, oh good.  Okay good. 

SECOND PERSON H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
That tells me that the daily medications, cause the way that we treat this is try to get the daily medications to make you so you don't need the rescue medication.

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
So um sounds like you're in a good place.  This season is trouble.

PATIENT H973
It is.

DOCTOR H973
Cause a lot of patients with um asthma or COPD.

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
Your airway is hyperreactive so if there's, if someone would get a little sniffle, from an allergy or a cold or whatever, it's gonna hang out and be a lot longer than it would with the next guy.

PATIENT H973
Okay, uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
Um so I can deal with you being a little wheezy as long as you feel like you can walk around and you're not using the rescue inhaler too much.

PATIENT H973
Well I been waiting for the one @@@ hibernating for the year. 

DOCTOR H973
Really.

PATIENT H973
I couldn't get out during the wintertime.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
Usually I go away, I don’t stay in Chicago.

SECOND PERSON H973
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah sure.

PATIENT H973
Over winter a few months.

DOCTOR H973
Where do go?

PATIENT H973
Texas or California.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah, somewhere warm.

PATIENT H973
Wherever I can find relatives @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah okay.  Any weakness in the legs?  Have you been sustaining any falls?

PATIENT H973
Not lately but I've been very careful.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
The trouble is that if I'm walking my back, is real bad.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
Cause when I get that pain on my back it's just, I have to fall and that's the only way that I could fall.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
I have to be careful cause when I get the feeling I want to pull up and grab something.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
Because it's, I'm just pretty sure it's something I have.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
If there's nothing to hold on to.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah we got to be careful.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
You got to be careful.  I don’t want you to clunk your head. 

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
You're not on Warfarin and you have a filter?

PATIENT H973
Now I got a filter.

DOCTOR H973
Good.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Past medical history otherwise, we talked about the asthma, COPD and I read about you, so correct me if I’m wrong, the @@@ which is a pretty rare disease.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
I've never seen that.

PATIENT H973
@@@ is worse.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.  It's just a vasculitis thing but it's just not that common.

PATIENT H973
What is it?

DOCTOR H973
It's in the vasculitis family, it has to do with the blood clots but it's pretty rare, pretty rare.  Um other things that you have, you've had colon cancer in the past.

PATIENT H973
Right.

DOCTOR H973
Is that correct? Okay.  Um they diagnosed you with an iron deficiency anemia when you were last in the hospital.

PATIENT H973
You know, I've had, the regular doctor, my private doctor that I’ve had for years.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
When I @@@ VA for my private physician.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
I didn't drop him cause I've had him for over @@@ years.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
@@@ he knows me more.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT H973
But he always told me, are you losing any blood anywhere.

DOCTOR H973
Right.

PATIENT H973
I said why.  He said your blood work always shows you.

DOCTOR H973
A little anemic.

PATIENT H973
Yeah a little anemic and he knows about it.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
And uh the reason I got to @@@ little concern.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah I mean we worry, so when were you diagnosed with the colon cancer?

PATIENT H973
'89.

DOCTOR H973
Okay so you sometimes that's an early symptom of colon cancer and I don't know how yours presented but sometimes people will come in with this kind of slow bleed.

PATIENT H973
@@@ actually I happened to be, I retired that year.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
From the job and I went in to see him, having an appointment and I said doctor I noticed some blood in my stool today.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
This morning and he said well I want you to send you to the Lab for some tests.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
He sent me to, you know I had lab there at the clinic and he sent me there and they didn't find anything @@@ He said I don’t trust @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
They sent me for the lab down there.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
Good thing he did.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
Cause they found the cancer.

DOCTOR H973
Um did you have a surgery to remove @@@?

PATIENT H973
Yes.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
Yeah I have an incision from here to here.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  Did you have to have a bag at some point?

PATIENT H973
No.

DOCTOR H973
Did they connect.

PATIENT H973
No the doctor said that you’re lucky that we found it in time.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  I don't @@@ how long it is and that would have to be in the records to look um.  Are you having any blood in the stool or black tarry stools now?

PATIENT H973
You know what happened, I don't know maybe about three years ago I got up during the night, maybe 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning and I went to the toilet and I had something like diarrhea and I looked down and it was all blood.

DOCTOR H973
And that was three years ago.

PATIENT H973
About three years ago.

DOCTOR H973
Okay then what happened?

PATIENT H973
I went upstairs and I called @@@, you got to get up; I got to go to the hospital.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
She took me to St. Joseph.

DOCTOR H973
Did they do a colonoscopy?

PATIENT H973
They did a lot of stuff.

DOCTOR H973
What was the diagnosis?

PATIENT H973
They, that's when they found the uh.

SECOND PERSON H973
@@@ [Shear Shaw?].

DOCTOR H973
Oh that was when they found @@@.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
Okay wow, okay well yeah so I mean there's a couple explanations.  The fact that you had a colonoscopy as recent as three years ago I'm pretty confident that it's not a recurring colon cancer coming back.

PATIENT H973
Well they.

DOCTOR H973
Colon cancer takes ten years to develop.  That's why we say when you turn 50 get one.

PATIENT H973
Right.

DOCTOR H973
That's how long it takes the polyps to become a cancer.

PATIENT H973
But they.

DOCTOR H973
The only thing, I'm sorry.

PATIENT H973
Sure.

DOCTOR H973
The other thing is that the @@@ if they found little blood vessels, sometimes you just get here and there you know if you're on prednisone, they’re not going to fix, you could be bleeding still from that.  The other thing is I don't know exactly what they took out.  Iron is absorbed in the far part of the small bowel, near to the colon right where the appendix is.

PATIENT H973
Right.

DOCTOR H973
So sometimes you see colectomies and they end up taking a part of the small bowel @@@.  So that's kind of three good reasons why you might be a little anemic.  But as long as you're not getting dizzy, you're not having chest pain, your blood count's really not that low, kind of low grade anemia.

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
I'm not super worried about it.  Um the other thing I wanted to do is, they diagnosed you with an iron deficiency but they didn't look to see how much iron the body stored up.

PATIENT H973
Alright.

DOCTOR H973
I'd like to see that cause sometimes when people have things like @@@, any kind of disease, your body stockpiles iron.

PATIENT H973
And you know what.

DOCTOR H973
Cause it doesn't want the blood @@@.

PATIENT H973
@@@ keeps repeating.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
@@@ then every year now it happens.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
Where I all of a sudden have breathing and @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
And they look at one thing and by the time they started looking in there, there's no place, they can't find the location.

DOCTOR H973
Right.

PATIENT H973
It could be @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
Inside my intestine.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah cause those @@@ and they're real annoying to try to find cause they'll bleed for a little bit then they'll stop.

PATIENT H973
Hmm.

DOCTOR H973
And they're not able to @@@.

PATIENT H973
Well I guess we're just gonna have to keep an eye on it.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
Cause I know it's gonna happen again.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
Cause I've had that every year for the last three years.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
@@@.

PATIENT H973
Probably gonna happen again unless you give me something to stop it.

DOCTOR H973
Well we'll give you iron to get your blood storage up.

PATIENT H973
Yeah @@@ iron.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  Anything else bothering you aside from the anemia?

PATIENT H973
I'm very weak.  Cause I've been home.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
I lost my appetite.  I lost, once I was 175 pounds, I'm down to 167 pounds.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
I mean I love to eat.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
And she'll take me, I like to eat at restaurants.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
So we eat out a lot.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
And I get my favorite food.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
And @@@.

DOCTOR H973
What's your favorite foods?

PATIENT H973
Anything with grease and fat in it.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

SECOND PERSON H973
Anything that's fried.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.  Does he live with you?

SECOND PERSON H973
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Okay, okay, alright.  Um well that's kind of a vague complaint.  Sometimes when you're your age um being in the hospital can also take you out um.

PATIENT H973
Usually when I go to the hospital when I didn't know if I was going to @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And it's bothering me.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
To the point where I've been losing sleep and I keep thinking, it's not worth it, is this it?

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.  Your diabetes panel was really low.  Um that can't really explain about the stabbing sort of pain you get.  You might have back spasms, a lot of people do have.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
Arthritis and stuff but I'm really happy that you're not, that you know come @@@, I don't want you falling down or anything. That makes me really nervous.

PATIENT H973
You know I had stones in my bladder?

SECOND PERSON H973
Gallbladder.

DOCTOR H973
Oh that's okay.

PATIENT H973
And they, that would be they scheduled me for surgery at St. Josephs’s and I talked to the surgery and @@@ diet and medications.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And he never called me.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
So instead my doctor gave me enough medications to resolve the stones.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah, yeah.  Generally with gallstones if they don't bother you they don't bother us as a general rule and like you're right a surgeon never wants somebody to go into surgery if they're not gonna definitely feel better afterwards.

PATIENT H973
And the fact that he couldn't go in, @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Oh it was laparoscopic?

PATIENT H973
Yeah, he couldn't do that.

DOCTOR H973
Oh.

PATIENT H973
But he said he had to go in because of the cancer surgery.

DOCTOR H973
Oh okay.

PATIENT H973
And they had to go in and open it.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
But my doctor didn't want to do it.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And uh and.

SECOND PERSON H973
@@@.

PATIENT H973
I have to tell you one other thing because that's a couple of years.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And uh I know I've been that way for years and I just couldn't take it.

DOCTOR H973
Is this gallbladder pain?

PATIENT H973
Once in a while I get a little pain.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And you know they said well if it goes to the back then you've got to worry about it.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah, you're supposed to go to the shoulder.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
So I wouldn't worry about that.  If you start getting fevers and chills and sweats that’s when we worry.

PATIENT H973
Oh that, okay.

DOCTOR H973
Because something could get infected but again if they don't bother you they don't bother me.

PATIENT H973
Well can you give me that prescription? I need the prescriptions.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
Yeah I usually call it in for the first thing but the number on there @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah this is for the @@@.

PATIENT H973
@@@.  That's all I got.

DOCTOR H973
Oh for your blood sugars?

PATIENT H973
I need refills you know.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
I need to get them.

DOCTOR H973
Do you get them here?

PATIENT H973
They um get them from the outside so.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
The only other time that I came in here uh that was to the hospital and they gave them to me.

DOCTOR H973
Okay they gave you these kinds and they worked?

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
Okay cause they contract with of course one glucometer maker, one you know what I mean.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
There are about a billion glucometer makers.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
I want to make sure.

PATIENT H973
I don't know if the VA gave me that or the @@@.  But I think I might as well today from here.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah absolutely.

SECOND PERSON H973
Cause we don’t know, the machine itself.

PATIENT H973
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Let me just make sure it's compatible you know.  I should be able to look it up.  Do you like it to go to your house or do you want to pick it up at the window?

PATIENT H973
No I better pick it up cause that's all I have.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
Both medications I have to pick up.

DOCTOR H973
Okay you've been on this for a while right?

PATIENT H973
Both of them.

DOCTOR H973
Okay just to make your co-pay simpler I'll give you a 90 day supply.

PATIENT H973
Right.

DOCTOR H973
With three refills and then I'll see you in six months but I'll give you my card and everything if you need to see me before then.

PATIENT H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
Um.

SECOND PERSON H973
So you'll still be here in six months?

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
I know, we change you know cause this is like our apprenticeship.  I've been in medical school and I have an MD and all that stuff but um I'm getting tweaked you know.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
So I always practice under somebody which is good.

PATIENT H973
Actually yeah they're recording me, the conversation.

DOCTOR H973
Oh really?  Did they tell you?

PATIENT H973
Yeah it's in my jacket I don't even know if you can @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Oh that's good to know.

PATIENT H973
If it picks it up.

DOCTOR H973
They've been doing it.  I mean that's really funny.

PATIENT H973
That's why I told you that you're going be on Candid Camera.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah, yeah I wondered.  So you only have precision um not free style, you know what I mean so I don't know if they're gonna be compatible.

PATIENT H973
It's the same thing all over yeah.  Cause I.  You know what I could do is that I had that machine for years, I wonder if I could get a new one.

DOCTOR H973
Uh does it work okay?

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
It's beginning to get a lot of errors on it.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
It's like I was talking to someone the other day on the phone, they wanted to give me a new machine.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
And she said you know those machines don't last forever.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And it works for years.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And you should think about replacing it.

DOCTOR H973
So what I'll do is, if you're concerned about it anyway it might be a good time just to give you the Precision brand strips to just give you a Precision machine.

PATIENT H973
Right, right.

DOCTOR H973
So we can give you that.  Other medications I have you on, let's see here.

PATIENT H973
We got a list.

DOCTOR H973
Oh good.

PATIENT H973

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  Has anybody changed anything since you came out of the hospital here?

SECOND PERSON H973
No.

PATIENT H973

SECOND PERSON H973
No this is the first time he's come back.

DOCTOR H973

PATIENT H973

DOCTOR H973
For six months.

PATIENT H973
Right.

DOCTOR H973
Um when you came out of the hospital they said that your magnesium and it was really low.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
When it came so that can cause sometimes a cramping in the legs and a sensation of weakness.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
The magnesium I don't want to keep you too long on it.

PATIENT H973
Could you give me for my cramps I used to @@@ and they used to give me, what was it, uh some kind of medication for cramps.

DOCTOR H973
Oh I don't know that could be anything.

PATIENT H973
It was called, I can't remember, but I used to keep a supply of it all the time and I haven’t had any like you said the reason why I get cramps in the legs.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
And I'd get up and walk around.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And I couldn’t get any more medications @@@.

SECOND PERSON H973
Well he's, he has one bottle of the @@@ or whatever that is.

DOCTOR H973
The Docusate, that's a stool softener.

SECOND PERSON H973
The stool softener, he has one bottle but there's no more refills.

PATIENT H973
But I could call it in for a refill.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
But there's no refills.

DOCTOR H973
No I know, I can go through everything to make sure you have plenty of refills.

PATIENT H973
Oh yeah, yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
Iron uh there's no refill on it.

DOCTOR H973
No refills on iron, okay.

PATIENT H973
Can we get it?

SECOND PERSON H973
On that either and we don't have, there's no extra on that one.

DOCTOR H973
Did you want that today too?

PATIENT H973
We have enough.

SECOND PERSON H973
No we still have enough for um, let me see here, three four, okay.

DOCTOR H973
I'll make sure you have plenty so you know call us about two weeks before you run out.

PATIENT H973
Alright.

DOCTOR H973
But I'll look through all the medications and make sure you have enough refills.

SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
I know they have a number you have to call in and they'll send the medications but I don't have the number.

SECOND PERSON H973
But you need the refills.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
Cause those, your blood pressure ones you only have one more refill.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Now are you having any chest pain or shortness of breath?  I know, well you told me a little bit about that.

PATIENT H973
Yeah I had a little bit of it, like I say it came back again but it's not as severe like it was before.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  Is this the same kind of chest pain?

PATIENT H973
Yeah.  It's not a pain it's like, it's kind of like I'm running out of breath.

DOCTOR H973
Like a tightening you said is the word you used yeah.

PATIENT H973
Yeah I feel like it's, it's a good thing that it’s a gradual thing.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea?

PATIENT H973
No.

DOCTOR H973
You've had no blood in your stool?

PATIENT H973
My stomach has always been bad and I've got all kinds of medications for that.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  Are you moving your bowels okay @@@?

PATIENT H973
Yeah but I have to take something for it.

DOCTOR H973
Okay, that's okay.

PATIENT H973
That they gave me.

DOCTOR H973
As long as we got you to a good place.

PATIENT H973
Dark black stools are caused by the medications.

DOCTOR H973
The iron.

PATIENT H973
The iron.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah iron will tend to bind you up too so make sure you're taking the stool softener.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
Any trouble passing water?

PATIENT H973
No.

DOCTOR H973
Good okay.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Okay and you said before you feel like your legs are gonna go out you feel it, you can grab yourself.  You're not falling down or passing out?

PATIENT H973
No, no, no.  Not, @@@.  If I get up in the middle of the night I got a lot of light from the street and from the alley.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
My apartment is lit.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
But I do get up and walk to the bathroom.

DOCTOR H973
Good.

PATIENT H973
But I have to be very careful.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah definitely, definitely.

PATIENT H973
But usually I just take the walker.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.  Um @@@.  Good.  Let me just look.

PATIENT H973
I @@@.

DOCTOR H973
It's a little red.  I'm going to just, go ahead and close your mouth, close your mouth.  @@@.  It's a little red but it's not like, you know when little kids get strep throat and their tonsils get big and yucky, your’s is red.  

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
Coughing at night? Do you feel post nasal @@@.

PATIENT H973
No I thought it was @@@.  It probably something @@@ but mouth it could be just very dry.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
And that helps.

DOCTOR H973
Any pain going up this way?

PATIENT H973
No, no.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  I've seen a throat like that sometimes in patients that get sinus trouble.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
That's why I was asking you about a cough and stuff like that but of course with you having the asthma so who knows, you normally cough anyway right.

PATIENT H973
Right.

DOCTOR H973
So it's gonna be hard to say.  The other thing is sometimes patients will get sensations of reflux.

PATIENT H973
I have reflux anyway.

DOCTOR H973
And that would also.

PATIENT H973
Well I got to get a refill of the reflux medication.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  Are you having any trouble with reflux now?

PATIENT H973
No.

DOCTOR H973
Okay cause yeah usually a lot of patients.

SECOND PERSON H973
@@@ he has @@@.

DOCTOR H973
That's yeah.

PATIENT H973
I ran out of it, so I got to keep @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah so no even though it's fun to do that @@@ on a full stomach usually three hours, wait about three hours um, things like chocolate will really irritate some people.  Some people will say that they have trouble with like tomato sauces but they can eat a fresh tomato without trouble.  Um alcohol of course.  A glass of red wine is good for you and even a beer once in a while is good for you, but too much alcohol @@@.

PATIENT H973
What did you hear about my clot.

DOCTOR H973
What do you mean?

PATIENT H973
@@@ left leg.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
@@@ left side, all the way up there when I was in the hospital.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
And they were concerned about that because @@@ clot on the bottom of the leg.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
Wasn't bad but they said that would have to go up into your groin.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Well usually most of the clots, so if you have clots in the legs they're gonna go to the lungs so those can kill you.  These can hurt, but those can kill you.  Most the clots actually form in the thigh here.

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
And then they travel down and @@@.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
But you have a filter in.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah so we just have to wait for your body to break down that clot naturally.

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
Sometimes when you have things like @@@ and you have a lot of autoimmune diseases or you don't move around a lot, it's hard for your body to break those clots.

PATIENT H973
It's not @@@ cause you're not going out you know and fall and break a leg.

DOCTOR H973
Right.

PATIENT H973
So now I'm confined to the house.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
I you know I had to get up and walk.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
So haven't done anything like that, just inside the house.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
But I got a bicycle.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
You know.

SECOND PERSON H973
He hasn't really been alone since Thanksgiving.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

SECOND PERSON H973
Cause he caught a bad cold.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
And all winter he just couldn't get rid of it.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
And he'd get a little better and then he'd get you know sick again.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON H973
A little better and then get real sick again.

PATIENT H973
I just haven't been myself.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
For the last couple months or more.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah, doctor's order, that's a pretty good indication.  But yeah I think.  Cause that's a hard thing to really pinpoint you know.  Not feeling good like that.  I think um there are a couple of reasons pretty anemic, but you've been that anemic for a while so, you'd think your body would have adjusted.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
I can hear you, like your daughter said, wheezing quite a bit so you might be hanging on to a cold.

PATIENT H973
I just got over it.

DOCTOR H973
A little longer.

PATIENT H973
Right.  I had a cold with the asthma.

DOCTOR H973
And what I don't like is the losing weight you know.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
Um.

PATIENT H973
Well you know I think I've lost the weight because.

SECOND PERSON H973
How much did he weigh recently?

PATIENT H973
I'm starting.

SECOND PERSON H973
In the hospital.

PATIENT H973
When I was in the hospital I couldn't stand the food that they gave me for one thing.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
I wasn't hungry either.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
And I went home and the same thing, even though I eat the favorite foods.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
But what I'm saying but once @@@ I force myself to eat it.

DOCTOR H973
In the hospital you weighed 167, so you've really only lost like three or four pounds which I mean can be you know, it's not really much.  

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
But when you were telling me you used to be in the 170s, you've lost about 10 pounds.

PATIENT H973
Yeah @@@.

SECOND PERSON J257
I thinking @@@ a while ago.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah I know.

PATIENT H973
And like I said because of my clothes, they say I could get ride of my old clothes @@@.

DOCTOR H973
You were 175 in November so I mean that's actually less than.

SECOND PERSON H973
Oh it was less than ten?

DOCTOR H973
Yeah it's about, I would say in about six months you lost about ten pounds.

PATIENT H973
10 pounds.

DOCTOR H973
That's not so much where I really, really worry.

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
But we ought to keep an eye on it okay and make sure you're getting good nutrition.

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
Also once the weather starts get up and get out and get moving.

PATIENT H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
We'll draw your labs today to make sure your electrolytes aren't out of whack and just to make sure you're not too anemic.

SECOND PERSON H973
He had breakfast.

DOCTOR H973
Oh that's fine, yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
That doesn't matter?

DOCTOR H973
No that doesn't matter.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

SECOND PERSON H973
They can check the, what's that lab test the blood count?

DOCTOR H973
Yes.

SECOND PERSON H973
The iron, magnesium, potassium.

DOCTOR H973
So what I'm gonna check are the magnesium, potassium, do the panel where we check the kidney function level.

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
I'm gonna do that.  I'll check the blood count.  I'm not gonna check the iron level cause they checked that last time but I'm gonna check how the body stores of iron.

SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
Um because sometimes you know that can affect how much iron your body is able to use.

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
It's kind of hard to explain but um it actually when you have a lot of inflammation for one reason or the other the stored which [Sher Shaw?] @@@ is enough to account for that.  Um our body automatically thinks we have an infection you know which is kind of actually if you have an infection, the bacteria just loves iron, that's what they live on.

SECOND PERSON H973
Hmm.

DOCTOR H973
So your body just kind of collects iron.  So sometimes we can see patients with really low iron in the blood, not because they're not getting it, not because they're not absorbing it, not because they're losing it but rather your body's trying to sequestering as a sort of as a protective mechanism because through evolution you know it's what used kill people, hundreds of years ago used to get infection right.

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
Now we've gotten to the point where we've got antibiotics and all these things where you wash your hands but our body still thinks infection whenever there's a problem.

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
So we check the iron stores and the electrolytes.

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
And we'll just make sure there's nothing reported in the blood count, make sure there's nothing out of whack.  I'll make sure I have a phone number to contact you.

SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
Um so I'll let you know if there's any trouble.  Um we'll make sure you have enough refills, I'll see you in six months.  I'll give you my card you know so if you need to see me sooner and we'll give you, I already put in the ursodiol and your strips and the new monitor at the window.

SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
You should be able to pick those up whenever.

PATIENT H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
And I'll need to take a listen to your heart and your lungs.

PATIENT H973
Oh, do you want me to get up there?

DOCTOR H973
On no you're okay there, that's fine.  With your mouth open deep breaths in.  Yeah you're kind of wheezy.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
Good.  Deep breath in for me.  Can you just sit up on the table for me so I can poke on your stomach?

SECOND PERSON H973
He woke up today feeling achy and it's just like he's coming down with a cold.  So that's probably what it is.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah I mean, it's kind of the time for summer colds you know we're getting into that season where the summer viruses are coming.

SECOND PERSON H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
I'm sorry to interrupt I keep getting paged, I'm just gonna see who's paging me.  @@@.  Yeah @@@.  Is there anybody in the house with you to help him?

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh my brother comes down.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  (Doctor makes a phone call paging another doctor)  Your brother comes by?

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh yeah.  Yeah uh.

DOCTOR H973
Whoops sorry.

SECOND PERSON H973
@@@ if he does walk around you know he'll stumble, he stumbles.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
And you know he'll just.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
Catch himself.

PATIENT H973
I have to use the walker.

DOCTOR H973
You use a walker, do you have one at home?

PATIENT H973
Yeah.  When I'm walking and things like that, I had to start using the walker when one end of the house to the other.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
I use the walker.

DOCTOR H973
Can you feel your feet?  Like can you feel me touching you?

PATIENT H973
Yes.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  And do ever recall besides having that pain, you know you said you get like a sharp kind of stabbing pain sometimes in the back.  You ever fall apart from that?

PATIENT H973
The pain on the back?

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
That's the bad one.

DOCTOR H973
Right and does that what makes you stumble?

PATIENT H973
Yes it is.

DOCTOR H973
Does anything else make you stumble?

PATIENT H973
I think that's about the only pain cause it's around my back.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
It's the pain that he gets.

PATIENT H973
@@@.  As a matter of fact one time it was so bad that I couldn't even walk.  She had to bring me into the hospital.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
I mean, I just took a bone density test.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
Just this week.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
I don't know what the results were.

DOCTOR H973
Did you get it here?

PATIENT H973
I did it, yeah.

DOCTOR H973
So are you having any back pain now?

PATIENT H973
Always, always.  It's constant.  If it's severe I can’t stand it, it'll knock you down.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
If I step on it and put weight on it and the pain is there, I'm going to fall and then I grab something.

DOCTOR H973
So you have osteoporosis.

PATIENT H973
Oh.

DOCTOR H973
And all that means is your bones aren't very dense.  Your bones are normal they're just not very dense.  Um do you take calcium?

PATIENT H973
Hmm.

DOCTOR H973
With vitamin D?

PATIENT H973
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR H973
@@@.

PATIENT H973
I take it yeah, two times a day, it’s supposed to be three.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
But I take it two times a day.

DOCTOR H973
Okay so you know those commercials with Sally Fields?

SECOND PERSON H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
Um usually that's another osteoporosis medicine we put people on sometimes.  Um the reason we worry about osteoporosis is it doesn't in and of itself cause pain.  Most people don't even know they have it but if you do take a spill you're more prone to fractures, that's the problem.  So usually the number one fracture that people with osteoporosis get is they get compression fractures of the back so that may account for the back pain.  I don't know if you have it anywhere else.

SECOND PERSON H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah you probably have compression fractures.  I'm not sure um.

SECOND PERSON H973
It just says calcium carbonate, it doesn't say if it has vitamin D or not.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.

PATIENT H973
I think it's in the fine print.

DOCTOR H973
You have some scoliosis in there too um.

PATIENT H973
Yeah. 

DOCTOR H973
So you were probably born with that.  Let me go talk to DOCTOR, he's my boss.

PATIENT H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
And then we'll touch base.  I'll see if she has any suggestions about osteoporosis in terms of either adding.  The calcium carbonate, usually they make calcium and vitamin D together. I’m surprised he’s on just the calcium carbonate.

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H973
I’ve been taking this for years?

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Vitamin D pushes the calcium in the bone which is why we have them both together, but I'll be right back.

PATIENT H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
Get more comfortable.

PATIENT H973
Okay I'll better sit back and move.

DOCTOR H973
Just kind of be careful.

PATIENT H973
Alright.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  I'll be back in just a little bit okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  51:40  DOCTOR IN:  61:24)

DOCTOR H973
Alright, sorry to keep you guys waiting so long.

PATIENT H973
Alright.

DOCTOR H973
Um so let's do this um your ursodiol that you take for the bladder stones rather um and the test strips and the meter are waiting for you.

PATIENT H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
So stop and pick those up.  We'll do some labs like we talked about.  Um do you have a phone number I can reach you at?

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh yes uh NUMBER.

PATIENT H973
That's your cell.

SECOND PERSON H973
That's the cell.

DOCTOR H973
Okay I'll call you when the labs get back so probably, I'll call you by next week.

SECOND PERSON H973
Let me give you my father’s number.

DOCTOR H973
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON H973
NUMBER.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  I'll call you um if there's anything wrong of course I'll call you right away but I'll call you by next week irrespective if it’s right or wrong just to let you know um you know.

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
I'm gonna check a couple things, you know just general like we talked about and just make sure there's nothing else going on.  I don't like to leave things.  We'll start you on the one new medication too, the Sally Field medication the alendronate @@@.

PATIENT H973
@@@.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah cause we're at the point where I don't think calcium and vitamin D are enough.  I don't like to put people on medicine unless I think they need it but your osteoporosis is pretty bad.  What we do is they have a score measure you know how dense your bones are and yours are pretty brittle so you got to be careful okay.

PATIENT H973
So this medication is whatever you were talking about that combines with the calcium?

DOCTOR H973
No calcium and vitamin D is one thing.

PATIENT H973
Oh.

DOCTOR H973
Which you should be on anyway.

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
Um which I'm.

SECOND PERSON H973
Are you going to change this calcium to.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SECOND PERSON H973
Change the calcium.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.  He needs @@@ vitamin D.  I don't know why they would put him on just calcium carbonate um.

PATIENT H973
Is that @@@.

SECOND PERSON H973
Uh I think we just had it filled.

DOCTOR H973
Okay.  Well I mean what could you always do is I can give you a vitamin D supplement separate, you can go to Walgreen’s and get a cheap vitamin D supplement that’s fine with me, would you want me to do that and then just use up the calcium?

SECOND PERSON H973
Hmm.

DOCTOR H973
Okay I'll see if we have them here but I think it's important to just put @@@ alendronate which is once a day drug.

PATIENT H973
Hmm.

DOCTOR H973
Okay and then we're gonna repeat that test.

SECOND PERSON H973
And the side effects of it is?

DOCTOR H973
Um in cancer patients they found trouble with um, with the bones of the jaw.  Sometimes people have trouble swallowing um but apart from that it's a very safe drug.  So if you look it up I mean they are bizarre side effects those are the big ones to worry about but more of the side effects like I said were @@@ with the jaw in in cancer patients @@@ move to the bones.  Um very rare but esophageal, you're esophagus next to your mouth, your stomach.

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
You can have some esophageal narrowing from it so this is a very rare side effect.  Those are the two major ones we watch out for.  If you look it up on Google, you will get nausea and vomiting @@@ shortness of breath @@@ and all these other things.  Sometimes it can cause some stomach upset um so you can let me know if that happens but other than that.

PATIENT H973
I have my trouble with my stomach.

SECOND PERSON H973
Yeah that's one thing @@@ concerned @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Like the reflux.

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
That's different than what this causes um.  Reflux the best thing is lifestyle and not eating three hours before you go to bed.  Sometimes if people have a lot of trouble they will put their bed up on cinder blocks, not necessary a lot of pillows but put the actual top, you know what I mean, the two posts that are close to the wall.

PATIENT H973
I might.  They told me that for years.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.  Um those are the best things to do for it and if that doesn't work you know there's always medication which I believe.

PATIENT H973
Yeah I'm taking.

DOCTOR H973
You're on omeprazole which is the strongest one there is.

PATIENT H973
I'm taking it in the morning.  Maybe I could take it in the evening.

DOCTOR H973
Technically it’s a 24 hour drug it shouldn't matter.

PATIENT H973
Oh.

DOCTOR H973
You know.

PATIENT H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
But watch the tomato sauce, watch the chocolate. 

PATIENT H973
Yeah.

DOCTOR H973
All the stuff you like. You just said you like Italian @@@.

PATIENT H973
I had @@@ all the list of @@@.

DOCTOR H973
All the @@@ things yeah.

PATIENT H973
@@@.  They told me to put it in my vest.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah.

PATIENT H973
@@@ than I like.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah so.

PATIENT H973
She said moderation, moderation.

DOCTOR H973
Right yeah.  Long-standing reflux can cause problems but at the point you're at I'm not worry about it; it's more just symptoms you know.

PATIENT H973
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H973
Um if you want to hold off on the alendronate, the medication I think that that, you know I can understand at your age if you don’t want to take another drug but I also don't want you falling down and getting a fracture which would be really terrible.

PATIENT H973
And I'm hoping by the time, that you know this will help with getting out, I have to get rid of it one way or, maybe if I start to exercising.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah I think that that's important to helping getting out.

SECOND PERSON H973
What did she say about something about the weaknessthat it could be caused from @@@.

DOCTOR H973
Weakness can be caused by anything.

SECOND PERSON H973
I know that he had something with the iron.

DOCTOR H973
Yeah so you could be iron deficient and us just giving you iron might not be helping much so I'm gonna check the body's iron storage with the blood test.

SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
You know um, weakness is such a vague complaint, it's real hard you know so.  For some things we look for um, for some things it's kind of you know it can be caused from anything from just plain old fatigue and like you said hanging on to a cold for a little period but there's nothing in his labs to make me think that there's something real serious going on but we'll repeat some labs today just to make sure the electrolytes aren’t out of whack.

PATIENT H973
Right now you want me to go to the Lab, so this is for a vitamin deficiency and stuff like that?

DOCTOR H973
Yes.

SECOND PERSON H973
Okay.

DOCTOR H973
