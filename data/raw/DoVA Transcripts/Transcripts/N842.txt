Time of Encounter:  @@@  

PATIENT N842
Hello DOCTOR.

DOCTOR N842
How are you?  You've had kind of an eventful @@@ since the last time I saw you.

PATIENT N842
Good.  So you read my records?

DOCTOR N842
Of course.  @@@.

PATIENT N842
That's good, good, I'm doing good.

DOCTOR N842
You had a little bit of a bleed, sorry that happened.

PATIENT N842
I'm alright.

DOCTOR N842
You were not on aspirin were you?

PATIENT N842
No.

DOCTOR N842
We do not have you on aspirin.  I wanted to make sure that we didn't.  Yeah, you weren't on the aspirin I think.  It was only like six days after I saw you.

PATIENT N842
Yeah.

DOCTOR N842
Did it just happen like that?

PATIENT N842
No actually had had happened was that.

DOCTOR N842
You hit your head?

PATIENT N842
I was uh playing with my grandson.

DOCTOR N842
Oh.

PATIENT N842
And I flipped backwards and I hit my head.

DOCTOR N842
Got it.

PATIENT N842
And uh.

DOCTOR N842
That makes more sense.

PATIENT N842
So I thought uh, well what the heck, you know I've hit my head many times so what's the difference.  So I went to a primary doctor outside and they gave me some painkillers and I was having some headaches on and off until one day I got out of bed and I couldn't even put my foot in my slipper.  I called here and I gave them all the information.  They tell me if that's the case come right up so when they opened my head, there was a previous.

DOCTOR N842
It was an old one.

PATIENT N842
Old one in there but uh they stuck in a drain when I conked my head the headaches stopped.  So I got a drain here and a drain here and.

DOCTOR N842
What did they think the old one was from?

PATIENT N842
I have no idea, wouldn't know, you know.

DOCTOR N842
But they thought they saw some lesions in there.

PATIENT N842
I don't know, that's a lot of them.  My kids know more because for three or four days I had no idea.

DOCTOR N842
How are you feeling now?

PATIENT N842
I feel fine.  I feel fine.  I feel good.  Sometimes I, I don't know when I open my eyes wide open.

DOCTOR N842
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N842
I feel like I'm stretching but all in all I feel, I feel good.

DOCTOR N842
What meds are you on right now?

PATIENT N842
Medication?  Okay I have simvastatin.

DOCTOR N842
Okay.

PATIENT N842
Uh I take a vitamin @@@.

DOCTOR N842
Vitamin D, I have you on vitamin D.

PATIENT N842
This one here was prescribed by the hospital here and I did manage to get an order for the @@@.

DOCTOR N842
Expired.

PATIENT N842
It expired.

DOCTOR N842
So are you taking it?

PATIENT N842
Well you have to decide uh based on my blood pressure.

DOCTOR N842
Right.  I read the note by the neurosurgeon.

PATIENT N842
Yeah.  A little bit high there.

DOCTOR N842
Are you on it now?

PATIENT N842
No.  I haven't taken it for about maybe a couple of weeks.

DOCTOR N842
You've been out for two weeks?

PATIENT N842
Yeah I ran out.

DOCTOR N842
I see your blood pressure is not that bad.  139/73.

PATIENT N842
The nurse that comes to see me a couple of times a month.

DOCTOR N842
Yeah.

PATIENT N842
She says uh my blood pressure is perfect, 120, 123 but it's a little bit hyper sometimes, it depends on you know, I got to tell my wife not to put salt in the food.

DOCTOR N842
139/73, given your other medical problems, I'm not necessarily inclined to treat it, to be honest with you.

PATIENT N842
Okay.

DOCTOR N842
Um you have relatively normal kidney functions um, you're not a diabetic.  The last time you were here you were like 157/90.

PATIENT N842
That was before.

DOCTOR N842
Right and that is why I wanted to start it.

PATIENT N842
Everything, everything is sky-rocketing and everything.

DOCTOR N842
Probably there are probably a lot of reasons for that.

PATIENT N842
Correct, correct.

DOCTOR N842
Even if I were to start you on it, I'll do half that dose okay.  I would do the 12.5 not the 25.

PATIENT N842
Hmm.  I'm taking my blood pressure myself.

DOCTOR N842
When do you check it at home and what is it?  I'll check it again with this cuff.

PATIENT N842
Yeah, probably lower.  Uh sometimes like in hyper, you know 130, 120.

DOCTOR N842
130.

PATIENT N842
Yes, 130, 120, 124, sometimes lower.

DOCTOR N842
How high does it get?

PATIENT N842
Um.

DOCTOR N842
Does it ever hit the 140 range?

PATIENT N842
I think so, I think, not a lot though.

DOCTOR N842
Once, twice.

PATIENT N842
Once, twice.

DOCTOR N842
When?  After activity or?

PATIENT N842
After activity or after yelling at the kids.

DOCTOR N842
So pretty normal reasons.

PATIENT N842
Normal reasons.  But I'm pretty sure it's gonna be lower when you take it now.  I uh, I'll take the medication if I really have to but I'd rather not if I don't.

DOCTOR N842
Okay, alright.

PATIENT N842
Now the other one, the tamsulosin, I'm not taking that.

DOCTOR N842
You're not taking the tamsulosin?

PATIENT N842
No.

DOCTOR N842
You stopped taking the calcium and simvastatin?

PATIENT N842
Correct.

DOCTOR N842
Cause tamsulosin makes you dizzy correct right?

PATIENT N842
Yeah I wasn't feeling too good.

DOCTOR N842
Okay.  And you've been off of that for how long?

PATIENT N842
I would say a couple of months.

DOCTOR N842
Are you still seeing the urologist for the prostate?

PATIENT N842
Yes.  They took the PSA test the other day; they gave me a blood test.

DOCTOR N842
0.35 is what it came back.

PATIENT N842
So that's good.

DOCTOR N842
Good. 

PATIENT N842
Uh.

DOCTOR N842
And you're not have, you're not having more urinary tract symptoms?

PATIENT N842
No.

DOCTOR N842
Okay.

PATIENT N842
I do get up two, three times at night.  I hate that.

DOCTOR N842
Oh you do.

PATIENT N842
Who wouldn't?

DOCTOR N842
Who wouldn't I agree.  I didn't know you were getting up at night.

PATIENT N842
Yeah I did get up.  I feel the pressure you know and I don't have to urinate a lot but, the pressure is there.  It's hard to take a nap in the afternoon to relax me.

DOCTOR N842
(Doctor working on computer)  Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date but did you get a flu shot this year?

PATIENT N842
Uh no, I'm gonna wait on that.

DOCTOR N842
You don't want that then?

PATIENT N842
Uh no, no.

DOCTOR N842
Why not?

PATIENT N842
Well I have mixed reasons.  Every time I take one, I catch a cold.

DOCTOR N842
Okay.

PATIENT N842
And with my uh situation I like to know like, play it cool, or easy.  I don't want to, I know of course you know after these, is this gonna be normal for me, is something gonna change?

DOCTOR N842
What over @@@.

PATIENT N842
With the whole head issue.

DOCTOR N842
But that happened a while ago.

PATIENT N842
It's going on, over 3 1/2 months.

DOCTOR N842
Right @@@.

PATIENT N842
So it should be okay.

DOCTOR N842
It should start cooling down again.

PATIENT N842
Yeah.

DOCTOR N842
You not a drinker?

PATIENT N842
Sometimes I do.

DOCTOR N842
But you're not a smoker if I remember.

PATIENT N842
No, right, about 35 years ago.

DOCTOR N842
I'm just keeping track of some of this stuff I uh.  @@@.

PATIENT N842
I keep myself busy, I keep myself occupied.

DOCTOR N842
You've had a ton of lab work recently so.

PATIENT N842
Yeah.

DOCTOR N842
All in all you're looking a whole lot better than I expected.  After reading some of these notes, I was a little afraid you know.

PATIENT N842
Uh my kids uh were told that it was gonna be uh, not drive for about six months, I'm gonna have to use the walker.

DOCTOR N842
You're walking fine.  You don’t have any neurologic deficits at all?

PATIENT N842
No, no, not at all.  That's why I don't think I need the.

DOCTOR N842
Gotcha.

PATIENT N842
The nurse that comes in, takes my pressure once every other week.  

DOCTOR N842
It's been a while, the thiazide dropped your us….  When did you start taking the thiazide, back in August, the hydrochlorothiazide?

PATIENT N842
Maybe.

DOCTOR N842
In September.

PATIENT N842
You mean for the.

DOCTOR N842
Blood pressure.

PATIENT N842
Oh, that's uh that's here.

DOCTOR N842
Right but that was in September.

PATIENT N842
In late September.

DOCTOR N842
Yeah it dropped your sodium a little bit.

PATIENT N842
My potassium was off, the sodium was off.

DOCTOR N842
Yeah.

PATIENT N842
Blood pressure was.

DOCTOR N842
Let's not restart it unless we absolutely have to now.

PATIENT N842
Okay.

DOCTOR N842
That’s my suggestion.

PATIENT N842
Alright.

DOCTOR N842
You know we should do another cholesterol, I mean you might be due.  So you've been on the simvastatin for a long time?

PATIENT N842
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR N842
Have you been on the same dose?

PATIENT N842
Yes, yes sir.

DOCTOR N842
Half a pill, long-term?

PATIENT N842
I would say six months, not long.

DOCTOR N842
Have they ever increased it?

PATIENT N842
No.

DOCTOR N842
No.  I'm gonna put you on 40 once a day; just take the full 40 once a day.

PATIENT N842
Okay.  The simvastatin?

DOCTOR N842
Yeah instead of half a tab, just take the one tab.

PATIENT N842
Take the one tab.

DOCTOR N842
Yeah, alright.  It probably needs to change, really not change much.

PATIENT N842
Without even checking my blood?

DOCTOR N842
Well they've looked at it back in August.

PATIENT N842
Oh I see, okay.  So you see in the past.

DOCTOR N842
It's a little higher than I probably want it.

PATIENT N842
But everything was off at that time, everything.

DOCTOR N842
Yeah but do you know the cholesterol, it's usually not gonna affect the cholesterol; however, having high cholesterol puts you at risk for strokes.

PATIENT N842
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N842
It's a different type of stroke.  If you’re avid to not do it, you can hold off and then recheck eventually, I'm okay with that.

PATIENT N842
Well it's up to you.

DOCTOR N842
No, we work together here, we're a team.

PATIENT N842
I can have another blood test done, either here or outside and uh we'll uh.

DOCTOR N842
Cause you know what, although we don't treat total, we generally treat the number called the LDL.

PATIENT N842
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N842
You're total is, I'd like it under 200 and it's 205.  The LDL you know @@@ and you do have hypertension and you've had a history of stroke I would theoretically like it @@@ under 100.

PATIENT N842
Alright.

DOCTOR N842
Okay?

PATIENT N842
You the man, you're the doctor.

DOCTOR N842
Okay, so we will go, let's go up to 40.

PATIENT N842
Take the whole thing?

DOCTOR N842
Yes.

PATIENT N842
Okay.

DOCTOR N842
I think, it's not, you're not gonna feel any different.  It's not, if you're feeling, if we checked it and its a little lower, then I think we can just track that down.

PATIENT N842
Okay.

DOCTOR N842
But having a little bit too low of cholesterol with medication is not a bad thing.

PATIENT N842
Okay.

DOCTOR N842
Okay?  

PATIENT N842
So, yeah I do have another bottle, full bottle at home.

DOCTOR N842
Okay, I'll change it, they might send you more but you can always tell them not to.

PATIENT N842
Well you know by taking in half, you know it lasts quite a long time.

DOCTOR N842
So we'll put that in for you today.  You never made it to Greece then.

PATIENT N842
No (laughter).

DOCTOR N842
I'm really sorry about that.  That's a shame.

PATIENT N842
Alright, there's no way.

DOCTOR N842
I was reading here in my notes.  I read it before I came in, return in three montha after patient returns from Greece.

PATIENT N842
Greece yeah and in a way I'm glad I didn't because if I would, if I would have got on the airplane, I probably would have died.

DOCTOR N842
You might have, I think so, you head your head though, would you have hit your head?

PATIENT N842
What do you mean?

DOCTOR N842
Well you said you hit your hit your head a couple of days before you had the symptoms.

PATIENT N842
No that was about maybe a couple of months.

DOCTOR N842
Oh months ago you hit your head.

PATIENT N842
A couple of months before I came here.

DOCTOR N842
Oh so slow.

PATIENT N842
Slowly things @@@.  I heard the bump.

DOCTOR N842
Subdurals are like that.  @@@.

PATIENT N842
Yeah and sometimes at night when I'd be watching TV, I couldn't hold my head someplace normal.  I didn’t know what was going on.

DOCTOR N842
You never told me that at the visit that you were feeling dizzy.

PATIENT N842
Uh.

DOCTOR N842
Did you?

PATIENT N842
I don’t think so.  I wasn't really feeling dizzy.  I was feeling uncomfortable.

DOCTOR N842
Okay.

PATIENT N842
Uncomfortable and I thought it was probably my neck.  I thought it was my neck and I would put heating pads on my neck and I would uh move my head this way and that away and go to bed early.  Like I said until one day I got up and I couldn't put my foot in the slipper.

DOCTOR N842
Wow.

PATIENT N842
Anyway.

DOCTOR N842
Good for you that everything.

PATIENT N842
It worked out okay.

DOCTOR N842
It worked out okay.

PATIENT N842
I uh, I'm thankful the people here, I'm glad I came here because I figured if I would've went outside, by the time those people find out how to get their money or who to contact for my records.

DOCTOR N842
I want get a set of labs first, do you mind?

PATIENT N842
No.

DOCTOR N842
The hemoglobin was a little low and generally everything is coming back normal.  I'll recheck your cholesterol too.  You have to be fasting but that's okay.

PATIENT N842
That's okay.

DOCTOR N842
Its okay, it's not gonna give me the best information but it'll give me some information.

PATIENT N842
Alright.  So I should take the blood test then.

DOCTOR N842
Yeah we'll get some blood @@@.  Um, alright hop up over here.  Since we're done with the chatting, just the exam alright.

PATIENT N842
Okay, should I take anything off?

DOCTOR N842
Yeah, your jacket.

PATIENT N842

DOCTOR N842

PATIENT N842
(Laughter).

DOCTOR N842
Shame on me.  @@@ anything.

PATIENT N842
(Laughter).

DOCTOR N842
Not the devices problem, it's my problem.  I don't like the automated machines they use out there.

PATIENT N842
Oh.

DOCTOR N842
Cause sometimes it doesn't give you accurate numbers.  A little bit higher.

PATIENT N842
What?  What'd you find?

DOCTOR N842
I got like 143/85.

PATIENT N842
Okay.

DOCTOR N842
So we might have to put you on the low dose of that medicine alright?  Um and then in two weeks what we'll do is we'll bring you back for another blood pressure and uh we will check a lab at that time and make sure your potassium and everything is not out of whack.

PATIENT N842

DOCTOR N842
Okay, so we'll get, we should get a baseline today @@@.  Okay?

PATIENT N842
I got to take a blood test today?

DOCTOR N842

DOCTOR N842
I want to make sure everything has kind of gotten better.

PATIENT N842

DOCTOR N842
Okay and for example if that blood pressure medication is doing weird things to your system, we have others okay.

PATIENT N842
It didn't do anything wrong.

DOCTOR N842
Okay.  Well no sometimes it can make the potassium go down, it can slow your heart rate.

PATIENT N842
Oh, oh I see.

DOCTOR N842
We don't want that to happen.

PATIENT N842
Okay.

DOCTOR N842
Okay.

PATIENT N842

PATIENT N842
Today.

DOCTOR N842
But there's gonna be @@@ we need to recheck your blood pressure too.

PATIENT N842
Oh.

DOCTOR N842
To make sure, cause sometimes this medication can cause your sodium to drop.

PATIENT N842
Okay.

DOCTOR N842
And it can cause your potassium to drop.  There are side effects that we keep an eye on, especially given the recent head you know issues, I want to make sure that everything a) is back to normal now and b) it stays normal after we start the meds.

PATIENT N842
Okay.

DOCTOR N842

Like a.

DOCTOR N842
I better remember that.  That sounds very @@@.

PATIENT N842
What that means.

DOCTOR N842
That was closer to what I @@@ when I first got to call you, I was going to say PATIENT

PATIENT N842
PATIENT.

DOCTOR N842
What does that mean?

PATIENT N842
It means when you're facing the sun.

DOCTOR N842
Okay.

PATIENT N842
You're PATIENT, in Greek you know the sun is called idios.

DOCTOR N842
Idios.

PATIENT N842
PATIENT, so if you are facing the sun, you are PATIENT, like sunny side.

DOCTOR N842
Sunny side up.

PATIENT N842
Okay, so that's what, but I think my uh you know people before me, were probably cold and they were waiting for the sun to come up so they warm themselves up so they were facing the sun.  But anyway.

DOCTOR N842
That's very interesting.  I never heard @@@.

PATIENT N842
But uh that's what it is, so I left it.  A lot of people asked me to change it but I wasn't going to change it.

DOCTOR N842
Okay, it's a beautiful name.

PATIENT N842
Leave it alone, thank you very much.

DOCTOR N842

PATIENT N842
Okay doctor.

DOCTOR N842
