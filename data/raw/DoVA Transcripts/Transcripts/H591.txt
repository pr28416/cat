It's more just in the kneecap, inside, like I feel like it's in the bone.

DOCTOR H591
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H591
You know.

DOCTOR H591
I think you've got a little bit of fluid around there.

PATIENT H591
What'd I do injure it or something?

DOCTOR H591
Um, I think you've got some arthritis.

PATIENT H591
Yeah.  Around my elbows hurt a lot too.  They've been hurting.

DOCTOR H591
@@@ overall.

PATIENT H591
Oh.  @@@ work I do @@@.  I don't pick up nothing I can't pick up.  I won't even try it.

DOCTOR H591
Can you take off your socks for me?

PATIENT H591
Sure, I'm sorry I should do it before.

DOCTOR H591
That's okay, no problem.

PATIENT H591
Here's the other thing I do, I forget.  You know it's a bad thing from doing drugs all my life I guess, stupid me.

DOCTOR H591
