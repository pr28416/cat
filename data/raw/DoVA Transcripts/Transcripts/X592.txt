PATIENT X592
Last time he didn't show up.  He got to do something important probably right?  Well DOCTOR prescribed me hydrocodone.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.

PATIENT X592
And because you know sometimes if I don't take the pain medication.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
I can't even get up out of bed.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.

PATIENT X592
Or out on the chair.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
So I don't take more than five a day.  He said he doesn't want my liver to go off but I've been taking my diabetic medications.

DOCTOR X592
Good, good.

PATIENT X592
Diabetes.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
I take one in the morning before I eat a big breakfast like today and then tonight I eat a big dinner.

DOCTOR X592
Okay, okay. 

PATIENT X592
Not too big.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
And I'm start; gradually I'm starting, my weight's going up.

DOCTOR X592
Good.

PATIENT X592
And that's a little bit better.

DOCTOR X592
Your weight um okay.

PATIENT X592
I think they weighed me at 238 but I got about four pounds of clothes on.  The last time I came up here and seen DOCTOR my weight was like 210.

DOCTOR X592
17.

PATIENT X592
Or 217 yeah.

DOCTOR X592
Good job, good job.

PATIENT X592
I feel a little bit better when I put on just a little bit more weight.  I don't know why cause I like to walk a lot and I don't want to get.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.

PATIENT X592
I don't want some wind to come by and blow me away.  But normally I've never had that.

DOCTOR X592
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT X592
I'm down to five cigarettes a day now and it's getting to the point, I was smoking ten.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.  You know what.

PATIENT X592
Now the last time I smoked.  The last time I smoked a cigarette was 7 o'clock this morning and I feel good.  I take a couple shots of albuterol.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
To help me breathe a little bit easier.  I don't know what it is; the climate up there in Chicago is a lot different than where I live at.

DOCTOR X592
Okay you know um.

PATIENT X592
Cause they got a lot of factories around there.

DOCTOR X592
You know why we were concerned because you shouldn't be smoking at all.

PATIENT X592
Huh?

DOCTOR X592
You shouldn't be smoking at all.

PATIENT X592
You know what, I wake up in the morning and I drink a cup of coffee.

DOCTOR X592
Cause you're very lucky, we found the lung cancer early enough.

PATIENT X592
Yeah.

DOCTOR X592
They were able to do surgery on it.

PATIENT X592
Okay now, let me tell you something.

DOCTOR X592
If you keep smoking it's gonna happen again.

PATIENT X592
Yeah, yeah.  I don't want to go through that again.  I want to live at least another 2 1/2, 3 years.  See I have this book that comes out you know, selling through this publication in Oregon.  When I was out there to visit my brother I went to go see, I talked to an agent.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
And uh but anyway that kind of relieves my stress level and worrying about my pain and the condition I'm in.

DOCTOR X592
If you’re stressed you can you know.

PATIENT X592
They were gonna send me over; I went over to see the cardiologist.  I think it was the 19th.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
Or maybe it was the 16th.

DOCTOR X592
You saw the cardiologist.

PATIENT X592
That was the @@@@@@@@@@@@.

DOCTOR X592
You did see them.

PATIENT X592
Okay they said they were gonna set up a surgeon to call me the following week which was the 19th to the 24th and to schedule a meeting or appointment to see a surgeon general up there.  They didn't say a doctor's name.  They said they found, the cardiologist here at the Jesse Brown Medical Center, they said they found a white sac in the center of my heart and it's very hard.  Now if it was cancer you would think it would be black right?

DOCTOR X592
It's a fluid collection.

PATIENT X592
But I was coughing a lot.  I had a cold at that time and I told them I says maybe that was the build-up from being, me having a cold.  Now I went to them and picked up the pain medication and they uh, also DOCTOR in Chicago Heights, she's very courteous, very nice, she prescribed me a face mask for the cold weather that we're gonna be experiencing for the next seven or eight weeks or nine weeks.  They said it was gonna be a very mild winter but I believe that like the Cubs are gonna win the World Series right.  Uh I think it's gonna be a lot colder.  But anyway I see the cardiologist here in two days.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
And they were supposed to set up an appointment, like I said again, that they were gonna you know schedule appointment at the Hines Hospital.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
I know how to get there now.

DOCTOR X592
So did you @@@?

PATIENT X592
They never contacted me.

DOCTOR X592
Really?

PATIENT X592
So this is what I'm gonna tell them Friday I'm gonna tell the you know don't call me up here once a week or twice a week cause I hate that commute.  That's very, very stressful.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
Cause I gotta watch my back most of the time and a lot of game bangers out by the bus terminal while I lived in the Heights and I probably told you that @@@ once before.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
And I'm kind of worried about that so I been seeing doctors down at Chicago Heights and uh now I found out that uh I can't see them anymore because I got the Aetna Better Health Insurance through Medicaid.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
The Welfare Department at Blue Island and they says the doctors won't accept it no more but I was seeing this doctor up there on my back muscle.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
He was working it back in.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
And for two days I felt great, like normal you know.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
And then it popped out again and this feels like I'm grinding against my shoulder blade it goes down.  I don't know, what's that called, something like deviates something like that but the bone that goes in your shoulder down to your ribs.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
And also I found out he told me after they took like ten x-rays they said that they took part of your muscle out in your back.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
And part of your rib to get to your lung.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
And they didn't tell me that you know when I came to in ICU.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
Ten hours after operation.

DOCTOR X592
Hmm, okay.

PATIENT X592
So that's probably why the muscle would not work back up.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.  Alright so.

PATIENT X592
It's probably gonna be like that the rest of my life.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.

PATIENT X592
Plus the doctor in the Heights, I don't think she had any uh really clearance to say it but she says go up there and file for pension.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
Now I know and you know and people that have filed for a pension because I feel like the doctors, when they turn me on my side real quick, that's when the muscle dropped.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
And it hasn't worked itself back up yet.

DOCTOR X592
Have you had physical therapy?

PATIENT X592
No I was getting physical therapy by DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X592
Why don't we try physical therapy here?

PATIENT X592
Huh.

DOCTOR X592
And I'm glad to give you @@@ pain patches @@@.

PATIENT X592
Well he's a pain specialist and he's one of the best they got here in Illinois okay.

DOCTOR X592
Alright yeah.

PATIENT X592
That's why I went to go see him.  

DOCTOR X592
So.

PATIENT X592
But I wondered if I could pick up some Lidoderm patches.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
Which will help me a lot because it helps me with my movement in my middle lateral section and some Absorbase that's right over here.  That's for dry skin and I'm running out and I take a shower twice a day and I put that on because I'm starting to itch and I'm running low so I only use it three, four times a week.  But when I don't apply it, it's a topical cream so to speak and it's, I don't feel like itching my legs.

DOCTOR X592
Hmm.

PATIENT X592
Now I got a vein that goes.

DOCTOR X592
How did you find this doctor?

PATIENT X592
He was referred to me by uh DOCTOR and DOCTOR was referred to me by uh a doctor over would accept Aetna Better Health.

DOCTOR X592
Okay it was through your insurance.

PATIENT X592
And my insurance yeah.  Another rag head.

DOCTOR X592
Okay so this is not VA then?

PATIENT X592
Huh?

DOCTOR X592
This not VA doctors?

PATIENT X592
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
His name is on the back here.

DOCTOR X592
Okay cause right now I think you're.

PATIENT X592
I know, I know.

DOCTOR X592
You probably have too many doctors.

PATIENT X592
You probably feel that.

DOCTOR X592
It's gotten confusing.

PATIENT X592
Now I can't see him no more.

DOCTOR X592
Okay you can't see them anymore.

PATIENT X592
And I called the Aetna Better Health.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.  But it’s okay you can still come here and.

PATIENT X592
Cause so can I get the patches today?

DOCTOR X592
Uh let me ask DOCTOR okay.

PATIENT X592
Okay and then uh if you can get approval for that, I'm sorry, uh and have them maybe ship them out to my address once a month.

DOCTOR X592
@@@.

PATIENT X592
The only reason.

DOCTOR X592
@@@ you're on hydrocodone, do you have enough of that?

PATIENT X592
Well I ran out four or five days ago and I've been in extreme pain.

DOCTOR X592
Okay you ran out of that.

PATIENT X592
I been taking ibuprofen but that's nothing, it's like taking an aspirin.

DOCTOR X592
I'll make sure you have enough of that, alright.  Your blood pressure's a little high today.

PATIENT X592
But DOCTOR at Chicago Heights ordered 120 doses.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
Every two weeks.  Now the pharmacist over here says it would be for 20 days because I don't want you to take more than six a day so six times ten is 60 and ten times, six times ten is 60 again so that's 20 days.

DOCTOR X592
The new dose is.

PATIENT X592
And I eat a lot when I take this medication because it tends to make me nauseous if I don't.  And I don't like to drink milk too much cause it stops me up, plugs me up so to speak.  And I take my Docusate which is a stool softener.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.  Okay.  Alright so what did Oncology say, let’s see?

PATIENT X592
Okay now the doctor in Chicago Heights wants me to make an appointment for Oncology Department.  

DOCTOR X592
Oncology.  You saw them here.

PATIENT X592
Oh that was the cardiologist.  Is that the same thing?

DOCTOR X592
No.  You also saw Oncology in November alright.

PATIENT X592
Okay.

DOCTOR X592
So the good news is.

PATIENT X592
It didn't spread.

DOCTOR X592
Yet.  But then.

PATIENT X592
Because they did a CAT scan.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.

PATIENT X592
And they told me yeah.

DOCTOR X592
But then um there's that fluid collection that you mentioned.

PATIENT X592
Yeah.

DOCTOR X592
Do you know what that is? @@@

PATIENT X592
Could they take a CAT scan today or tomorrow or Friday?

DOCTOR X592
No they already took a CAT scan, it's already @@@.

PATIENT X592
Yeah I mean.

DOCTOR X592
You just need to see the surgeons.  You know the most important thing right now going on?

PATIENT X592
Who?

DOCTOR X592
You know the most important thing right now?  What do you think it is?

PATIENT X592
Smoking.

DOCTOR X592
Yes.  I'm very, very concerned.

PATIENT X592
Yeah.  I believe you.

DOCTOR X592
Do you feel like you need gums or lozenges?

PATIENT X592
What the lozenges?

DOCTOR X592
Like candies or gums, nicotine gums.

PATIENT X592
The gum helps me.

DOCTOR X592
You have that on there?

PATIENT X592
Yeah.  I got uh a couple of boxes at the house.

DOCTOR X592
Well when do you feel anxious?

PATIENT X592
When I.

DOCTOR X592
What if we give you like medicine for anxiety so that you could take that instead of smoking?

PATIENT X592
That might help me.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.

PATIENT X592
Yeah.

DOCTOR X592
Cause I.

PATIENT X592
Other than the Xanax.

DOCTOR X592
I'm so concerned that you're still smoking.

PATIENT X592
Yeah.  Well I'm not smoking that much anymore now.

DOCTOR X592
No it doesn't matter.

PATIENT X592
Right.

DOCTOR X592
It doesn't matter.

PATIENT X592
Right.  One cigarette is worse than.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.

PATIENT X592
Uh no cigarette.

DOCTOR X592
Definitely.  So um you've gone through a lot right now but I don't want you to go through this again alright.

PATIENT X592
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR X592
It's really serious.

PATIENT X592
Is there any possible way that I could transfer out to Portland, Oregon?

DOCTOR X592
You want to move there?

PATIENT X592
Like April 1st or at least by May 1st.

DOCTOR X592
Are you planning to move there?

PATIENT X592
Yeah.

DOCTOR X592
I mean that's possible @@@.

PATIENT X592
Cause the weather over there, it rains a lot but that's good for me though.

DOCTOR X592
Okay well it's up to you.

PATIENT X592
There's more condensation.

DOCTOR X592
It's up to you if you want to live in Oregon.

PATIENT X592
I figured if I pass away I'll be around my brother.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah and they have VAs over there you know.

PATIENT X592
And you know last time I went in the @@@ I mean conditional fit.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
Because I thought you know.

DOCTOR X592
So when do you think you're gonna move if you ever?

PATIENT X592
Well if I can get a clearance from the cardiologist or the surgeon over at Hines Hospital to move out there and then register with the VA Hospital in Portland, Oregon.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
Uh.

DOCTOR X592
But pretty soon.

PATIENT X592
If worst come to worse they'll probably have to use a laser to cut that center of that white sac out.

DOCTOR X592
Right.  So I mean.

PATIENT X592
And I'm not afraid of the surgery.

DOCTOR X592
Do you want to complete your, do that here and then move to Oregon or do you want it at that location?

PATIENT X592
It's gonna take about six months here.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh but you wanted to get that done in Oregon.

PATIENT X592
Right, right, right.  Cause I've been saving up some money you know and uh.

DOCTOR X592
So you're planning to move pretty soon.

PATIENT X592
Yeah.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.  Alright well.

PATIENT X592
Well I'll be @@ in 72 days from now.

DOCTOR X592
Okay and you have a, you've been there and everything?

PATIENT X592
Oh yeah, I can get a studio apartment and I can bring my cat with me.  My cat keeps me alive.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
If it wasn't for my cat I'd have been dead a long time ago.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah all the VA's have access to your information.

PATIENT X592
Right and then.

DOCTOR X592
And then.

PATIENT X592
Like they got a bus that leaves the town, it's high up in the mountains.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah and then we can send you like all the copies so you can bring it to the new doctor.

PATIENT X592
Yeah cause I'm gonna, I got the medical records up to three months ago.

DOCTOR X592
Okay, okay.

PATIENT X592
So I can show my parole officer.

DOCTOR X592
Alright.

PATIENT X592
Now when I see the cardiologist Friday, I'm sorry to cut you off but uh I'm in a kind of time scan right now but uh.

DOCTOR X592
Right yeah so let's take care of the @@@ surgery at Hines so for you and they'll make a recommendation.

PATIENT X592
Okay and see DOCTOR.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.

PATIENT X592
About the Lidoderm.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah talk to him about the Lidoderm patches and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT X592
Alright.  I hope you make it fast.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.

PATIENT X592
Uh if he's busy I can't do nothing about that.

(DOCTOR OUT:  43:12  DOCTOR IN:  63:24)

DOCTOR X592
No that's fine.

PATIENT X592
I'm just talking to myself that's all.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.  So um we don't have the patches here but we have the ointment.

PATIENT X592
The what?

DOCTOR X592
Ointment.

PATIENT X592
Oh yeah that stuff burns.

DOCTOR X592
No not the capsaicin, the Lidocaine.

PATIENT X592
Oh okay.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.

PATIENT X592
Lidocaine, is that like in a blue box or?

DOCTOR X592
I don't know but it's the same thing as the Lidoderm patches, except that one's in a patch form and this is in the ointment.

PATIENT X592
Okay right, right, right.

DOCTOR X592
@@@.  But the thing with the ointment, you know the patches you don't have to like; you know it just comes in one patch.

PATIENT X592
Right 12 hours take it off.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.  The ointment you have to make sure that you're putting it on the, like right amount.

PATIENT X592
Right.

DOCTOR X592
And you're not overdosing yourself.

PATIENT X592
Okay so it's not a thin coating it's enough to.

DOCTOR X592
You just put a very thin coat.

PATIENT X592
Okay a thin coat.

DOCTOR X592
Alright.

PATIENT X592
Yeah cause I was doing that with the other medicated cream and it was burning my back for days.

DOCTOR X592
Oh the capsaicin.

PATIENT X592
Oh that was burning me too much.

DOCTOR X592
Okay we'll stop that then.  It wasn't helping with the pain at all?

PATIENT X592
No, it was just burning me.  I couldn't sleep at night and I couldn't uh.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
Move around.  They said well after you take it for a week it'd be alright.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
But I don't want to be in pain for, on fire so to speak, for a week.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.  And then you know we're gonna stop the Vicodin, the hydrocodone and then we're gonna start you on something stronger okay.  So I want you to see, I want you to come back in a month to get a refill on that.

PATIENT X592
For what?

DOCTOR X592
Morphine alright.

PATIENT X592
I think I know what you're talking about.

DOCTOR X592
Take it twice a day and it's much stronger than, so I'll renew the Vicodin, you can still take the Vicodin as needed.

PATIENT X592
Can you leave like that for a month?

DOCTOR X592
Yeah a month and then you'd have to see me.

PATIENT X592
Then I can come up here and pick it up after I see you a month later.

PATIENT X592
That's gonna be a long time but that's alright.

DOCTOR X592

Sometimes it goes down to 90 and I feel real.

DOCTOR X592

PATIENT X592
Okay.  I promise you.  As a matter of fact I'll throw them away as soon as I get outside, maybe give them to someone else who wants to smoke.

DOCTOR X592
Just throw them away, don't let anyone else smoke either.

PATIENT X592
Yeah I might as well, as soon as I get home I'll get rid of all the ashtrays and I got two lighters.

PATIENT X592
They cut my TV out yesterday, my cable so I got to get cable from a different company I kind of.

DOCTOR X592
Oh.

PATIENT X592
Like to watch news in the morning, it kind of relaxes me.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
But you know what they say nowadays, no news is good news.

DOCTOR X592
That's true.  I feel like when I watch the news it's kind of disgusting sometimes.

PATIENT X592
And there's more fun when it comes to a conclusion.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X592
Than to justify it.

DOCTOR X592
Yeah.  So you're gonna get that CT yeah.

PATIENT X592

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
Does that make sense?

DOCTOR X592
Sure it makes sense @@@.

PATIENT X592
As you get older you got more time to sit and I know these travel people over here, they're a joke.  I called up a person a couple hours ago.  They gave me a number and that's been almost a month now.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.

PATIENT X592
I'm living on a very, very low income.  They're only giving me so much money and they have my rent $50 a month so that's kind of, what'd you lose?

DOCTOR X592
My pen.

PATIENT X592
Your pen.

DOCTOR X592
Uh-huh.  @@@.

PATIENT X592

DOCTOR X592
That's okay I'll see you back in a month.

PATIENT X592
I chew that nicotine gum too that helps.

DOCTOR X592
Alright.

PATIENT X592
And I walk a lot and that helps because I don't want to stop and light up you know and then continue to walk cause that's not good either.

DOCTOR X592
Okay.  Let me see how much Lidoderm.

PATIENT X592
It was 30 patches a month and uh.

DOCTOR X592
@@@.

PATIENT X592
They only gave me one box because the price of one box is $253 and I can see why the government won't give it to me now and now I know.  Maybe when I get out to Portland, Oregon I can see about getting some.  I don't think my back's gonna get any better than what it is.

DOCTOR X592
Hmm.  So I'm gonna give you 60 tablets.  You should get it like at 9:00 a.m. in the morning and 9:00 p.m. in the evening okay and I'll refill the Vicodin so if you still have pain you can take that.  But don't take more than four pills a day.

I developed a rash on my stomach and it spread and then once, like a month later after it cleared up if I wore a chain or a thing I mean a ring on my finger or the belt buckle against the skin of my stomach I'd break out instantly.
