Uh let's see well uh, um, I wanted to check on my medications.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.

PATIENT Q587
You know what I've been having trouble with my back and my shoulder and my wife takes Celebrex so we tried, I used some Celebrex and it went away and then I quit taking it and it came back and then I used a few more and it went away.

DOCTOR Q587
Celebrex huh.

PATIENT Q587
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q587
You're not taking that here?

PATIENT Q587

DOCTOR Q587
Is it arthritis pain or just.

PATIENT Q587

DOCTOR Q587
Is it a new kind of pain?

PATIENT Q587
Well.

DOCTOR Q587
Is it a new kind of pain or just like before?

PATIENT Q587
I used to take it occasionally, I mean I would take Aleve before I'd play golf and it would help.

DOCTOR Q587
It would help?

PATIENT Q587
And now I haven't taken any Aleve since I take the Celebrex.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.

PATIENT Q587
So it has to, my shoulder and my back it must be and I do see a chiropractor.

PATIENT Q587
Well I take uh; I started off with actually years and years and years ago when it first came out, the Prilosec.

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah.

PATIENT Q587
And now I take the omeprazole which is cheaper.

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah and it works better.

PATIENT Q587
And it works just as fine, actually every three years I have a scope done with my.

DOCTOR Q587
Outside doctors.

PATIENT Q587
Uh outside doctor.

DOCTOR Q587
Looks like you're due in @@@@ so next year you'll get that.

PATIENT Q587

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah.

PATIENT Q587
And I have a machine.

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah.

PATIENT Q587
This morning I took it, it was 140 something over 66.

DOCTOR Q587
So you didn't take your meds yet right?

PATIENT Q587
No I hadn't taken any meds but I took it this morning just to compare with what would happen here.

DOCTOR Q587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q587
You know it's 139/70.

DOCTOR Q587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q587
And uh you know.

DOCTOR Q587
That's, that's borderline.  You don't have heart disease, you don't have diabetes right?

PATIENT Q587
No.

DOCTOR Q587
So what's the goal for you.  The goal for you is to be less than 140/80.  You're borderline.

PATIENT Q587
Yeah I want to be.

DOCTOR Q587
Right so I would rather you be in the 130s.

PATIENT Q587
So would I.

DOCTOR Q587
So the fact that you didn't take your medicine today.

PATIENT Q587
Yeah but.

DOCTOR Q587
And if that's the.

PATIENT Q587
I don't usually take my blood pressure early.  I usually take it in the afternoon.

DOCTOR Q587
Right, right and the fact that you haven't been taking the lisinopril, cause the lisinopril will drop your blood pressure too.  

PATIENT Q587
Okay.

DOCTOR Q587
So that could be the reason.

PATIENT Q587
When should I take, when should I take the lisinopril?

DOCTOR Q587
In the morning, take it in the morning.

PATIENT Q587
With the other pill too?

DOCTOR Q587
Uh-huh.  Take the lisinopril and if you feel lightheaded or dizzy check your blood pressure and if it's too low like too low.

PATIENT Q587
But it'll never be low.

DOCTOR Q587
Less than 100s then you can call me and I'll have you come back in about two weeks okay uh for blood pressure checks and we'll see where we are.

PATIENT Q587
Uh can I do that on the 19th?

DOCTOR Q587
Sure.  Do you have an appointment then?

PATIENT Q587
Cause I have an appointment with the dermatologist.

DOCTOR Q587
Why don't you, fine.  You come on the 19th uh for a blood pressure check and then get your labs too.  I want to check one more thing.  I know you had it this morning.  Your cholesterol was fine.

PATIENT Q587
Everything's fine?  Blood sugar.

DOCTOR Q587
Your cholesterol was fine.  Your blood sugar is okay.  The only thing is I need to know your BNP, your kidney function and everything which was not checked today.  So you'll come back the 19th, you'll get lab draws.

PATIENT Q587
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Q587
Now do you see a primary care doctor on the outside too or is it just the chiropractor?

Well I had some pain, every once.  I got hurt when I was a kid and I got uh, um, so I go to the chiropractor uh quite often.

DOCTOR Q587
Does it help?

PATIENT Q587
And I think it's getting a little arthritic.

DOCTOR Q587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q587
So I was trying to um keep my golf game going.

DOCTOR Q587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q587
And then I uh and I got uh to where I've had to take Aleve.

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah.

PATIENT Q587
Oh I scratched a thing there.

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah.

PATIENT Q587
There was a little spot there and I was sitting here and I scratched it.

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah, go ahead and sit up.

PATIENT Q587
So I did the um so I, my wife said why don't you try one of my Celebrex.

DOCTOR Q587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q587
So I took.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.

PATIENT Q587
I took it for two days.

DOCTOR Q587
And it really helped you?

PATIENT Q587
And it helped so then I thought well, so I went off.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.

PATIENT Q587
And then it came back.

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah right.

PATIENT Q587
And then I took it again and it went away.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.  So we have the hip pain right here, where is it?

PATIENT Q587
It's back in here, back here, right about in here.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay alright.  Does it go anywhere or does it stay there?

PATIENT Q587

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.  No numbness, no tingling in the legs?

PATIENT Q587
No.

DOCTOR Q587
No pain traveling down your legs?

PATIENT Q587
No.

DOCTOR Q587
No weight loss?

PATIENT Q587
Well you know I used to drive a lot when I was in uh when I was working.  I had, I worked a lot in the car.

DOCTOR Q587
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q587
So my leg would get sore.

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah.

PATIENT Q587
So I, this might all be related you know but uh when I gave up my sales, I had to drive for sales and when I stopped doing that it kind of went away.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.  No bowel, no bladder incontinence like trouble, no nothing like that.

PATIENT Q587
No.

DOCTOR Q587
No um kind of numbness in the genital area, nothing like that?

PATIENT Q587
No.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.

PATIENT Q587
No I'm good.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay alright.  So it's the same kind of pain that you've had for years but it's just like you were taking Aleve.

PATIENT Q587
I was taking Aleve or um Advil.

DOCTOR Q587
But @@@ more.

PATIENT Q587
That kind of stuff and.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.

PATIENT Q587
And uh.

DOCTOR Q587
Alright.

PATIENT Q587
Now I haven't been taking any Aleve, no Advil.

DOCTOR Q587
Have you, have you been checking um or has anyone gotten like an x-ray of that area?

PATIENT Q587
Well my chiropractor.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.

PATIENT Q587
Oh yeah, yeah cause he works on it.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.

PATIENT Q587
I think it's something that uh um when I was a kid I had a bout with some railroad ties, lifting railroad ties and that part of my back went out.

DOCTOR Q587
Umm okay.

PATIENT Q587
And every once in a while if I turn the wrong way I can hurt it.

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah.

PATIENT Q587
I mean it's just like if you're off balance and you lean some way, you know and it goes right back to that same spot.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.

PATIENT Q587
You know.

DOCTOR Q587
Okay.

PATIENT Q587
But I think that because of all this, it's probably become arthritic.

DOCTOR Q587
Hmm.

PATIENT Q587
So you think the uh, this lisinopril or whatever might, might help the swelling down too?

DOCTOR Q587
The what, the lisinopril?

PATIENT Q587
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q587
No, no.

PATIENT Q587
What's causing the swelling in the ankles?

DOCTOR Q587
You know um I don't, I mean.  Sometimes one of your medicines can, the nifedipine can do it, nifedipine might do it.

PATIENT Q587
It just seems like it didn't start for uh till about I don't know.

DOCTOR Q587
It's new.

PATIENT Q587
Last December or January.

DOCTOR Q587
You know it should not, I don't know, it shouldn't.

I got to remember not to wear shorts when I come back.  It's too cold in here.

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah.  Um, um so one thing is um, I'll send you the lisinopril.  Unfortunately I was asking one of the doctors who's worked here for a longer time than I did.  I am um; they say that Celebrex we have to get special approval because it's expensive and you know how.

PATIENT Q587
Okay.

DOCTOR Q587
Especially at the VA.  So let me, let me try to get that for you okay.  I can put in a consult through the system.  They'll review it and they'll let me know if you can get it for you.  Some patients are on it, I can make sure that you know.

PATIENT Q587

DOCTOR Q587
In your case it's indicated which I think it is, but I'll let you know but if not you can always ask your outside doctor to prescribe it for you too.  But I'll let you know though.

PATIENT Q587

DOCTOR Q587
Yeah if you start, again if you start, if you start to feel that you know propping them up isn't helping as much or if you have any numbness or tingling and you think it's getting bigger, call me and let me know.  I think it's a little bit of that medicine that you're on.  Nifedipine, it can give you a little bit of swelling so.

PATIENT Q587
The one I take after lunch?

DOCTOR Q587
I just don't know which one, nifedipine that's the and uh.

PATIENT Q587
It's uh yeah it's uh.
