Time of Encounter:  @@@@@  

DOCTOR M153
PATIENT?

PATIENT M153
Ah that's me.

DOCTOR M153
Here you go.

PATIENT M153
(Laughter).  Good to meet you.

DOCTOR M153
Uh, nice meeting you.  @@@ there.  Alright, what brings you here today?

PATIENT M153
Uh, last time I talked to the pharmacist, I mentioned to her that uh I have some shaking in my hands.

DOCTOR M153
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M153
Eating like vegetables or soup.  Sometimes half the vegetables don't make it to my mouth.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah.

PATIENT M153
And uh, it's quite noticeable at times um, that's why I can say it into my head, like a plate and I put an empty coke can or something on it.

DOCTOR M153
Ummm.

PATIENT M153
And it's moving.

DOCTOR M153
You live in a house?

PATIENT M153
Yeah.

DOCTOR M153
Uh when do you see DOCTOR, October huh?

PATIENT M153
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M153
Alright.  How long have you noticed this problem?

PATIENT M153
Oh it's been a while but I've never really paid attention to it until people start putting it out to me.

DOCTOR M153
Umm.

PATIENT M153
When they see the peas dropping off the fork or whatever.

DOCTOR M153
Alright, you've got diabetes, hypertension, uh reflux, gout and diabetes, that's about it?

PATIENT M153
That pretty much covers it all.

DOCTOR M153
Alrighty.  Um and uh the shakiness, you came in specifically because of the shakiness.

PATIENT M153
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M153
Is that right?  Okay, um.  Now the shakiness you feel like it uh happens all the time or specific times?

PATIENT M153
No it's pretty much all the time now uh.  I notice it when I, I don't have my @@@, when I'm holding, even holding a fork eating or something and I was resting on this finger here and it's gone.  I know I have arthritis in these two fingers but I've got this started and I just take an aspirin for that I guess so.  I don't think they're related and I noticed recently that I had to throw a ball with one of my nephews and I have some kind of pain in here where I can't throw it overhand like a normal person would be, I have to throw underhand.  I don't know if the two are related or not but.

DOCTOR M153
That's probably separate.

PATIENT M153
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR M153
What would guess would be the first you noticed that tremor.  Did you think it'd be about a month, year, when?

PATIENT M153
Uh six months.

DOCTOR M153
Six months yeah.  Um, @@@ or anything like that?

PATIENT M153
What, oh no, @@@.

DOCTOR M153
(Laughter).  Uh any problems with numbness, tingling, headaches?

PATIENT M153
No, no that's all good.  A little short of breath but that's because of the weight more than anything else.

DOCTOR M153
Okay.  Um any problems, how are your blood sugars, are they well controlled?

PATIENT M153
It was 119 this morning so.

DOCTOR M153
Good.  Do they ever get low?

PATIENT M153
That's pretty good for me.

DOCTOR M153
That's pretty good?

PATIENT M153
Yeah, I wouldn't say if I, it was 119, if it was 199 I would tell you.

DOCTOR M153
But you don't ever notice if they're uh @@@.

PATIENT M153
Yeah, they fluctuate occasionally, sure they do.

DOCTOR M153
No problem but uh, it's not like it's related to your blood sugars getting low.

PATIENT M153
No, no, nothing like that.

DOCTOR M153
Okay.

PATIENT M153
Cause I've had diabetes since '92 and uh never had that problem till recently.

DOCTOR M153
Okay and your blood sugars are usually what?

PATIENT M153
Well it was 119 this morning and they'll vary in the 140-150 range sometimes, you know depending on when I take them.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah uh and how about, you usually take your blood sugar before breakfast?

PATIENT M153
Right now I take it definitely in the morning after fasting and sometimes before dinner, sometimes two hours after dinner, @@@.

DOCTOR M153
@@@ range before breakfast.

PATIENT M153
Well breakfast is usually in the, in the maybe in the 130 and below.

DOCTOR M153
Okay.

PATIENT M153
And afterwards, after dinner it's always higher than it is before dinner.  If I take two hours after dinner it could be maybe 180, 170.

DOCTOR M153
Uh-huh.  How about before dinner?

PATIENT M153
Before dinner it's down in the 140-50 range probably, depending on if I had a snack or not then depending what that snack was.

DOCTOR M153
Okay.  Yeah.  Um, blood pressure a little bit on the high side, you're very â€¦  Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home or anything like that?

PATIENT M153
Hmm, yes I do.

DOCTOR M153
I'm gonna have you run it at home.

PATIENT M153
Okay.

DOCTOR M153
Do you know what the numbers usually look like?

PATIENT M153
Uh, top number is in the 140 to 170 range usually.

DOCTOR M153
Uh-huh.  They're usually kind of high.  You know what it's supposed to be?

PATIENT M153
Supposed to be under 140 I believe.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah and even um, you know for diabetics you have to change that because they found that it's even better to keep it below 130.  You know normal blood pressure, like a healthy young person is maybe like 120/80 uh so.  Yeah we want to keep it below 130 even so.  We have to do something with that.  Uh did you take all your medications this morning?

PATIENT M153
Yes I did.

DOCTOR M153
Okay and uh are there any other problems?

PATIENT M153
Hmmm, my knee but I had my knee replaced last year and it never growed scar tissue on it so it's pretty much like it was.

DOCTOR M153
Uh-huh and uh, let's see here.  Any medical problems in your family?

PATIENT M153
Uh my brother has diabetes but he takes care of himself and his medicines already been cut in half so.  Goes to the gym four days a week and works out so.

DOCTOR M153
@@@.

PATIENT M153
He's in good shape.  Mom's okay.  She's 83, still works a day a week so.

DOCTOR M153
Uh-huh.  And any history of tremors in your family?

PATIENT M153
Nothing.

DOCTOR M153
Nope.

PATIENT M153
Nothing that I know of.

DOCTOR M153
Does it seem to affect any part of your body more, your arms, hands, feet?

PATIENT M153
Uh just this, the hands it seems like.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah.  Okay we already talked gout@@@.

PATIENT M153
No, no.  Circulations okay, eyes are okay.

DOCTOR M153
Alrighty.  Well let's see if we can go over your most recent labs, back in September you had uh, blood sugars weren't that great.  You're hemoglobin A1c uh the last one we had was in August, that one is 10.2%, which uh is kind of high.

PATIENT M153
@@@ again.

DOCTOR M153
Okay I'll, no that's a lot worse than it was in 2008, it was like 7.9% in 2008.  Uh, did you notice your blood sugars getting better since then or not really?

PATIENT M153
It's all related.

DOCTOR M153
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M153
I mean it depends on uh; right now I'm looking for a job.  I left Florida, came up here.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah.

PATIENT M153
And I usually just do the opposite but uh, my mom's up here and I figured she's getting on in age, I need to be a little closer to her.

DOCTOR M153
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M153
And uh I.

DOCTOR M153
She's in Florida?

PATIENT M153
No she's up here.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah.

PATIENT M153
I was in Florida.

DOCTOR M153
Okay.

PATIENT M153
And uh came up, closed my business, came up here and uh job search is really frustrating.

DOCTOR M153
Alright.

PATIENT M153
So that might, the stress might have something to do with it.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah, yeah.  How about problems with getting your medications, is that ever a problem?

PATIENT M153
Oh no.

DOCTOR M153
No okay.  And how much insulin are you taking now?

PATIENT M153
Uh 80 twice a day.

DOCTOR M153
Of the uh.

PATIENT M153
70/30.

DOCTOR M153
You're on 70/30 alright.  80 units huh.  Has anyone ever talked to you about trying a different regimen?

PATIENT M153
As far as insulin or?

DOCTOR M153
Yeah.

PATIENT M153
When I first started out I was on uh, gosh back in the old 90s, Humulin or something like that.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah.

PATIENT M153
But then I've been on 70/30 for quite a while.

DOCTOR M153
Okay.

PATIENT M153
I don't know if it would make a difference then.

DOCTOR M153
It's possible, @@@.  Cause you know 70/30 is good for some things um.  If you have problems, you know it's all in one, so sometimes it's harder to adjust things more carefully if we need to.  I mean it sounded like you might have been, sounds like you were better controlled before so maybe there is a way we can keep you on the same regimen.  Uh, and you never get, you don't get low as you said huh?

PATIENT M153
No, occasionally I'll get a low but that's so rare.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah, you ever adjust the insulin at all or hold it for?

PATIENT M153
No, no, I just do what I'm supposed to.  I don't mess with it.

DOCTOR M153
You take regular meals and everything?

PATIENT M153
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M153
Okay.  Uh let's see.  Sounds like you're, so your afternoon and dinner ones are a little bit higher.

PATIENT M153
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M153
So we could probably go up a little bit on your uh, let's see your morning dosage.  Have you always taken the same amount in the morning?

PATIENT M153
No they just raised it recently from 76 to 80.

DOCTOR M153
That helps.

PATIENT M153
I haven't got exactly a blood test with the 80 though.

DOCTOR M153
It'll help.  Alrighty and you're staying here then right?

PATIENT M153
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M153
Okay.

PATIENT M153
I'm fixing to go back and get my degree.

DOCTOR M153
Okay, well good.  What kind of work do you, have you been doing?

PATIENT M153
I'm an investigator since '73.

DOCTOR M153
Investigator?

PATIENT M153
Correct.  

DOCTOR M153
Uh, that's helpful.  @@@.  Have you ever had any feet problems at all.

PATIENT M153
No I saw the podiatrist this morning.

DOCTOR M153
Oh good.  Did they do any clipping or anything?

PATIENT M153
Yeah they did all that.

DOCTOR M153
Good.

PATIENT M153
Including the blood and the stuck me and.

DOCTOR M153
Alright.  No ultrasound there?

PATIENT M153
No, I'm only there cause just for diabetic @@@.

DOCTOR M153
Do you have any problems with @@@ on your feet?

PATIENT M153
No nothing at all, just a little dryness across the soles so.

DOCTOR M153
(Doctor taking blood pressure).  Okay, the number I got was a little bit better 140/60.

PATIENT M153
I always get a better reading with the manual.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah I think so.

PATIENT M153
Than the other kind.

DOCTOR M153
Um, so you said you check it at home and it's high at home too.

PATIENT M153
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M153
I think.

PATIENT M153
I don't check it every day you know, I check it when I feel I need it self medicating I know is not right.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah, we'll look at that.  I think we still need to, @@@.  I think we don't have to check it every single day, that's fine.

PATIENT M153
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M153
Uh I think we'll go up on your blood pressure medication, what you're on right now, triamterene um, hydrochlorothiazide and.

PATIENT M153
Yeah we just went up on one.

DOCTOR M153
@@@.

PATIENT M153
In the last month we went up on the HCTZ from a half to one.

DOCTOR M153
Mmm.  

PATIENT M153
Something like that roughly.

DOCTOR M153
Oh down at the Pharmacy, right.

PATIENT M153
Correct yeah.

DOCTOR M153
I think those are all maximum doses, let me check.

PATIENT M153
Good.

DOCTOR M153
Have you been on other blood pressure medications in the past?

PATIENT M153
Oh not in a long time since I've been on this for quite a while.  I can't even remember what I was on before.

DOCTOR M153
You are @@@ maximum dose, I think it's 100 mg.  @@@ amlodipine.  Have you ever been on something like metoprolol before?

PATIENT M153
Doesn't sound familiar.

DOCTOR M153
No, or atenolol?

PATIENT M153
No.

DOCTOR M153
No.  And any problems like lightheadedness or dizziness or anything like that?

PATIENT M153
Nothing out of the ordinary you know, occasionally a little bit here and there when I exert myself too much.

DOCTOR M153
@@@.

PATIENT M153
But nothing that I would really think is important to.

DOCTOR M153
Alright, as far as the tremor um you know it's most likely just a essential tremor what we call, which is something that is not a big deal.  Yeah that's a pretty small amount.  But use this hand to touch my finger @@@ touch your nose; now touch your nose, finger, nose, finger, nose, this finger, nose.  Good. Um and uh you like, @@@ screwing in light bulbs, look right here and touch the hand.  Okay, alright.  Um and basically you know it's not a huge deal.  Does it bother you at all with your work or anything @@@?

PATIENT M153
No, not really uh but it is sometimes embarrassing in a restaurant.

DOCTOR M153
Okay, yeah.  What we can do is we can put you on a medication that's a, propranolol and what that can do, it's actually a blood pressure medication as well so it could help with your blood pressure at the same time as the tremors and sometimes it helps a little bit in regard to the tremors.  Um you know there are different things that could the tremor would be just an essential tremor which happens to pretty much some of the population.  It's not really a big deal.

PATIENT M153
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M153
Um, are you a drinker or anything?

PATIENT M153
Very rarely.

DOCTOR M153
Very rarely okay.

PATIENT M153
A glass of wine when I watch a ballgame or something.

DOCTOR M153
Sometimes something werid causes the tremors but uh some other stuff but I don't think anything else is going on because you're pretty healthy um.  You know you could get, you could get like Parkinson's or something like that but you know that's a little bit differently.

PATIENT M153
Yeah well that was in the back of my mind.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah, you don't need to be worried about it, no.  It doesn't, there is nothing about anything telling me that suggests that, so I think we'll call it essential tremor basically.  But we'll try some of the propranolol and see if that helps with both your blood pressure and uh also the uh uh tremor okay?

PATIENT M153
Okay, is that in lieu of the amlodipine?

DOCTOR M153
Continue all the other ones.

PATIENT M153
@@@.

DOCTOR M153
This will be in addition to those.

PATIENT M153
Okay.

DOCTOR M153
And uh, have you had a colonoscopy before?

PATIENT M153
Yeah.

DOCTOR M153
Uh when was that?

PATIENT M153
Uh when I turned 50, ten years ago.

DOCTOR M153
Good and did they find anything?

PATIENT M153
No.

DOCTOR M153
Nope.  And did they tell you when to get another time you need a basic one?

PATIENT M153
Well they never really said, you know just consult with your physician.

DOCTOR M153
That's something, yeah it could be every ten years if it was normal so.  Uh, so you would be due for that um.  It's okay with going ahead with that at some point in the future?

PATIENT M153
Well I'm sure, you know if they think it's necessary.  It's not the most fun thing to do.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah I'm sure it isn't um.  So I can uh, so your due for your labs um.  Did you eat anything, yeah you probably ate something.

PATIENT M153
Yeah, yeah I did, I have to.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah.

PATIENT M153
Yeah I'm due on Monday; I'm ready for my labs.

DOCTOR M153
Okay Monday, so I'll order blood and we'll check a couple other, like blood labs for the colonoscopy people.

PATIENT M153
Okay.

DOCTOR M153
And I'll put the consult in for the colonoscopy.

PATIENT M153
Okay.

DOCTOR M153
And they'll contact you to get it set up.

PATIENT M153
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M153
Um, there's no rush you can do that later.

PATIENT M153
Um.  Down in Florida they replaced my knee course so if there's a problem with it, and it never worked out right but they also said I needed surgery on my shoulder here uh, do I need to see @@@ for that, just as a consult, not that I necessarily want the surgery I'd like.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah sure.

PATIENT M153
To have them look at it.

DOCTOR M153
Um, uh, did you have surgery on your shoulder before?

PATIENT M153
No, no.

DOCTOR M153
No okay.  Um.

PATIENT M153
But they did the MRI and the whole thing.

DOCTOR M153
Oh they did okay.

PATIENT M153
They gave me the choice of my knee or my shoulder.

DOCTOR M153
In Florida right.

PATIENT M153
Right.

DOCTOR M153
The Florida VA?

PATIENT M153
Right down in uh Tampa.

DOCTOR M153
Okay.  So the, I'll put in a consult and they should be able to dig up the records from Florida.

PATIENT M153
Okay.

DOCTOR M153
Uh, so they said that they want to do surgery?

PATIENT M153
They said I needed surgery on both uh cause I had like four knee surgeries so they replaced my knee and they asked if I wanted my knee replaced or my shoulder done and I.

DOCTOR M153
They want to do a lot of stuff on you.

PATIENT M153
Oh yeah I feel like the Six Million Dollar man, which is not a lot these days but uh.  The knee never worked right and it still doesn't because they never broke the scar tissue throughout the rehab, they couldn't break it.

DOCTOR M153
Mmmm.

PATIENT M153
And uh I need, I'd like to talk to them about that also.

DOCTOR M153
Um sounds good.  Uh would you like your medication, um do you want to pick it up today or just have it mailed to you, the new one for the tremor and the blood pressure?

PATIENT M153
Uh I guess I'll just have it mailed to me, that'd be fine.

DOCTOR M153
Yeah.

PATIENT M153
As long as they got the right address, they've been sending my mail down, my prescriptions last time down to Florida.

DOCTOR M153
Took a while?

PATIENT M153
Yeah.

DOCTOR M153
Uh ADDRESS?

PATIENT M153
Right ADDRESS.

DOCTOR M153
ADDRESS.  And then I'll forward this note to DOCTOR, who you'll be seeing.

PATIENT M153
Okay, oh good, I'm glad.  How she doing?

DOCTOR M153
Oh I don't know, oh did she have a baby?

PATIENT M153
Yeah she did.

DOCTOR M153
Oh okay, I'm not sure how much time she's taking off, maybe you won't see her.  If not you can schedule an appointment with me.

PATIENT M153
Okay.

DOCTOR M153
Uh but uh I think what we'll do is we'll have you come back in, so you have those labs done on Monday.

PATIENT M153
Right.

DOCTOR M153
I'll call you with the results, if I'm not sure what's gonna happen, so in a day or so I'll call you, @@@ call and then uh.  Oh @@@ calling you back for that.  I'll take a look at @@@.

PATIENT M153
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR M153
