I think I'm fine doctor.  

DOCTOR L929
Let me just pull up your computer.

DOCTOR L929
Okay. 

PATIENT L929
Ya'll give me them pills and I'm here.

DOCTOR L929
Uh you were in the hospital a little while ago for some diarrhea?

PATIENT L929
Yes.

DOCTOR L929
Is that gone?

PATIENT L929
It's been gone the day after they discharged me and I only took that pill for one time and then everything was gone and I just don't take it the next morning cause so far, so good.

DOCTOR L929
Good.

PATIENT L929
And I see I have those pills left.

DOCTOR L929
Okay.

PATIENT L929
Save them for another day or something.  I hope I never have to do it.  I wonder what happened.  Maybe it something I ate I guess, I don't know.

DOCTOR L929
Probably yeah.

PATIENT L929
But the other than that I hadn't had any problem.  I love to eat.

DOCTOR L929
That's good.  Alright.  I see your blood pressure's good.

PATIENT L929
And I go play bridge and I go to the race track.

DOCTOR L929
That's great.

PATIENT L929
Oh yeah I enjoy.  Haven't had anything to do with sex but I have to get on and do that too.

DOCTOR L929
The last time you were here, did you get your blood drawn?

PATIENT L929
Yes I did.  I think so yes I did.  Because you wanted to know something and you concerned something wrong you would call me or something I don't know.

DOCTOR L929
Right.

PATIENT L929
Yes sir because I left from here and went right on over.

DOCTOR L929
Okay cause we wanted to check your blood sugar to check you know how your diabetes was doing.

PATIENT L929
Well it's doing good doc.  Sometime I think it's really low.

DOCTOR L929
Your blood sugar?

PATIENT L929
Yeah it's been low.

DOCTOR L929
Do you check it at home?

PATIENT L929
Yes I do.  I take that thing and I checked it the other day and I ate a lot of fruit and apple pie and it was 116, but it's been in the 60s, 70s and the 80s.

DOCTOR L929
Okay do you ever feel dizzy or like you're gonna pass out?

PATIENT L929
No.

DOCTOR L929
Okay.

PATIENT L929
I mean when I seem to wake up in the morning, don't feel too good, then it's very low.  So I drink a lot of orange juice.

DOCTOR L929
Okay.

PATIENT L929
I mostly know when it's really low but it has got down to the mid 60s.

DOCTOR L929
Okay.

PATIENT L929
Is that too low or what?

DOCTOR L929
Yeah 60 is low but if you feel like dizzy um then you, you know that's a problem.  So are you taking any medications for your diabetes?  No huh.

PATIENT L929
No they don't give me anything.

DOCTOR L929
Right.

PATIENT L929
I just kind of watch it and check it, like you said before, every other day check it you know to see what's happening.

DOCTOR L929
Yeah and so you know basically if you have these feelings of like dizziness or kind of feel like weak, you know, just take some candies or drink some juice.

PATIENT L929
Yeah when I can tell, a little piece of candy @@@ in case I need it.

DOCTOR L929
Good.

PATIENT L929
No I haven't had any @@@ with those so far.

DOCTOR L929
Okay or uh.

PATIENT L929
And as a matter of fact, I didn't bring it in today okay.

DOCTOR L929
Or you could drink some juice.

PATIENT L929
Well I drank a little orange juice.

DOCTOR L929
Yeah.

PATIENT L929
In the morning.  I didn't drink any this morning so I feel fine this morning.

DOCTOR L929
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L929
So it must be that maybe cause I ate a big slice of apple pie last night.  No when I feel pretty bad I'm gonna jump on that orange juice right quick and then take it.  Thatâ€™s early in the morning, you know when I take that sugar tabs.

DOCTOR L929
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L929
No they don't give me no pills, not in a long time for that.

DOCTOR L929
Yeah I don't think you need it.

PATIENT L929
No.

DOCTOR L929
That would probably drop your sugar even lower.

PATIENT L929
No I don't want to do that.  Ya'll been taking good care of me so I have no problems whatsoever. And I'm gonna do what you tell me to do and that's it.  How did the blood thing come out?

DOCTOR L929
From the last time you were here?

PATIENT L929
Yeah.

DOCTOR L929
Uh.

PATIENT L929
Cause you didn't call me.

DOCTOR L929
Yeah it was normal.

PATIENT L929
Okay well then I'm, that was it because I was waiting to hear from you and then I didn't get no call.  That's about it.  About the only thing I do, I sleep a lot.  I rest and I can be looking at the TV and go to sleep.

DOCTOR L929
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L929
@@@.

DOCTOR L929
How about at nighttime?  Do you sleep at nighttime?

PATIENT L929
Oh yeah I sleep and then I have to go to the bathroom.  Let's see when I go, if I go at 9 o'clock, it's about 1 o'clock and then by the next morning.

DOCTOR L929
Okay.  Uh that's not too bad.  I mean you know.

PATIENT L929
It may be because I drink a lot of water.

DOCTOR L929
Yeah.

PATIENT L929
Because I know when I'm traveling on the streets I don't drink much water but at night when I get home I start drinking a lot of water.

DOCTOR L929
Yeah, that'll do it.

PATIENT L929
Does that do it?

DOCTOR L929
Yeah.  Try not to drink or eat anything like two hours before you go to sleep, before you lay down.

PATIENT L929
Okay.

DOCTOR L929
And then uh that way you know in two hours, if you drink a lot of water you'll urinate most of it out.

PATIENT L929
Okay.  I try to drink a quart a day.

DOCTOR L929
Yeah so you won't have to get up.

PATIENT L929

PATIENT L929
A little short of breath, now that's the only thing I could see.

DOCTOR L929
Okay when does that happen?

PATIENT L929
I mean when I do a lot of walking.  Now see I have to walk a block and three quarters of a block going to the bus stop to go to the food store so I have to stop and rest one time.

DOCTOR L929
