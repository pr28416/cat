PATIENT M834
Well they're giving me the water pill and I guess I'm starting to build water up.  It don't seem like I'm producing.

DOCTOR M834

PATIENT M834
More fluid than before.

DOCTOR M834

PATIENT M834
So what I'm gonna tell you, it's a white coat effect.

DOCTOR M834
I don't know what has it been running at home?

PATIENT M834
Uh I know it was in the 30 and maybe 20 or 23 even.  I check it two or three times sometimes you know cause I.

DOCTOR M834
So it's running between the 120s, 130s?

PATIENT M834
No, no, no.  I should've brought the book with me, I keep a record of it but.

DOCTOR M834
Okay yeah it's a little elevated here.  You're on a very small dose of the water pill so it might not be doing that much.

PATIENT M834
Oh there's one other thing the ear, I don't know if you know uh skin will peel when you get sunburned.

DOCTOR M834
Yeah, does your ears @@@?

PATIENT M834
In this one only, I can scrape a lot of the dead skin out.  I don't know what's eating in there.

DOCTOR M834
It's dry, probably due to the weather, it's really dry.

PATIENT M834
No but then why ain't the other one?

DOCTOR M834
Sometimes one will be more affected, I'll look at it.

PATIENT M834
But it's all year long it seems like, both summer, winter, spring, fall.

DOCTOR M834
Really, okay.  Well I mean if it's a skin problem we could always you know have Derm see you and see if they recommend any topical treatments.

PATIENT M834
Uh they gave me some kind of a cream for the darn finger.

DOCTOR M834
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M834
And the detail sheet says don't put it on the fingernail so I don't know where I was supposed to be putting it.

DOCTOR M834
Hmm.

PATIENT M834
I broke the finger, ran into a door, a guy opened his car door and I biked right into it.

DOCTOR M834
Has this peeling of your ear, is it affecting your hearing or no?

PATIENT M834
No, no, it's just a bit of an itch, you know a bit of a nuisance.  

DOCTOR M834
Okay.  Other than that, any chest pain, any shortness of breath?

PATIENT M834
No.

DOCTOR M834
Any @@@ issues?

PATIENT M834
But I do get the pain in the right ear from time to time because I think there's a fluid build-up in there and I was reluctant to have them drain it.

DOCTOR M834
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M834
Maybe I should get it pinched and drained.

DOCTOR M834
And so it's just the hydrochlorothiazide they started back in October so you've been on it for a few months now is that right?

PATIENT M834
Yes.

DOCTOR M834
Okay.

PATIENT M834
They can do blood tests so I didn't eat this morning, I only had tea.

DOCTOR M834
And so the liver, you saw, have you seen the liver doctors?

PATIENT M834
Well they said there's not enough blood vessels in there and.

DOCTOR M834

PATIENT M834
'98 and then after that I don't know how many years within a year or what they gave me the BCG treatment.

DOCTOR M834
Uh-huh.  Okay.  Have you followed up with them at all recently?

PATIENT M834
They just uh interviewed me what was it on December 26th, 27th, they didn't take any urine specimens or anything else, he just primarily interview.

DOCTOR M834

DOCTOR M834

PATIENT M834
I don't know I didn't get the pills yet, they might have mailed them.

DOCTOR M834
Okay, sure.  And you’re taking your cholesterol medication, right?

PATIENT M834
Yes.

DOCTOR M834
Your cholesterol looks better.  They checked it in July and it was much better than the one before uh it looks like you got an echo when you were @@@ go over the results of that.

PATIENT M834
Right.

DOCTOR M834
Let me pull it up.  You're due for your TDAP and your Pneumovax vaccines also.

PATIENT M834
No I don't want any of them.

DOCTOR M834
You don't want any of them.  We have to at least ask, that's fine.

PATIENT M834
Yeah no.  I didn't get the polio shots.  I didn't get the flu shots.

DOCTOR M834
No.  Okay, @@@ that.

PATIENT M834
Hope nature will fight it off, whatever.

DOCTOR M834
Yeah.  Alright it shows that your heart is pumping properly um.  You have mild to moderate aortic regurg so @@@ watching that, you’re asymptomatic, so that's good.

PATIENT M834
I might have been born that way, although there might be some stenosis I guess they said.

DOCTOR M834
Um no stenosis of the aortic valve, they said there might be sclerosis but that's not worrisome; it's just that the regurg that's worrisome that's what we want to follow.  

PATIENT M834
Makes a lot of noise, I can tell you that when it's on the echocardiogram.

DOCTOR M834
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT M834
Slurping around in there.

DOCTOR M834
Uh oh.  Let's see, do you still smoke?

PATIENT M834
No I gave that up maybe 50 years ago or more.

DOCTOR M834
@@@.  Why don't you go ahead and I'll have you sit up there and I'll listen to your lungs.

PATIENT M834
Do you need the shirt off or anything?  Is DOCTOR your supervisor?

DOCTOR M834
Yes.  You haven't seen her for a while right?

PATIENT M834
Yeah.

DOCTOR M834
Is this the ear?

PATIENT M834
Nope, the left one.  This one don't seem to be getting dead skin so something's in there eaten me.

DOCTOR M834
And it itches, huh, do you take anything?

PATIENT M834
Yeah.

DOCTOR M834
For the itching?

PATIENT M834
Nope nothing.  Oh I do put in a little peroxide, hopefully if there's anything alive in there it might kill be you know surface bacteria but it don't seem to be really and on the shampoo, I will put the shampoo in there too, that pink stuff they gave me.

DOCTOR M834
Uh-huh.  So, it looks a little red and irritated um, there's a little bit of scaliness.  It's not affecting your hearing right?

PATIENT M834
No.

DOCTOR M834
And it's not all the way inside right?

PATIENT M834
No.

DOCTOR M834
Just right here.  I don't really see that much.  It's a little red but that might just be some @@@.  Do you stick your finger in there and itch it?

PATIENT M834
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR M834
Yeah.

PATIENT M834
Scrape it out.

DOCTOR M834
We could give you something for the itching.  I don't think it's anything too concerning.  I don't even see a rash.

PATIENT M834
Like I said it keeps producing the dead skin.

DOCTOR M834
Yeah.

PATIENT M834
And I don't get it in the right ear at all.

DOCTOR M834
Hmm.

PATIENT M834
So I don't know why – I can tell you.

DOCTOR M834
Okay.  Deep breath, again.  Let me take a look at your ankle.  I don't appreciate any swelling.  Does it hurt when you bend it?

PATIENT M834
No.  As I said it seems like I'm walking on mush.

DOCTOR M834
@@@.

PATIENT M834
You know like a sponge.

DOCTOR M834
On just this one?

PATIENT M834
No on both of them.

DOCTOR M834
