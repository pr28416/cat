Time of Encounter:   @@@ 

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D379
You ready? 

PATIENT D379
Yes doc.

DOCTOR D379
So how have you been?

PATIENT D379
Pardon?

DOCTOR D379
How's the hip?

PATIENT D379
Oh fine.

DOCTOR D379
Good.

PATIENT D379
It's coming along very good.

DOCTOR D379
That's good to hear.  You still doing rehab with it?

PATIENT D379
Pardon?

DOCTOR D379
You still going to Rehab?

PATIENT D379
No.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
No but my hip’s coming along fine.

DOCTOR D379
It's good to see you again.  Uh how are you feeling since the last time I saw you?

PATIENT D379
Well.

DOCTOR D379
@@@.

PATIENT D379
As far as my hip goes I feel fine.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
And that part I think is going very good.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
I can walk up the steps very easy now and uh and it's actually coming very good.  But the prostate, I don't know if those pills are doing me any good.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Uh I can go a long time; at least I can sleep all night you know.

DOCTOR D379
So it helped in that regard but not really in any other?

PATIENT D379
Well I don't think it's doing that much.  It's doing some good.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
But not a lot.  Maybe it's not giving it enough time.

DOCTOR D379
Well, you've been on it for what, a little over a month now right?

PATIENT D379
Well about a month yeah.

DOCTOR D379
It should have some effect.

PATIENT D379
Uh-huh yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Um, Flomax works a little bit quicker.  We could also start you on something called finasteride and unfortunately, when is your next follow-up with GU?

PATIENT D379
Pardon?

DOCTOR D379
Uh, I'm wondering when your next Urology follow-up is?

PATIENT D379
Oh, I don't know.

DOCTOR D379
Let me take a look uh.  So the main ingredients here are like the Flomax, which is what you have now.

PATIENT D379
That's what I have now.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah and then you're not on the finasteride right?  Proscar.

PATIENT D379
Pardon?

DOCTOR D379
Have you ever been on Proscar or finasteride?

PATIENT D379
Proscar?

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
Is that another pill?

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
Evidently not.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  Those are the two that I kind of use a lot.  After that it kind of comes down to surgical stuff as well as the urologist.

PATIENT D379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D379
Um if they can do anything to open it up.  Your PSA is still really good.

PATIENT D379
Oh good what is it?

DOCTOR D379
Less than, I mean undetectable.

PATIENT D379
Oh, oh good, good.

DOCTOR D379
So.

PATIENT D379
Now when I use a catheter.

DOCTOR D379
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D379
I don't have any trouble inserting those, you know what I mean?

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.  Is it bothering you to use the catheter?  Maybe just a little bit.

PATIENT D379
Well not now.

DOCTOR D379
I mean I know it's not the most ideal thing in the world but it.

PATIENT D379
No I, I deal with that I go along with it you know.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.  I think it's just going to come down to whether um, whether we're going to want to manage it using the catheter or whether it's going to be surgical and I think that Urology is probably going to lean toward medical.

PATIENT D379
I don't think there's anything blocking it because the catheter, I don't have any trouble putting it in there and taking it out of there.  I mean there's not something that's stopping it, you know what I mean?

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
But uh.

DOCTOR D379
@@@.

PATIENT D379
But I can go 12 hours without using the catheter.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Yeah but uh.

DOCTOR D379
So you just have a hard time just going on your own though?

PATIENT D379
Well I don't have a hard time going, I have a hard time going enough.

DOCTOR D379
Going enough.  So you're not.

PATIENT D379
I'm not, no.  I go maybe a weak stream for 10 seconds.

DOCTOR D379
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D379
And then maybe five minutes later I go back again and maybe another one for 10 or 15 seconds.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  So you going a lot?  A small amount but a lot of the times?

PATIENT D379
Well uh, I can yes.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
But it doesn't empty my bladder you know.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  How long has that been going on again?

PATIENT D379
Well I think it's been going a long time because I noticed, I've had trouble before but I didn't realize what it was.  I did realize that it wasn't, my bladder wasn't being emptied.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
When I get up I go to the washroom and I go and by the time I walk to the front door and pick up the paper and come back then I'd go again.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
But not enough evidently.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.  So how many times do you use the catheter a day?

PATIENT D379
Well maybe three times.

DOCTOR D379
Okay and if you don't use the catheter how many times do you have use the bathroom a day?

PATIENT D379
Oh I don't know maybe five times.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Do you use a catheter every day?

PATIENT D379
Yes.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Yes because I want to use it at night before I go to bed.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Because I want to sleep all night.

DOCTOR D379
Okay do you use it like, so during the day do you just use the washroom or do you use the catheter?

PATIENT D379
Well both.

DOCTOR D379
Both.

PATIENT D379
Yeah if I feel that I need to I'll use the catheter.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
But I can go 12 hours without using it.  Oh and I mentioned to you before I have to go to the skin doctor you know.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
How does that look now, my nose?  Look pretty good?

DOCTOR D379
It looks better.

PATIENT D379
Yes, you know I put salve on there, yeah I don't know what they call it.

DOCTOR D379
You still need to get a look at it.  You have an appointment uh next week.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
So but it's still probably something to look at.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.  So I don't know but I put that on right away today or not.

DOCTOR D379
Are you having any pain in the hip right now?

PATIENT D379
No.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  What medications are you taking right now at home?

PATIENT D379
Uh well I'm taking one medication for my heart.

DOCTOR D379
Do you have the list?

PATIENT D379
Let me see what did I do with this, it's not on there I don't think.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  Because you have been on hydrochlorothiazide in the past, do you know why that was?

PATIENT D379
Yeah well I took one tablet, a small yellow tablet.

DOCTOR D379
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D379
Once a day before it said to cut in half but I take the full tablet.  Let's see what is it, I don't even know if they have it on there.  

DOCTOR D379
I’m trying to see who uh.

PATIENT D379
This one I'm taking for the, I don't know if it's a diuretic, what is it?

DOCTOR D379
Well you're not on a diuretic @@@.

PATIENT D379
No.

DOCTOR D379
That's why I wanted to look at it.

PATIENT D379
But I just take that one you know in the morning.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah the, so the Rehab doc stopped your hydrochlorothiazide.  I'm not really sure why.

PATIENT D379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D379
Let's see.  But I think you should be on one.  Your blood pressures have been a little high.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.  Yeah the last one, when they take it right away it is that high.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
But it's not 80 or 90, 180 or 190 or anything like that.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah but 150s, we still want to get you lower than 150.  You're doing pretty well.

PATIENT D379
Well I can get it down much lower if I sit down at home.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  Let me recheck it.  Do you have the list with you?

PATIENT D379
Yeah but, no I can get it down to 120s.

DOCTOR D379
So are you taking, you're taking the enalapril?

PATIENT D379
Is that a little yellow tab?

DOCTOR D379
I don't know what.

PATIENT D379
A little orange tablet?

DOCTOR D379
Yeah I'm not sure what they look like, let me see if I can look it up.  Is it a twice a day pill.

PATIENT D379
No just once a day I take.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  

PATIENT D379
One tablet once a day in the morning.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  Let's see what we've got here.

PATIENT D379
The problem is now; if I get up in the morning and I take my blood pressure it's high.  It might be 160.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah we want to get you lower than that.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.  If I take it right away but if I sit there for 10 minutes, you know watching the news or reading.

DOCTOR D379
It'll come down?

PATIENT D379
It comes down, maybe 140 yeah.  I don't have any problem with that.

DOCTOR D379
@@@ low.  Let's see if we can find it on Google, what it looks like.  But you're on two blood pressure medications right now, so you should be taking both of them twice a day.

PATIENT D379
Both of them?

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
Oh, okay can you just mark that down there?

DOCTOR D379
Yeah, so yeah.  I’ll mark your blood pressure medications?

PATIENT D379
Yeah because I probably have some.

DOCTOR D379
This is supposed to be half tab twice a day.

PATIENT D379
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR D379
And this one is also the other blood pressure medication.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah I'll try that then.

DOCTOR D379
And this one is a whole tab.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Twice a day.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.  

DOCTOR D379
And I don't want to start you on another one.

PATIENT D379
Na, na.

DOCTOR D379
Well I know that's 2.5 but you have the 20.

PATIENT D379
Yeah, well uh.  I know before when I was taking the blood pressure medicines.  It got so damn low I was below 100, it was 90s, 80s, you know.

DOCTOR D379
Oh really.

PATIENT D379
Yeah remember I told you I got.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
I got sick that day.

DOCTOR D379
I do remember that, that's right.  That's why we stopped the hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT D379
Yeah so then I quit taking those.

DOCTOR D379
But you had lost some weight too right?

PATIENT D379
Well I did lose the weight, now I'm trying to get the weight back.  I'm up to about 180 now.

DOCTOR D379
Does that look familiar?

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
The enalapril okay.  That should be two pills twice a day.

PATIENT D379
Yeah okay then.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
And the uh metoprolol is the other blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT D379
Yeah okay.  Yeah I'll take those again.

DOCTOR D379
When was that that your blood pressure got really low?  I remember that now, I forgot about that.

PATIENT D379
What was that now?

DOCTOR D379
When was it that your blood pressure was low?

PATIENT D379
Oh, well I don't know, probably two months ago now or something like that.  But it really scared me.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah, I had forgot about that.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.  I mean I, going up the steps, probably about seven or eight steps at my son's place and of course I can't make it to the top.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
I know I'm going to fall you know.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
So then what I did.

DOCTOR D379
Well what may have happened was when you lose weight um.

PATIENT D379
Well I.

DOCTOR D379
Your blood pressure comes down with the weight loss.

PATIENT D379
Yeah, I'm not losing any more weight now.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
And I wasn't on the weight loss thing.  When I was losing the weight, which I tried to do to help my leg.

DOCTOR D379
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D379
Then my stomach muscles shrunk.

DOCTOR D379
Oh.

PATIENT D379
I couldn't eat much.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
Now I'm back I can eat all I want to.

DOCTOR D379
Okay good.

PATIENT D379
You know what I mean.

DOCTOR D379
Can I get you to sit over here?

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
I want to take a listen @@@.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Um but I think going back on the hydrochlorothiazide would be a good thing for now.  You have a blood pressure cuff at home right?

PATIENT D379
Yes.  Yeah it's really accurate.

DOCTOR D379
So.  We'll start you on blood pressure medication.  I'll have you checking the blood pressure at home though because if it starts to drop again call in and we'll stop the, stop one of the medications okay.

PATIENT D379
Yeah, okay.   What'd you want my arm or what?

DOCTOR D379
Oh you can stay there.

PATIENT D379
I can stay here.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.  I just want to take a listen to you.  No this is good.  That doesn't do much good.

PATIENT D379
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR D379
Sometimes.

PATIENT D379
Well that's not much, not that.  It's not much help at all.  @@@.

DOCTOR D379
Can you take your glasses off for me?

PATIENT D379
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Can you open your mouth; stick your tongue out okay.  It looks better.

PATIENT D379
Oh good.

DOCTOR D379
But you should probably see your dermatologist @@@.

PATIENT D379
Well I'm putting those two things on there a couple times a day.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  Any pain here?

PATIENT D379
No, no I don't have any pain.

DOCTOR D379
@@@ for me.

PATIENT D379
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Take a couple of deep breaths.  You can breathe normal.

PATIENT D379
Everything seem okay?

DOCTOR D379
What's that?

PATIENT D379
Everything okay?

DOCTOR D379
Yep.  It was your left hip, right, that they did the surgery on?

PATIENT D379
No the right the right.

DOCTOR D379
The right, that's right.

PATIENT D379
Yeah right here.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.  Does it hurt when I press here?

PATIENT D379
No.  No.  It doesn't hurt at all.

DOCTOR D379
Okay good.  I'm glad that it's doing so well.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
And it is coming along very good.  I have a little gadget to put my sock on.  I can't reach my right foot to put my sock on.

DOCTOR D379
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT D379
Oh ever since I had the surgery yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah it may come back in time as you get used to you know.

PATIENT D379
Well.

DOCTOR D379
Work out more.

PATIENT D379
Today I was able to put my sock on the right foot.

DOCTOR D379
Good.

PATIENT D379
Not easy but I made it.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.

PATIENT D379
So it's coming along.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah I think as you work with the hip more it'll get more loose.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Um.

PATIENT D379
As I do more.

DOCTOR D379
Exactly.

PATIENT D379
But the problem I got, like I want to exercise, the exercise I want to do I can't do.  I can't get up you know and if I want to do a push-up I can't get up off the floor.

DOCTOR D379
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT D379
Oh well since I've had the operation.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Yeah I just can't do it.

DOCTOR D379
Um.

PATIENT D379
See I do a lot of things myself.  I wash the car; I change the oil in the car.

DOCTOR D379
Now the push-ups, you were able to do push-ups before?

PATIENT D379
Yes.

DOCTOR D379
The surgery.

PATIENT D379
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR D379
So now do you just feel too weak or is there pain?

PATIENT D379
Well I can't get up off the floor.  If I get down on the floor then I can't get up.  I have to drag myself somewhere like to.

DOCTOR D379
How come you can't get up?  @@@.

PATIENT D379
My leg isn't strong enough.

DOCTOR D379
Oh okay.

PATIENT D379
My legs aren't strong enough to get me up.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah I think it might take a while.

PATIENT D379
Yes but they're coming along.

DOCTOR D379
Exactly.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Um.

PATIENT D379
Yeah they're coming along.

DOCTOR D379
You're 85 years old um.

PATIENT D379
Yeah so every day is a good day.

DOCTOR D379
Well I don't mean it that way but you know those kinds of things, you know muscle mass might take a little longer to come back than for a 20-year-old.

PATIENT D379
Yeah, yeah but my leg is getting stronger.  My arms are getting stronger.

DOCTOR D379
So don't get frustrated.  It'll keep back if you keep working with it.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
So I don't have too much trouble.

DOCTOR D379
Um.  I'll be right back with you okay.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379

DOCTOR D379
Alright.  So you need to tell Matt that I said hi.

PATIENT D379

DOCTOR D379
I haven't seen Matt in a long time so.  It's because I'm here all the time, I don't see anyone anymore.

PATIENT D379

DOCTOR D379
Um so a couple things, like I said I want to restart that one blood pressure medication.

PATIENT D379

DOCTOR D379
But I want you to check your blood pressure at home um, at least for the next month or so to make sure that you're not falling too low.

PATIENT D379

DOCTOR D379
And if you notice you're getting dizzy or lightheaded.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  I'll put in refills for everything today too.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
So this new one is just going to be once a day.

PATIENT D379
Pardon?

DOCTOR D379
This new one's going to be just once a day.  You were already on it before we stopped it because of your low blood pressure in the past.

PATIENT D379
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR D379

PATIENT D379
Once a day.

PATIENT D379
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR D379
This is for blood pressure.

PATIENT D379

DOCTOR D379
The other one I want to try you on today is uh something called finasteride.  You said you haven't ever been on that before.

PATIENT D379
No.

DOCTOR D379
Okay the other name is Proscar.

PATIENT D379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D379
Now this is another prostate medication.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
It can take a little while to work as well but I'd give it at least 2-4 weeks before.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
You see any difference.

PATIENT D379
Good.

DOCTOR D379
But um we'll try it today and see how you do.

PATIENT D379
Oh good.

DOCTOR D379
It may help your prostate a little bit.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Uh keep using the catheter if you need it.  If it's not bothering you, I mean @@@.

PATIENT D379
It doesn't bother me.  I have to use it because otherwise I'd be getting up every hour and a half.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah, you want to be sleeping.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
So these are the two that you're taking now for the prostate, the one we start, you're going to be on Flomax and the finasteride.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
And then um next time you're at the urologist doctor just let him know.

PATIENT D379

DOCTOR D379
Is it the 18th.

PATIENT D379
Not the urologist uh the skin doctor, the dermatologist.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah the urologist, I think they wanted to see you in.

PATIENT D379
Probably quite a while.

DOCTOR D379
In July.

PATIENT D379
Oh.

DOCTOR D379
Another two months or so.

PATIENT D379
Oh okay.  Right, yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Yeah well that's great.

DOCTOR D379
And I think that's about it.  I'm glad to hear the hip is doing better.

PATIENT D379
Yes, everything else feels fine it's just.  I'm surprised myself.

DOCTOR D379
I'm not surprised but you're doing better than I thought.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Not that, I mean usually these hip surgeries people do better but it takes a couple of months before they feel better.

PATIENT D379
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR D379
The first time I saw you, you were doing much better than you know, when I saw you in November you couldn't get out of the wheelchair.

PATIENT D379
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR D379
I'm glad.  The other thing today is, it's something new the VA's doing, it's just um uh, do you have any Advanced Directives as far as you know?

PATIENT D379
A what?

DOCTOR D379
Advanced Directives um.

PATIENT D379
What is that?

DOCTOR D379
Uh, Living Will, Power of Attorney.

PATIENT D379
Oh yeah, my daughter is.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT D379
I have everything all set.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
My daughter gets the house.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
And my son gets my money, which isn't much but it's something anyway.

DOCTOR D379
Do you mind telling us, now I want you to bring a copy of that uh, you know as far as who gets what the VA isn't really that concerned with who, we're more concerned with who is your Power of Attorney.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
Not that I'm thinking anything's going to happen to you but it's just good to have.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
If anything were to happen to you, who we need to ask what to be done, you know what medical procedures to be done.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
And if you have any wishes uh besides that, you know about medical treatment, all that kind of stuff.

PATIENT D379
No, no, well my daughter, she's @@@ next door.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
In the Intensive Care.

DOCTOR D379
Right NAME yeah.

PATIENT D379
Yeah.

DOCTOR D379
But just for legal purposes we like to have a copy on file just you know.

PATIENT D379
Well I, let's see.

DOCTOR D379
Is that your oldest daughter?

PATIENT D379
Yes.

DOCTOR D379
Okay, did your wife @@@.

PATIENT D379
The wife I had when they were born is alive, I'm not married.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  So by default it would actually go to NAME anyways, we would ask her questions.

PATIENT D379
Yeah, yeah.  I've got everything in my will, if I should die in my will I'll be cremated and all that stuff.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Yeah I don't have any problem with that.

DOCTOR D379
Yeah.  Like I said for the VA purposes, it's more like your health care stuff.  What you want done in terms of like an emergency, stuff like that.

PATIENT D379
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR D379
So if you could bring a copy in next time and we can give it to the guys up front and we can put it in the computer so if ever is an emergency we know what you want done.

PATIENT D379
Yeah, okay.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.

PATIENT D379
Yeah because I had that probably done a year or so ago.

DOCTOR D379
Good, okay.  If you bring a copy you give it to the guys up front and they can put it in your file.

PATIENT D379
Yeah I'll have to look it up.

DOCTOR D379
Okay.  Good seeing you.

PATIENT D379
Okay same here.

DOCTOR D379
