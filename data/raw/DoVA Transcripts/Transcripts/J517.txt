Date of Encounter:  @@/@@/@@ 
Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR J517 
PATIENT. 

PATIENT J517
Yes.

DOCTOR J517
Sorry about the wait.  I'm not your regular doctor.  I think you see DOCTOR.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
Normally um.

PATIENT J517
Yep.

DOCTOR J517
Is there anything in particular you want to talk about today or is this kind for you still a regular follow-up?

PATIENT J517
Uh well I yeah I uh blood pressure.  Every time I come here it is like it's up.  Today it was 150, what was it 160 something and then she checked my right arm and it was 162.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah.

PATIENT J517
So it's always high and I'm on the, what is that listinol and also omeprazole and I don't know what's going on and why my pressure is up like that.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah.

PATIENT J517
And then at night uh during the day, rather, my feet swell.

DOCTOR J517
Your what swells?

PATIENT J517
My feet, both feet swell yeah and uh of course I prop them, sometimes I prop them up at night maybe not all the time but they seem to go down overnight but I don't know if @@@, I don't know.

DOCTOR J517
Sometimes as we age our veins aren't as strong.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
So the fact that you get them during the day and you lay down at night and you bring your leg up so the veins don't have to fight against gravity.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
The blood can flow back and that's very common.

PATIENT J517
Well okay.

DOCTOR J517
When you get older.  What do you do about it not much.  There are stockings, compression stockings you can wear to help during the day if you want to.  Some people think they're very uncomfortable.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
They kind of keep your, the pressure against the veins a little bit tighter so that they can't pool the blood there.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
And it helps to move the blood back up.  That is an option if you want something like that.

PATIENT J517
Okay.  Yeah I wondered why my leg @@@ or something.  Uh I don't, you know it doesn't hurt or anything but I can feel them.  You like when I go to the washroom.

DOCTOR J517
Yes.

PATIENT J517
I can feel like I feel them swelling.

DOCTOR J517
Right.

PATIENT J517
You know and it just started um I don't know and it's just started since my pressure's been high.

DOCTOR J517
But your pressure's been high I think for quite some time.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.  For more than a year, it's been up for a couple of years now and I just retired last February uh and I drove a bus, you know drive there and then wait eight hours a day so I thought that maybe I shouldn't let my feet swell after that well I noticed after we started finding my pressure high that's when I noticed the swelling you know.

DOCTOR J517
Let me ask you a few questions so we're on the same page because it's the first time Iâ€™m seeing you.  As far as I understanding some of the major issues that you have and doctors follow, you see the Rheumatology Clinic for your arthritis correct?

PATIENT J517
Right.

DOCTOR J517
Okay and you see the GI Liver Clinic.

PATIENT J517
Yes.

DOCTOR J517
Because you have a history of Hepatitis C, is that correct?

PATIENT J517
Yeah and also like I say I cancer removed May 17th.

DOCTOR J517
This past May?

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.  They did surgery to remove cancer in my liver and also they gave me what they called a @@@, yeah I had two spots on my liver.  One they removed and then the other they did a @@@ on it, I forget what they called it where it's just something like a microwave that would kill the cancer that they think was there.  That was done on May 17th.

DOCTOR J517
Well after that you had a CT.

PATIENT J517
CT scan.

DOCTOR J517
You had a CT just recently in October.

PATIENT J517
Yeah uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
But it looks like you have another mass in your liver.  Did anybody tell you that?

PATIENT J517
No.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah.

PATIENT J517
They told me everything was okay.

DOCTOR J517
Well you saw the Liver Clinic before that.  You saw the Liver Clinic on October 1st.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
And they said they'd order a CT for you just to make sure @@@ every six months.

PATIENT J517
Right yeah.

DOCTOR J517
Uh and I don't know if they called you.

PATIENT J517
Uh yes she called me then and uh I can't recall when she called me.

DOCTOR J517
Okay so I guess their interpretation of this is @@@ they did call you.  They're saying that it looks like a, almost like a bruise what we call a hemangioma on the liver.  But the radiologist said that it's a finding highly suggestive of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma.

PATIENT J517
What does that mean?

DOCTOR J517
That means the cancer.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
What they're seeing on the CT means they're concerned of a recurrence of the cancer.  When DOCTOR called you her thought process, she talked to DOCTOR, I don't know who DOCTOR is, if that's the GI doctor, do you know DOCTOR?

PATIENT J517
DOCTOR he may be one of the GI doctors I can't remember his name.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah he'd be one of the liver doctors.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
So I think DOCTOR looked at it and thought it does not look like cancer that it looks like a pooling of blood there because of the surgery so from their standpoint I think she's trying to tell you she's not that concerned and just so you know what the official reading was you know.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR J517
So from their standpoint it's fine.  You will still need your every six month CT.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
Um those I think are your biggest issues.

PATIENT J517
Hmm.

DOCTOR J517
Biggest issues correct?

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
Uh right now I mean.

PATIENT J517
Right but on the other finding, the one that thinks that its cancer, somebody thinks that it's cancer.

DOCTOR J517
It's the same thing.  The same thing that they see the radiologist thought it looked maybe like cancer again.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
But the liver doctor looked at it and he thinks it's blood pooling there because you had the surgery.

PATIENT J517
Surgery okay.

DOCTOR J517
So that's what they think so I obviously would check with them cause they're the ones with the CTs.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
And they're the ones that are deciding on treatment for your care.  Um I don't think, you did not have any blood work today is that correct?

PATIENT J517
No, correct.

DOCTOR J517
Um you're probably due for some blood work for the next time you see DOCTOR so I'll some like your cholesterol.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Your kidney disease.  Your blood pressure issue um do you ever get any chest pain?

PATIENT J517
No.  I have a pacemaker and uh sometimes I feel my heart beating and pulsating faster.

DOCTOR J517
Okay.

PATIENT J517
You know and I'm due for a pacemaker check and this one is on the 24th, the 24th of November this month cause they rescheduled it.  

DOCTOR J517
Okay my thought is that um you don't have an echo of your heart, that's the ultrasound of the heart for many years.  The last one was in 2000.  

PATIENT J517
Right.

DOCTOR J517
12 years ago.  Uh as we age the heart can get weaker and I know you have a pacemaker and that's good.

PATIENT J517
Right, uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
But there are times when the heart can't pump out fluid as well so it backs up and can cause our legs to swell.  Can I see your legs?

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
If that's the issue there's a different medication that may help.  It's called Lasix.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
Actually, not that bad.

PATIENT J517
Good.

DOCTOR J517
So the type of edema that you see from a weak heart is different than what you have.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
You would be able to see my fingerprints in your legs.  So I think this is purely because of your veins and you're kind of correct in saying you're a bus driver cause you drive all day and you're pushing the pedals.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
You're exercising your calves.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
You're pushing blood back up in your veins when you stop.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
So that's actually pretty common to a lot of people can @@@.  So compression stockings would help.  I can send you those.  I don't think you need anything else right now.  There's another medication, a type of water pill, it makes you urinate a lot.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
It can help with the edema but I'm not sure that you really need that.

PATIENT J517
No I don't need that.  I uh, one reason I have incontinence, what is it continence?

DOCTOR J517
Incontinence.

PATIENT J517
Incontinence.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah.

PATIENT J517
Yeah I wear Cunningham clamp and it's my you know but I have to wear this thing 24 hours you to keep me from constantly urinating but to hold it in my bladder.

DOCTOR J517
Do you think you've have time to go pick up the stockings today?  Only because they would be able to measure how much pressure of the stocking they should give you?

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
Okay.  Um and they'll let you know where and he's in Building 228.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
Have you been there?

PATIENT J517
Prosthetics?

DOCTOR J517
Yeah.

PATIENT J517
Yeah I was over there last week.

DOCTOR J517
So I'll put the order in and you just go there after this.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
Um and you can get them.  

PATIENT J517
I need something on my medication.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah let's go through them so.

PATIENT J517
And also this I haven't had for a while but I don't know if @@@ last year I think it was @@@@, but I used it on my back and I have this fungus like.

DOCTOR J517
Okay.

PATIENT J517
And uh it went away but now it's back, you know it comes back again if I use that @@@.  So you got it the list.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah we'll talk about it.  And if they mail them to you that's okay?  To mail them?

PATIENT J517
Yeah that's okay.

DOCTOR J517
Okay so first on my list that I have for you of the medications that I'm giving you, you're taking fish oil.

PATIENT J517
Yeah the fish oil I have one refill left.

DOCTOR J517
Okay I'll make sure, you keep this I have it on the computer.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Then you have the hydrocodone Tylenol that's for pain?

PATIENT J517
Uh yeah I haven't been taking that.  They gave it to me when I was released from the hospital.

DOCTOR J517
Okay.

PATIENT J517
But uh.

DOCTOR J517
So you don't even have any refills on it.

PATIENT J517
That's and that's Vicodin.  That's Vicodin isn't it?

DOCTOR J517
Uh Norco, similar to Vicodin.

PATIENT J517
Yeah no I haven't taken that.

DOCTOR J517
I think @@@.  So fish oil, that's Latanoprost eye drops are you using them?

PATIENT J517

DOCTOR J517

PATIENT J517
Uh no that's what I was taking, DOCTOR I think put me on that sulfameth, one of the doctors did.

DOCTOR J517
Oh that's been a while.  Are you still taking that?

PATIENT J517
No, no.

DOCTOR J517
Are you sure?  You not taking it recently?

PATIENT J517
No.  I haven't if anything and I don't know I mean.

DOCTOR J517
I think she wanted you to be on that because you have so many UTIs.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
And that's why.  It's kind of a preventative measure for you.  She ordered that a while ago and you still have some active refills.  You haven't gotten it in over a year so you're not taking it but.

PATIENT J517
Yeah well maybe I should be taking it then; I didn't know that's what she wanted.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah I'm tag her my notes she wanted that but I think that you're supposed to be on that and you have refills so when you don't get it mailed to you you have to call them and say that you need it.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
The Pharmacy.

PATIENT J517
Okay.  So will they mail it to me now?

DOCTOR J517
Um I can renew it and mail it but I don't know if she wants you to be on it cause you haven't gotten it in over a year.

PATIENT J517
Oh okay.

DOCTOR J517
So I'm gonna wait to see what she says.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Um, well let me renew it so you get one month's worth at least.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
If she changes her mind she can just order it.

PATIENT J517
Okay she can give me a call or something.

DOCTOR J517
Uh then you're on aspirin, full dose aspirin correct?

PATIENT J517
No I can't take aspirin anymore.  It starts my nose to bleed uh while I was taking it but I can't take it.  Calcium, calcium, I haven't had that in a while but I would like to take that calcium with the vitamin D.

DOCTOR J517
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J517
It may be able to help my, my knee just feels like a bone on bone.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah.

PATIENT J517
You know I'm listening to them.  I had a cortisone shot last week, week before that I think it was @@@ and then at home the other day I wasnâ€™t paying attention and I was bending over and my knee felt, you know it didn't feel like it but I could hear it.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah.

PATIENT J517
Like bone on top of bone.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah.  Yeah you probably do.  I think as we all age we get arthritis.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
That's probably happening.

PATIENT J517
That cartilage, there ain't no cartilage there.

DOCTOR J517
Yep, yep.  Um do you want the calcium vitamin D from here?

PATIENT J517
Yes.

DOCTOR J517

PATIENT J517
Yes right yeah.

DOCTOR J517
You're gonna need some a lot of blood work when you see DOCTOR next time okay.  So you need to go over there.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Even if nobody calls you and tells you to come over you should come in early and go to the Lab.

PATIENT J517
Okay.  Will do.

DOCTOR J517
So I think the vitamin D and the calcium we're gonna have to order separately.

PATIENT J517
Hmm.

DOCTOR J517
Um because otherwise they're not strong enough pills.

PATIENT J517
Oh okay.

DOCTOR J517

PATIENT J517

DOCTOR J517
Are you still taking a multivitamin every day?

PATIENT J517
Uh sometimes, no I don't take it every day.

DOCTOR J517
So your calcium vitamin D for sure, I mean you don't necessarily @@@.  I'm just cleaning all of your medications up.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
To get rid of whatever we can.  Okay um and I don't have any bloodwork for you today.  Let me see what it was back in October.  Okay I'm gonna have you have a seat up here so I can take a quick listen to your lungs.

Deep breath through the mouth good.  Good.  Take a listen to your heart now.  Can I have you lay back?  Can I lift your shirt?

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh sure.

DOCTOR J517
What are all these scars from?

PATIENT J517
That's the.

DOCTOR J517
You've had a lot of surgeries.

PATIENT J517
The one going across this way.

DOCTOR J517
Yeah.

PATIENT J517
That's the liver surgery I had in May.  This one was a colon reversal.

DOCTOR J517
Hmm.

PATIENT J517
Basically just my colon.

DOCTOR J517
Can you take a deep breath okay good.  Lift your ankles from the floor.  Can I see the skin on your back that you were talking about?

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
I'm not sure this is fungus.

PATIENT J517
Hmm.

DOCTOR J517
Were you told that by a skin doctor before?

PATIENT J517
Yeah that's what I was using.  I was using it on a regular basis and then.

DOCTOR J517
It got better?

PATIENT J517
Uh yeah it got better.

DOCTOR J517
Okay.

PATIENT J517
It would go away and I stopped using it and it came back.

DOCTOR J517
Okay.  We'll mail that to you.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
You can have a seat here.

PATIENT J517
Oh in the summer months it's just really, that's when it came back in the summer and uh I had it over and when I used it I had a bottle.  That bottle had some left in that one and I used it and I started getting better again then I ran out.

DOCTOR J517
You said, you had all sort of urinary; you do have episodes of urinary incontinence correct?  You urinate without getting to the bathroom first?

PATIENT J517
Oh I what'd you say now?

DOCTOR J517
You just sometimes lose your urine without getting to the bathroom first?

PATIENT J517
Yeah even though I got this clamp on uh yeah it'll come if I don't rush, if I don't get there you know otherwise I'll lose it.

DOCTOR J517
And Iâ€™m supposed to ask all patients now is in the past two months have you been living in stable housing that you own, rent or stay in as part of a household?

PATIENT J517
Well I just stay and I rent.

DOCTOR J517
Okay cool.  Um are you worried or concerned in the next two months you may not have stable housing?

PATIENT J517
No.

DOCTOR J517
Okay and then have you had any falls recently?

PATIENT J517
Uh uh.

DOCTOR J517
So there's a screening for osteoporosis, I don't think youâ€™ve had this um it's called a DEXA scan and it basically is kind of like a big x-ray of the body to see how strong your bones are.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
Um and it suggests if you're 84 that you would get that screening done, do you want that?

PATIENT J517
Yeah.  I'll get it.  At my age I just can't @@@.  I twisted my knee in 2011 @@@ birthday.  I twised and I already I have a rod inside my left femur which I guess comes down almost just above my knee and I messed up the cartilage and the arthritis seems to be worse in this knee here but anyway uh.

DOCTOR J517
Do you have a history of a hip repair?  Did you have a hip repair?

PATIENT J517
No just the uh, well I was in an automobile accident, this was in 89 in uh 1989 and I severed my artery and the muscle and broke the femur, left femur.  So he put a steel rod inside the femur but uh you know actually it doesn't bother me you know just the arthritis in the knee and then I twisted it after my birthday on my birthday in 2011 and it's gotten worse.

DOCTOR J517
Hmm.

PATIENT J517
But otherwise you know it doesn't bother me.  That's the arthritis of course that's gonna be with me, I guess @@@.

DOCTOR J517
Okay so I have to quickly go talk with my attending about all the cases.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
Uh basically we went through your medications.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
You will have a lot of blood work ordered for next time; you can follow-up with some things with DOCTOR.  She will likely call you back to let you know about that medication if you need to be on it for your UTIs, your urine infections.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
Um because I know youâ€™ve had a history of that urine infections in the past.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
Um and you'll get the scan whenever you, I think they'll try to either um schedule it for you or I think you can go down and get it today if that's okay if you have time you should walk in and get it whatever.

PATIENT J517
That's where they look at your bones?

DOCTOR J517
Yeah where they see how strong your bones are.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
Um and then you can also go to Prosthetics today and pick up the stockings right and they'll measure and see how strong of a stocking you should be using.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Um.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT J517
Throw these away right here?

DOCTOR J517
Yep.

DOCTOR OUT:  53:10  DOCTOR IN:  58:48

DOCTOR J517
Okay.  Sorry that took so long.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Alright so one thing the blood pressure issue.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
I think we have room to go up on your lisinopril.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
It's the medication that's 5 mg I think DOCTOR had increased it last time as well.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
Um you're taking one pill.  I would just increase the dose and take right now you're gonna start taking two pills starting tomorrow.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Of lisinopril.  Once you get the new bottle that pill should be stronger so you take one pill so it's gonna be 10 mg.

PATIENT J517
Oh okay.

DOCTOR J517
Okay it'll say it on the bottle.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
But overall you're gonna have twice as much of the lisinopril.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Which means that you need to come back here and get your blood pressure checked.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
Uh with the nurse and obviously all the blood work that I ordered just get it done in about a month.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
So I'm gonna say lab one month.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
Then you need to come back for a nursing check in one month and I think we'll try to do it with DOCTOR's nurse that you follow up with all of that for the next time.

PATIENT J517
See the nurse during the same day right?

DOCTOR J517
What's that?

PATIENT J517
Can they do these two on the same day?  The lab and the nurse?

DOCTOR J517
Yeah well you down to the lab get your blood drawn because it's gonna be an active order but then the nurse, the blood pressure check you have to come back to the clinic.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
@@@ see how it's doing.  Ideally your medications should be taken for about 2-4 weeks before we can see the effect.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
So you get the new bottle and now whenever you get it you know you can finish out your old pills still.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
Just take two of them.  Um and then you'll get the new bottle, you'll have to take blood work to make sure your potassium is fine cause sometimes this medication @@@.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
But you'll come back in and they'll want some blood work that day as well.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Okay so that's a lot of stuff but.

PATIENT J517
Yeah.

DOCTOR J517
I think we went through some medications and you will come back in a month because you're gonna increase your lisinopril so you're gonna come back to the hospital for blood work and check your blood pressure with the nurse.

PATIENT J517
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J517
After you leave here today go to Prosthetic and get your stockings and whenever it is convenient for you you can get the DEXA scan.

PATIENT J517
What was it?

DOCTOR J517
That's just the scan that looks for osteoporosis in the body.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Or weak bones and that can be done at any time.

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
Go to Radiology and tell them your name.

PATIENT J517
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR J517
It's totally up to you, whatever your day is looking like.  You can come later and there's no rush.

PATIENT J517
Oh okay, I'll check down there today and if I can get it @@@.

DOCTOR J517

PATIENT J517
Okay.

DOCTOR J517
@@@ in three months.  He needs a nurse visit with I think @@@ and labs in a month.  He can go to Prosthetic afterwards.  I ordered him a DEXA scan which I don't know he needs to be scheduled or if can just go up to X-ray.  They'll take good care of you right.

PATIENT J517
