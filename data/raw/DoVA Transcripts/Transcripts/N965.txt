DOCTOR N965
Okay.  Is that normal for you?

PATIENT N965
No usually um I mean I noticed it was usually running like 165.  I had two days where it went kind of high and I remember taking uh, I was taking some cough medicine before I went to bed.

DOCTOR N965
Yeah.

PATIENT N965
So I knew what one was and then the second one I had, I tried to back track and figure out what I had that day, it might have boosted it up why I might have eaten, ate late.

DOCTOR N965
What do you take for your diabetes?

PATIENT N965
I got it right here.  @@@.

DOCTOR N965
@@@ 

PATIENT N965

DOCTOR N965
I’ll see if I can find it.

PATIENT N965
It should be in the system. They've been checking me for a .

DOCTOR N965
They must have thought that you had something wrong with your heart, if I can find it.

PATIENT N965
Yeah, yeah @@@ the initial hospital I went to is MacNeal.

DOCTOR N965
Yeah.

PATIENT N965
And um I came to uh Jesse cause I had a primary physician over there.

DOCTOR N965
Okay.

PATIENT N965
And they ran me through the test because uh.

DOCTOR N965
When was the last time you had an EKG done?

PATIENT N965
Uh last week.

DOCTOR N965
Oh okay good then we don't need to do one.

PATIENT N965
No I had it done upstairs uh and um @@@.  Uh Jesse Brown kinda disappointed me.

DOCTOR N965
You didn’t like it over there?  They rebuilt the whole hospital; you've been there since it's new?

PATIENT N965
No I haven't been back over @@@.

DOCTOR N965
@@@.

PATIENT N965
I'm more closer over there.  I'm closer to this one than I am to Jesse for now so, I come here now.  I'm in the suburbs.  

DOCTOR N965
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N965
Before I was at 138 and Kedzie.

DOCTOR N965
Okay so you were downtown.

PATIENT N965
So I was closer to them.

DOCTOR N965
So you did have one in 2007.

PATIENT N965
@@@ the reason I stopped going over there and the reason I had my surgery, my prostate surgery was done at Loyola, is because I did the, they did the biopsy and they never called me up to let me know what was going on.

DOCTOR N965
So you @@@.

PATIENT N965
So all of a sudden, yeah they left me hanging and suddenly you know, I got a note that I have an appointment.  I come in and uh @@@ surgeon comes up to me and says when do you want your surgery.

DOCTOR N965
And you're like what?

PATIENT N965
I'm like you sure you have the right person?  I looked at him like he was oh like he was from Mars or something.  It took a whole month.  “Sure you got the right candidate there, doc?” So uh I went in and talked to a nurse, uh the head nurse at the time and they took me to discuss the stuff @@@ and all of a sudden they wanted me through a whole battery of tests and then uh, I @@@ two-week time frame.

DOCTOR N965
I'm reading this note from this doctor you saw DOCTOR.  Boy I'm trying to read it from 2007.

PATIENT N965
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N965
Let's see what it says about that stress test.  Your basement flooded.

DOCTOR N965
What about this medication metoprolol that expired.  There's like four medications on here that expired.  Did you need to take that one?

PATIENT N965
Is that from here?

DOCTOR N965

PATIENT N965

DOCTOR N965
Were you taking that one?

PATIENT N965

DOCTOR N965
Let me see what DOCTOR wrote in his last note.  Cause that would be the medication I'd want to get you back on.

DOCTOR N965

DOCTOR N965
Yeah I'm going to renew the metoprolol and send it to you.

PATIENT N965
Something else.  I got three that came in the mail.

DOCTOR N965
Yeah it's almost like it just fell off your medication list.  Okay I'm gonna renew that one.

PATIENT N965
Okay.

DOCTOR N965
And then I want to look at your.  And I don't see where is this…  So what are they telling you about your diabetes?

PATIENT N965
They told me it wasn't under control and I'm like, every time I came in here you're telling me @@@.  I've already had been a full day.

DOCTOR N965
Yeah.

PATIENT N965
And I says you now I, sure I've eaten since then I said but uh I always.  When I was told that I had diabetes and I was told by the nurse to take uh, to check.  All I needed to do was check it once a day.

DOCTOR N965
Yeah.

PATIENT N965
It's all this flip flopping all around and taking the readings. 

DOCTOR N965
Yeah.

PATIENT N965
So the readings were uh flip flopping so they was like well you know you're not really keeping it under control but since um they got on my case about it and my mother got on my case about it I've been doing, I do it every day.

DOCTOR N965
That's what you need to do good.  Alright do you mind if I take a quick look at you?  I think you're gonna be fine if you get the surgery.

PATIENT N965
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N965
I want to, I'm gonna make sure that you get this medication back before you start so that you can take that before the surgery but otherwise I think you're gonna be just fine.

PATIENT N965
Okay.
