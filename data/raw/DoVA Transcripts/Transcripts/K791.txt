DOCTOR K791
It's not that kind of medication.  Okay I'm sorry that they gave you a hard time about it.

PATIENT K791

DOCTOR K791
Are you able to go downstairs for some labs today?

PATIENT K791
I went downstairs today.

DOCTOR K791
To the Lab?

PATIENT K791
Oh to the Lab no.

DOCTOR K791
Okay so I'll have you stop by the Lab on your way out so you don't have to make an extra trip.

PATIENT K791
I'm not gonna make an extra trip.

DOCTOR K791
Yeah I'm saying so you don't have to make an extra trip since you've done that a lot.

PATIENT K791
Yeah.

DOCTOR K791
Are you fasting today?

PATIENT K791
No.

DOCTOR K791
You're not okay.  Um you know it helps when you come to the VA to be fasting cause usually we check your cholesterol and that way you don't have to make an extra trip while you're fasting okay.

PATIENT K791
How many @@@ cholesterol @@@.

DOCTOR K791
Less than two.

PATIENT K791
@@@.

DOCTOR K791
@@@ uh-huh.  Two to three @@@.

PATIENT K791
Alright @@@ so one of them @@@.

DOCTOR K791
We could probably do that, if you wanted to fast next time and come and then we can just check one lab today, the diabetes lab, the A1c.  You don't have to be fasting for that so we'll check that today and then the other one can be checked next time you come.

PATIENT K791
Sounds good.

DOCTOR K791
Okay.  @@@.  So the diabetes lab we'll check today okay?

PATIENT K791
Yeah that's fine.

DOCTOR K791
Okay.  

PATIENT K791
They're billing Blue Cross/Blue Shield and they're trying to collect $440 from me.

DOCTOR K791
From you?

PATIENT K791
From Blue Cross/Blue Shield.

DOCTOR K791
Oh really.

PATIENT K791
They told me to @@@.

DOCTOR K791
Huh.  Well how's everything else been?

PATIENT K791
(Laughs).

DOCTOR K791
@@@.  And then I'll order that shingles vaccine for you.

PATIENT K791
Most of the time they'll send me a letter saying you're due @@@ two weeks from now @@@.

DOCTOR K791
@@@ at the time of the next visit with DOCTOR.

PATIENT K791
Great.  @@@.  Now if I get in trouble with this medicine should I call you?  Who do I call?

DOCTOR K791
Um you know I don't know how much I'll be able to do because of the rules and their limitations.

PATIENT K791
Okay.

DOCTOR K791
So for a few days if you're running low you may have to take your glipizide just twice a day @@@ okay.  I'm sorry about that.

PATIENT K791
@@@.

DOCTOR K791
@@@ talk about?

PATIENT K791
Yeah I'm getting some trouble with my joints.

DOCTOR K791
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K791
@@@ straight.

DOCTOR K791
Is @@@ in your hands or?

PATIENT K791
In my hands.

DOCTOR K791
Just in your hands okay.  @@@ which thumb?

PATIENT K791
Mainly this one.

DOCTOR K791
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K791
And this one.

DOCTOR K791
And this one.

PATIENT K791
But uh.

DOCTOR K791
Does that hurt when I do this?

PATIENT K791
No but it's @@@.

DOCTOR K791
@@@ when I go like this, squeeze my hand, squeeze my hand okay good.  @@@ and you said they feel stiff?

PATIENT K791
Yes.

DOCTOR K791
Okay.  When do they feel stiff, when you're actually use them?

PATIENT K791
No, @@@ just if I @@@.

DOCTOR K791
Okay.

PATIENT K791
@@@.

DOCTOR K791
Have you okay, so it doesn't look like you have sort of inflammation changes, inflammatory arthritis so you probably have an osteoarthritis at this point, @@@ generations.  Um have you tried Tylenol or anything for the pain?

PATIENT K791
I tried @@@.

DOCTOR K791
Okay well, it's the anti-inflammatory medicines called ibuprofen, Aleve, Motrin those are the medicines they don't want you to take, those are bad for your stomach.  Tylenol is okay with the stomach but it's bad for the liver.  They don't want you to take large amounts of Tylenol but if you need to take an occasional Tylenol or a Tylenol once a day that's okay.  Tylenol Arthritis, if you did take one or two Tylenol that's not gonna be a big deal.  It's not going to affect your liver.

PATIENT K791
@@@.

DOCTOR K791
You don't have liver disease so.

PATIENT K791
That would help @@@.

DOCTOR K791
It'll help with the pain uh-huh and it may help to some degree with the stiffness.  The anti-inflammatories will help more of the stiffness but I don't want you to take those cause those are bad for your stomach and bad for the kidneys so Tylenol @@@ if you need it okay.  Does that sound alright to you?

PATIENT K791
That sounds good.

DOCTOR K791
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT K791
I thought maybe you had a magic pill or something.

DOCTOR K791
No, unfortunately I don't.

PATIENT K791
Okay.

DOCTOR K791
Okay so let me show you when you need to go for your shot.

PATIENT K791
Yes.  (Patient and doctor are walking someplace)

DOCTOR K791
@@@.  You can take a seat here and they'll come and get you for your shot.

PATIENT K791
Okay.  So @@@.

DOCTOR K791
Yeah.  @@@.  Take care.

PATIENT K791
