DOCTOR M032
PATIENT? 

PATIENT M032
Pardon?

DOCTOR M032
How you doing today?

PATIENT M032
Pretty good and yourself?

DOCTOR M032
I'm good.  I'm DOCTOR, I work with DOCTOR.  @@@.

PATIENT M032
Okay.

DOCTOR M032
Um so yeah.

PATIENT M032
@@@.

DOCTOR M032
Um, I was talking to DOCTOR, who I know you saw last time.

PATIENT M032
Yeah.

DOCTOR M032
Um so how you doing today?

PATIENT M032
Still have back pain.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
And the headaches.

DOCTOR M032
When do you see @@@ again?

PATIENT M032
Uh I just saw them Monday.

DOCTOR M032
Yeah.

PATIENT M032
Yeah.

DOCTOR M032
And they said that they were still waiting for the report?

PATIENT M032
I don't know.

DOCTOR M032
Is that right?  Cause I think they're the ones that have to make the decision if they want to treat your headache so what they want to do.

PATIENT M032
Okay.

DOCTOR M032
Okay um it looks like from your tests though that the EEG that they did where they stuck all those electrodes on your head.

PATIENT M032
Right.

DOCTOR M032
It looked normal.  So the findings were normal and symmetrical patterns were seen.  No evidence was seen in the sleep and waking methods or any focal or diffuse abnormalities so that's good.  At least they don't see anything wrong.

PATIENT M032
Okay.

DOCTOR M032
Um.

PATIENT M032
But she said something about a concussion, a mild concussion or something.

DOCTOR M032
Are they gonna do?  Well on the EEG Report it doesn't show any of that.  Um I don't know what she said.  If she said anything about a concussion because she didn't write anything about it and then are they gonna do like a MRI or anything like that?  Oh they did the MRI.

PATIENT M032
Well they did most of all the testing.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
I don't know about any more testings.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
The only thing that she said that it would be in a report was a mild concussion.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
I @@@.

DOCTOR M032
I think we need to have you see the neurologist again though.

PATIENT M032
Uh when?

DOCTOR M032
To see if they want to do anything about it.  Um.

PATIENT M032
Just saw them Monday.

DOCTOR M032
They basically said awaiting results of the ABER for post concussive symptoms.

PATIENT M032
Okay.

DOCTOR M032
And loss of balance.  Seen by ENT surgery who have suggested surgery treatment of migraine equivalent if the ABER  result is also normal.  And the ABER results are normal so that's, they probably recommend treating the migraine then.

PATIENT M032
Okay.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.  Um, regarding your back pain @@@ of the entire back.  Um, when was that done? October. Okay.  What are you taking for pain?

PATIENT M032
Well I'm taking the tramadol.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
And the neurologist asked me to cut back on the, cut back on the um Tylenol because they can damage my liver.

DOCTOR M032
Can hurt your liver.

PATIENT M032
Yeah they can damage my liver.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
And uh they want me to take the Tylenol just rather than four times a day, take it one time a day.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
Just to cut back you know, but what I'm saying after I cut back.

DOCTOR M032
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M032
Then what am I gonna use for the pain?

DOCTOR M032
Hmm.

PATIENT M032
I know that they increased the dosage of tramadol to 50%.

DOCTOR M032
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M032
I don't know, I know they increased one of them to 50%.

DOCTOR M032
So how often are you taking the Tylenol right now?

PATIENT M032
I was taking it four times a day.

DOCTOR M032
Is that one tablet or two tablets four times a day?

PATIENT M032
Two tablets four times a day.

DOCTOR M032
And now what are you taking?

PATIENT M032
Now I'm taking two tablets once a day.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
Because they said I've been taking the Tylenol for a long period of time.

DOCTOR M032
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M032
Which has been over a year.  Almost a year and six months.

DOCTOR M032
Okay and the tramadol how much or how often are you taking it?

PATIENT M032
The tramadol twice a day.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.  So you can take the tramadol up to four times a day.

PATIENT M032
Increase it?

DOCTOR M032
Yeah you can take it up to four times a day.  That's how it's order at least.  Do you have your bottles?

PATIENT M032
No I don't have it.

DOCTOR M032
Yeah if you read the medication bottle it says it on there too.

PATIENT M032
Okay.

DOCTOR M032
Um the Tylenol, I don't know why they would tell you to take less.  You've had liver function tests done.

PATIENT M032
Yes.

DOCTOR M032
And that was in February.

PATIENT M032
Yes.

DOCTOR M032
And they actually don't look bad so you can actually take more Tylenol than just two tablets once a day.

PATIENT M032
What are you suggesting we take?

DOCTOR M032
Um the maximum dose is taking two tablets four times a day.

PATIENT M032
So that's eight tablets a day.

DOCTOR M032
Right.

PATIENT M032
That's what I was taking.

DOCTOR M032
That was, yeah that's the maximum you can take per day.

PATIENT M032
Go back to taking them?

DOCTOR M032
Well how's your pain doing?

PATIENT M032
Well I'm still with the pain.

DOCTOR M032
Is it mostly back pain?

PATIENT M032
No both, headaches and back pain.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
So what I'm asking you is.

DOCTOR M032
Is what you should do.

PATIENT M032
Because the neurologist said cut back now you're telling me to keep taking them.

DOCTOR M032
Well I don't know.  The neurologist really didn't write too much in her note here um, why she would actually say that.

PATIENT M032
Because she said because of my liver.

DOCTOR M032
Yeah.  If you take it in high doses or more than the recommended amount yeah.

PATIENT M032
But I'm just taking what's recommended.

DOCTOR M032
I understand.

PATIENT M032
On the bottle you know.  Why would she say cut back on it and you said take more?

DOCTOR M032
I think take what's recommended on the bottle.

PATIENT M032
Okay.

DOCTOR M032
Your liver isn't bad, right?  Are you a drinker?

PATIENT M032
I don't drink.

DOCTOR M032
No, oh well, okay.  Um let's see.  So then how have your sugars been doing?

PATIENT M032
I assume it was normal, I'm not sure.

DOCTOR M032
Do you check it every day?

PATIENT M032
Yes I checked it uh once every day.

DOCTOR M032
Your sugars.

PATIENT M032
I check it in the morning and don't check it that evening, check it the following evening after the meal, two hours after meals that's what he told me now.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.  Do you have the numbers?  You have a lot of sugars in the 90s. Do you eat a lot of sugary food at night?

PATIENT M032
Um not, I'm trying to stick with it.  Sometimes I fall off you know.  I try to keep up with it.

DOCTOR M032
Actually they're not too bad.  You've got @@@ here now.

PATIENT M032
Guess that's when I fall off the wagon as they say.

DOCTOR M032
Why did you check your blood sugar at 2:08 in the morning, is the timing on these right?

PATIENT M032
I don't know.

DOCTOR M032
When was the last time you checked your blood sugar?

PATIENT M032
I checked it.

DOCTOR M032
The 135 and what time is that from?

PATIENT M032
That uh in the morning, that was last night the last one.

DOCTOR M032
This 130 happened last night?

PATIENT M032
Yeah.

DOCTOR M032
You're gonna have to, take it to the pharmacist today, have him change the time.

PATIENT M032
Okay.

DOCTOR M032
Because it says 1:12 p.m. so this looks like its yesterday after lunch.

PATIENT M032
Just take it to the Pharmacy and tell them to change the.

DOCTOR M032
Yeah, they need to change the settings.

PATIENT M032
I'm not up at 1:47 in the morning.

DOCTOR M032
That's what I, well yeah, this is at 1:12 p.m. and then this is at 2:08 a.m. which doesn't make too much sense.

PATIENT M032
No, no.  I'm not up that time of the morning.

DOCTOR M032
Uh-huh.  

PATIENT M032
Is the time incorrect, can you set it?

DOCTOR M032
I don't know how to set it.  That's why I said take it to the pharmacist, it's the first door on the right and they can actually do it for you.

PATIENT M032
Is it all the way down?

DOCTOR M032
No on this hallway.

PATIENT M032
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M032
The first door on the right, with the blond lady, short blond hair.  She's with DOCTOR @@@.

PATIENT M032
Where about over here?

DOCTOR M032
Yeah.

PATIENT M032
Straight across?

DOCTOR M032
In this hallway.  It's the first, when you're coming towards this way it's the first door on the right.

PATIENT M032
Alright.

DOCTOR M032
So when you're leaving here, it's the last door on the left.

PATIENT M032
Okay so it's just like where the uh blood test area?

DOCTOR M032
I'll take you there, don't worry about it.  

PATIENT M032
Because the only pharmacist I know of is the one all the way at the end down there.

DOCTOR M032
Hmm.  Are you taking amitriptyline at bedtime?

PATIENT M032
Yes.

DOCTOR M032
Is that helping at all?

PATIENT M032
Uh, cause I don't, because I'm not, at least I'm getting some sleep.

DOCTOR M032

DOCTOR M032

PATIENT M032
Taking all my meds, even some of the stomach.

DOCTOR M032
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT M032
No I'm trying to cut back.

DOCTOR M032
And when was the last time you had a cigarette?

PATIENT M032
Uh day before yesterday.

DOCTOR M032
How often are you smoking?

PATIENT M032
I'm trying to smoke as less as possible.

DOCTOR M032
I know but like how often, like four cigarettes a week or?

PATIENT M032
Uh something like two maybe three.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.  

PATIENT M032
I cut way back on the smoking.

DOCTOR M032
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M032
I used to smoke a pack every other day.

DOCTOR M032
Okay, so youâ€™ve been making progress, then.

PATIENT M032
This gum has helped it sometimes but sometimes you just get the craving.

DOCTOR M032
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M032
Nothing like that cigarette @@@.  So it's alright because I @@@ somebody from the Surgery Clinic that was supposed to be for March 4.

DOCTOR M032

DOCTOR M032
Okay, your sugar could be under slightly better control but you should be okay yeah.

PATIENT M032

DOCTOR M032
Yeah, it's just that we need to recheck some labs today to see how you're doing.  And uh you ate today I take it?

DOCTOR M032
We need to retest your total cholesterol again. Sit up here.  How's your dizziness?

PATIENT M032
Well I haven't fallen lately.

DOCTOR M032
You haven't.

PATIENT M032
That's a good thing.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
Wasn't like when it first started.

DOCTOR M032
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M032
Which was, I had to hold on to something; at least now my head is not spinning.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
Because it was before.  It was like my head was like spinning when I get up.

DOCTOR M032
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M032
Spinning when I go to sleep to lay down so at least that's not spinning.  So evidently the meclizine is doing some good.

DOCTOR M032
Yeah.  Deep breath.  Just breathe normally.  Swelling in your legs?

PATIENT M032
Pardon?

DOCTOR M032
Swelling in the legs?

PATIENT M032

PATIENT M032

DOCTOR M032

(DOCTOR OUT:  61:19  DOCTOR IN:  68:29)

DOCTOR M032
Okay um for the Tylenol, @@@ okay, Iâ€™m going to write on the front here that you need to follow-up with neurology @@@.

PATIENT M032
Okay.

DOCTOR M032
Um and we need to check some labs.  @@@.

PATIENT M032
Huh?

DOCTOR M032
The hemoglobin A1c which is a marker to see how your sugars have been doing, so we need to get that, the cholesterol and um @@@ level.

PATIENT M032
Okay.

DOCTOR M032
Um and then one more thing, the metformin that you're taking for diabetes, we're gonna bump it up a little bit.  Um you're on 500 mg twice a day, we're gonna go up to 850 @@@ a day.  And the metformin shouldnâ€™t cause any low blood sugars, but your sugars are still high and we need to get them lower.  Do you usually get your meds by mail or do you want to pick them up?

PATIENT M032
No I'll pick it up.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
I'd rather pick it up than for it to be sent out because then it goes to the post office and it sits there and so then I have to go.

DOCTOR M032
@@@.

PATIENT M032
See them coming last week, it was the only week I had a small week.  I had no visits last week.  That's only the weekend @@@.

DOCTOR M032
Okay.

PATIENT M032
So I have to go back to the Wellness Center, plus that helps my back also.
