Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR U776 
PATIENT?

PATIENT U776
Uh-huh.  Oh how you doing?

DOCTOR U776
Good to see you again.

PATIENT U776
Taking care.

DOCTOR U776
Try to, how about you?

PATIENT U776
Yeah, I'm still this side of the grass.  I always figure if you wake up breathing that's half the battle.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah it is.  Someone said you were in recently with some hand tremors.

PATIENT U776
Yeah I started to develop shakiness in my right hand.  In the morning, I'd try to drink a cup of coffee; if I didn't grab it with both hands I would wear it.

DOCTOR U776
Hmm.

PATIENT U776
If you know what I mean.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
And uh I came in and I saw Neurology and they checked me out and they put me on a medication, there's a new medication on there that I take in the evening.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
And they said it would probably calm the quivering and so far it's about as good as it's going to get yeah.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
You know, I mean, I can hold my left hand perfectly still but the right hand's almost perfectly still now.

DOCTOR U776
Hmm.

PATIENT U776
I just take the pill at night.  I don't know what it is, it's some kind of an anti-seizure medicine they put me on but uh I had been getting these off and on, uh I get uh sort of a shooting pain that comes up the right side of my neck.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
Into my head and it feels sort of like a firecracker going off.

DOCTOR U776
How long has that been going on?

PATIENT U776
Uh oh like three or four months and then if I just, you know shake the hell out of my head, like so, it'll go away.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
That's the only way I finally get rid of it.  It's just, bam, gone and I told them about that so they did a bunch of tests on me and checked out and they said everything seems to be right but they suggested trying this seizure medication and they said that could be possibly what was doing, with the shakiness of my right hand, the tremors.

DOCTOR U776
Did they do any imaging? CT? MRI?


PATIENT U776
Uh I don't remember.  I've got the world's worst memory.

DOCTOR U776
Where was it done here?

PATIENT U776
Here. Yeah.

DOCTOR U776
Alright.

PATIENT U776
Yeah but they were mostly physical tests and they said that everything seemed to be normal.  I had the same uh strength in both arms and you know.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
And all that sort of thing and then they said we'd try this but now I haven't had one of those since I started taking the pill.

DOCTOR U776
You're not having any headaches either?

PATIENT U776
No.

DOCTOR U776
Fevers, chills?

PATIENT U776
No I never get headaches.

DOCTOR U776
So this pain that you get up here, is it neck pain?

PATIENT U776
Yeah, it would just be like you know like my neck would go stiff and I would just feel it going up my neck and then when it gets up here it'll like go pow so, I do not get headaches.  I don't take aspirin.  Uh I'm probably odd that way but headaches for me are very, very, very rare.

DOCTOR U776
Well this pain you're getting, this neck pain.

PATIENT U776
I haven't had it since I started taking the pill they put me on.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
And it did, like I say, I'm holding my right hand almost perfectly still and they said that that, you know, it might.  They thought it would take care of the hand and it might take care of what was going on with the neck so, whatever it was I think they figured that out and the only pain I got out of the normal right now I got a pain in my right kidney but I think I got a kidney stone that's coming down.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
I'm had them before and it's the same pain, right here you know.  It hurts to lay on the right side at night and then it just lets you know it's there all the time.  It hasn't started descending yet.  Usually I get the pain there and then it works its way around and you get it up here and eventually I pass them.  Over the years I've passed a bunch of them.

DOCTOR U776
@@@.

PATIENT U776
I was told that uh my system makes too much calcium and I have to watch you know milk and dairy, anything with calcium in it because my system tends to produce a lot of calcium and I, I don't know what I did but I must a had something I shouldn't had.  You know my wife has a fit every time she sees me putting gravy on something.  I used to be able to sit down and eat like eggs and sausage and hash browns and have a couple of biscuits with gravy and of course that's cream gravy over in the morning.  I had to stop that completely because it's a cream base and uh every time you know I order meat loaf and get mash potatoes, they put brown gravy over them and she's you know what you’re going to get from that.  It's not white you know.  It's not milk.  She says there's a milk base in it, whether it's white or not.  You know so she tries, she tries to keep an eye on me and keep me from doing it.  But every once in a while I'll do something stupid.

DOCTOR U776
Hmm.

PATIENT U776
You know, I'll forget about it and order a malted milk, drink it.  So that's like sliders, White Castles.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
I love the smell of them and if I'm driving by a White Castle and I'm hungry, I'll usually stop and get me four or five sliders and every time I eat them, an hour later they @@@ right here.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
And I am just miserable for two days until they pass but then I forget about the pain and six months down the road I drive by another White Castle, I happen to be hungry and @@@.  So some of us never learn you know.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
They used to say that wisdom and patience come with age.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
I didn't get either one.  I have no patience.  Wisdom is supposed to be learning from all the mistakes you've made and I just keep making them over and over and over, you know.  I'll never learn, it's just my way.  I'm 64, if I didn't learn by now I'm not going to.  You know old dogs and new tricks.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
So and then I'm miserable until I get rid of the sliders or until, till I finally get the kidney stone through.

DOCTOR U776
So I know you were seen in the Lipid Clinic with DOCTOR.

PATIENT U776
Right.

DOCTOR U776
They were trying the uh weight loss and changing the diet cause your diabetes isn't that well controlled.

PATIENT U776
Yeah.  They talked to me about it and I've been watching my intake uh.  I've been trying to get my weight down.  When I went there I was about 260 when I saw them.

DOCTOR U776
You've lost about eight pounds since back then.

PATIENT U776
Yeah.

DOCTOR U776
So whatever you’re doing.

PATIENT U776
I don't lose a lot you know.  I lose slowly but, it comes off.  I'm at about 250 now and uh I weighed 235 when my son was born 35 years ago you know.  So I'm 15 pounds over, probably my normal weight when I was young.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
But uh I don't think I'll ever be 235 again but I'm watching the carbs.

DOCTOR U776
That's good.

PATIENT U776
So you know that is basically the thing.  If you watch the carbohydrates, everything else takes care of itself.  I don't eat anything with sugar.  I don't drink alcohol.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
Uh I drink iced tea with artificial sweetener or lemonade or diet root beer, Diet Coke, water, that kind of stuff but I haven't had any alcohol in probably five years.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
Cause they told me the alcohol would just turn to sugar in the blood stream and I’d have problems, so.  I figured why do something stupid?  I like root beer just as well as I ever liked beer.  I can get diet root beer.

DOCTOR U776
Have you ever smoked in the past?

PATIENT U776
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR U776
How much?

PATIENT U776
I used to smoke three packs of Lucky's a day for years and then I swore off the Lucky's and I uh took up smoking a pipe and cigars and the last cigar I smoked was a year ago January, last January.  So it's almost a year and a half since I've had anything to smoke.

DOCTOR U776
When did you quit cigarettes?

PATIENT U776
Cigarettes probably 15 years ago.  But I had my crutch.  I smoked a pipe, I smoked cigars.  I didn't inhale them.  I puffed on them but I still smoked them.

DOCTOR U776
And no illicit drugs I take it?

PATIENT U776
Pardon?

DOCTOR U776
No illicit drugs?

PATIENT U776
No nothing ever than what's on the sheet there.

DOCTOR U776
Gotcha.

PATIENT U776
I don't even take aspirin.

DOCTOR U776
Oh okay.

PATIENT U776
So.  I used to take a child's aspirin in the morning but I'm on atenolol and atenolol was a blood pressure deal so you know.

DOCTOR U776
But uh the atenolol lowers your blood pressure.  The aspirin stops you from having heart attacks or strokes.

PATIENT U776
Oh well.  I could start taking it.  I used to take a St. Joseph's children coated aspirin.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah, 81 mg.

PATIENT U776
In the morning, yeah the little thing they're orange.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah, right.

PATIENT U776
My wife was buying those.  I used to take one each morning.  I've got my pills broke down for morning and evening so.

DOCTOR U776
You should add the aspirin back.

PATIENT U776
Okay, I'll put that back in there.

DOCTOR U776
Any bleeding, any blood in your stool or anything?

PATIENT U776
No.

DOCTOR U776
Okay any uh reflux or anything like that?

PATIENT U776
No.  The only thing like I say is my right kidney.  I've had enough kidney stones, I know what it is.

DOCTOR U776
Is the tramadol enough for the?

PATIENT U776
Uh well, I'm in pain but no the tramadol doesn't do anything for kidney stones.

DOCTOR U776
You want to go on some Vicodin for a few days?

PATIENT U776
There used to be uh, let's see when I had my first kidney stone, what did they put me on, Thoronol.  Touronol, something like that, I don't know but I ended up in the hospital because I thought I had appendicitis.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
You know, I had had the back pain and the back pain moved and when it got down here it was excruciating and it was down in the bottom right side.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
And my wife said your appendix, your appendix is going to burst, it's your appendix.  I went to the Emergency Room and they checked me out and uh they said no you've got a kidney stone descending and they put me on something, I think it was called Toradol and it took away the pain but the pain was up here, it wasn't in my back.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
You know and I only took it for like two days.  The third day I finally passed the kidney stone.  The darn thing was as big as the fingernail on my small finger.  Yeah.

DOCTOR U776
I can’t imagine.

PATIENT U776
Oh yeah I peed blood for a couple of days after that and the funny thing was, before that came out they had given me a strainer.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
And I was peeing in the strainer and chunks of raw meat were coming out in the straining you know and these can't be kidney stones, you know.  You could see it was like raw meat.  Kidney stones are hard and I guess it was, you know what it was pushing out on its way out.  Probably opened the urethra.

DOCTOR U776
Can I ask you another question; do you still take the hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure?

PATIENT U776
Yes I do.

DOCTOR U776
Okay you take that and the @@@.

PATIENT U776
I take that every morning.  That's a water pill isn't it?  Yeah cause I'm in the bathroom all the time.

DOCTOR U776
Do you check your blood glucose at home?

PATIENT U776
Yeah.

DOCTOR U776
What does it normally run?

PATIENT U776
I fluctuate between oh maybe 115 and 140.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
I kind of go up and down like yo-yo, within that range.  Occasionally I'll pop up around 150 if I've had a piece of somebody's birthday cake or you know my wife always, no you got to have a piece, one piece won't kill you and then the next morning I run it and holy mackerel you know.  But.

DOCTOR U776
115 to 140?

PATIENT U776
Yeah 115 to 140 approximately.  I try to keep it down under that 140 mark.

DOCTOR U776
What do you take the Benadryl for @@@?

PATIENT U776
Oh that's for this.

DOCTOR U776
Psoriasis?  Oh yeah.

PATIENT U776
Yeah.

DOCTOR U776
You're back on Enbrel?

PATIENT U776
Yeah.

DOCTOR U776
Is it getting better?

PATIENT U776
It's better than it was.  Yeah my leg down here has pretty much cleared up.  The other leg here has you know cleared up except of course it leaves scars.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
But I mean I was just raw meat there when I was off the Enbrel and I was breaking out.  I had it all over my back, my arms, up my neck uh.  I was getting it from head to toe there.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
So when I went back on the Enbrel I take one shot a week and it's pretty much kept it in check.  This one big splotch up here on my right thigh is still left over from when I had the breakout.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
But I keep forgetting and I keep scratching the damn thing here, which is what I'm doing now, through my pants and that's why it won't go away cause I'm irritating it.  I know, you know, if I'll leave it alone it'll go away but I don't think about it.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
You know all of a sudden something itches and you scratch it.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
It's like a mosquito bite to me, you know.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
All of a sudden, hey wait a minute, you know and then you realize when you're scratching it that you now see blood running down your arm cause you've just torn it open.

DOCTOR U776
Have you ever seen uh a kidney specialist, a renal doctor?

PATIENT U776
Uh not that I know of.  You know they have monitored my uh different levels including part of the uh blood tests for the kidneys to be sure that uh that my renal functions were normal and they said I was a little high but it had come down and it was within reason.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
So you know it's and my kidneys work, it's just uh.  Oh I've got good kidneys believe me.  I'm like the race horse; you know I'm in and out of the bathroom all the time.

DOCTOR U776
When was your last eye appointment?

PATIENT U776
Eye exam?

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
About a year ago I think.  I'm not good with dates.

DOCTOR U776
You had your retinal screening for diabetic retinopathy.

PATIENT U776
Right.

DOCTOR U776
In 2008.

PATIENT U776
Okay that was the last one I had.  And uh I had new glasses because my eyes got a little worse than they were the previous time.  I wear bifocals.  Not a lot different, just a little.  Yeah I got to see that where they showed me the screen with the pictures of the back of my eyeball.  

DOCTOR U776
Oh.

PATIENT U776
I was in pretty good shape.  Nothing was eaten away.  That's what they try to watch for.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
I guess, its degeneration.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah exactly.

PATIENT U776
And mine are still where they belong.  Nothing's falling off.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
Or falling apart.

DOCTOR U776
Why don't you come over here?

PATIENT U776
Sure.

DOCTOR U776
I'll listen to your heart and lungs.

PATIENT U776
Do you want me to take my shirt off or?

DOCTOR U776
Uh @@@.

PATIENT U776
I got a t-shirt too.  My generation we all wore t-shirts.

DOCTOR U776
Oh yeah.

PATIENT U776
Yeah.

DOCTOR U776
Even on hot days?

PATIENT U776
Well on hot days we just wore t-shirts.

DOCTOR U776
@@@.

PATIENT U776
You know you're working around the house, working on the car or cleaning out the garage or out in the yard playing with the kids.  Now I'm out in the yard playing with the grandkids.  I've got an 8-year-old granddaughter whose sole purpose in life is to run me into the ground.  But I try to keep up with her.  I've still got the psoriasis on my back.

DOCTOR U776
Right here on your back, back here.

PATIENT U776
Yeah.  You know once you get it, it never goes away.

DOCTOR U776
A couple of deep breaths.  Okay.  You can breathe normally, I’m just going to listen to your heart.

PATIENT U776
Still pumping.

DOCTOR U776
Still pumping away.  Any swelling in your legs at all?

PATIENT U776
No not really.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
That's the one thing that the Enbrel stops because my knees and my ankles get like footballs, wow.  It's all liquid and has to be drained with hypos.

DOCTOR U776
You look at your feet regularly?

PATIENT U776
Oh yeah.  Yeah I'm fanatical about that.

DOCTOR U776
Okay, the ankle looks okay.  I want to see what your blood pressure was.

PATIENT U776
It was a little high but I drove in traffic.

DOCTOR U776
Oh okay.  @@@ check that @@@.

PATIENT U776
When you're retired and you don't drive in traffic, trying to get @@@ to here it's like four o’clock in the afternoon and the world was out for lunch.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
A lot of aggravation.  I mean I'm in the right lane, I'm doing the speed limit, I just don't go over it and everybody seems to think they need to drive up my tail pipe.

DOCTOR U776
127 over @@@.

PATIENT U776
Now I'm good, from what it was cause I think it was like a 160.

DOCTOR U776
Oh wow.

PATIENT U776
On the high end.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
On the top number.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
And usually my blood pressure is pretty low.  I check it at the Jewel-Osco.  They got a machine but of course how accurate those are I don't know.  They tell you not to you know.  Take it as a clinical reading, see your doctor.  Yeah if you can give me a few of whatever to just knock this out of my kidney I'd appreciate it.

DOCTOR U776
Sure absolutely.  

PATIENT U776
I don't take anything other than what's on my list there.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
That's exactly what I take and as soon as they take me off one, I pitch whatever I've got.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
So.

DOCTOR U776
Let me talk to uh.

PATIENT U776
I'm always afraid of an interaction.

DOCTOR U776
Oh okay.  We’ll get  you sorted out.  Never take anything you don't have to take.

PATIENT U776
Well, it's like I say I know what it is.  

DOCTOR U776
Yes.

PATIENT U776
It's right here and when I oh, when I bend that way it lets me know it's there too.  But when I lay on my side, on my right side.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
There's no way I can lay that it doesn't hurt.  I have to roll over and lay on the left side and I'm a right side sleeper.

DOCTOR U776
Right.

PATIENT U776
That's where it aggravates me at night cause I keep forgetting and rolling back over and it's like oh.  My wife says what are you doing?

DOCTOR U776
Just hold your hands up like that.

PATIENT U776
43 years of marriage.  Oh towards me?

DOCTOR U776
Push yeah.

PATIENT U776
Oh push.

DOCTOR U776
There you go.  Hold your arms up like this, just keep them up.  Does that hurt at all?

PATIENT U776
No.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.  Can you kick your legs out towards me, back towards you, good, okay.  Um can you squeeze my hands @@@.

PATIENT U776
Sure.  Hard.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah as hard as you can, good, okay.  Did they feel about the same?

PATIENT U776
Yeah I'm.

DOCTOR U776
Okay hold your hands out again.

PATIENT U776
Like I say I still do get a little shake in the right but it's nowhere near what it was.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
Man I was, I would have it on the arm of the chair and hear my fingernail clipping against the chair not realizing that I was doing it.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
So it was odd, I don't know.  I just all of a sudden developed that stupid thing.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
And uh I thought it was you know maybe my sugar was low.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
And maybe that was causing it cause you know when my sugar drops I get like double vision so I know if my sugar's getting low I start to carb up.

DOCTOR U776
Your balance is okay?

PATIENT U776
Yeah.

DOCTOR U776
Any trouble walking at all?

PATIENT U776
Well I got arthritis.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
Both legs, spine, right arm, you know.

DOCTOR U776
@@@ things like that.

PATIENT U776
I can't walk any distance; my legs start to hurt really bad.

DOCTOR U776
Can you raise both of your arms overhead.

PATIENT U776
Sure.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
Yeah.

DOCTOR U776
Alright.

PATIENT U776
Just, it's psoriatica arthritis?

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
And thanks to psoriasis.  You know I never had psoriasis my whole life until the diabetes and I asked uh the diabetes specialist you know about it.  You know it's just strikes me as so odd. And he said well you may have had a recessive gene for the psoriasis and your normal function kept it in check but when you developed the diabetes it reduces your immune system and that gene can become predominant and that's what happened.

DOCTOR U776
Hmm.

PATIENT U776
And sure as hell it goes crazy when I stop the Enbrel I stopped the Enbrel for about 2 1/2 months and I was running from toe to neck.  Luckily it stopped before it got to my face.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
Cause they leave scars you know.  You can take care of them but you're going end up with scars on your face I'd rather not have.  My face isn't that great to begin with and I don't want to scare my grandkids.

DOCTOR U776
I'll be back in just a couple of minutes okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  54:15  DOCTOR IN:  68:37)

DOCTOR U776
Okie dokie.  So I just talked to DOCTOR.  Um a couple of things.  One, you know that your diabetes isn’t really a goal and so we need to add another medication.  Um.

PATIENT U776
Other than the glipizide?

DOCTOR U776
Yeah, in addition to it.

PATIENT U776
Oh, leaning the wrong way, excuse me.  I don't mean to laugh but it's easier to laugh than cry.

DOCTOR U776
Um because of your kidney disease we can't start you on metformin.

PATIENT U776
No I was on that once before and they took me off of that cause it was showing on something on the kidneys.

DOCTOR U776
And so the other, then there's um well there's three options.  The way your sugars look now um, there's a medication called Acarbose you would take with meals, it's a pill.  To be honest, it probably wouldn't get you to goal but it would improve things a little bit.  The other one is starting insulin um.

PATIENT U776
Yeah when I was in the hospital last June they had me taking the insulin shot so when I was in the ICU.

DOCTOR U776
@@@ 5 units in the morning and check your blood sugar after.  You know it sounds like you're checking your blood sugar in the morning and it sounds pretty normal.  So your fasting sugar is pretty good.  @@@ higher, that's probably why you're having these signs and so if you did 5 units of insulin in the morning it would probably be better throughout the day, when you are and then the third option is a medication called Actos which is.

PATIENT U776
Don't know what it is.

DOCTOR U776
So it’s part of the same drug class that there's a lot of medication they've been in the news a lot recently.  It's called @@@, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone are a few drugs um.

PATIENT U776
I take uh @@@.

DOCTOR U776
@@@ medication. @@@.

PATIENT U776
I did have a heart attack once.  I've been through an angioplasty.

DOCTOR U776
And so while they're still figuring it out I wouldn't start it.  There is a lot of back and forth going on.

PATIENT U776
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U776
And so that leaves us with two options, insulin or Acarbose.  

PATIENT U776
Well why don't we try the Acarbose and see if that alters it and if it doesn't alter it then I'll start on the insulin.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.  So the Acarbose.

PATIENT U776
Try the pill first and then the insulin is the last ditch alternative.  It doesn't bother me, I mean hell I inject the Enbrel in my stomach every week anyway.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
They were amazed when I was in the ICU I just had them give me the shots, come on I'll do it you know.  Oh okay you know.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.  So um.

PATIENT U776
You just get used to it.

DOCTOR U776
Can you check your glucose twice a day now, in the morning when you wake up and that any one time during the day two hours after a meal?  We need to see how it looks after a meal so.  You can do it after lunch or any time.

PATIENT U776
After dinner?

DOCTOR U776
After dinner yeah so um.

PATIENT U776
Yeah dinner is easier cause a lot of times I'm out running during the day.  I pick my granddaughter up at 3:00-3:30 from her childcare then we go to the park and basically she tries to do everything in the park which means we go from the swing to the teeter-totter you know and she jumps off and runs and I'm dragging along behind her.  But that's probably why I'm losing weight cause now the summer's here and it's hot and we can go to the park every day which we couldn't do in the winter and we couldn't do it much this spring because of the rain so.  Each night I get my exercise with her before dinner and then we go back home and have dinner with my wife.  It's a routine, she enjoys it.  I enjoy the hell out of it too.  It's like having kids again.  I always enjoyed my kids.  It just broke my heart that they had to grow up and become teenagers and then get married and move out then you lose them.  It's really hard when it’s girls you know.  My son I could face losing him, the girls were hard.  The old saying about a daughter's a daughter, what is it a son's a son till he takes a wife but a daughter's a daughter all of her life.  There's a lot of truth to that.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
Daughters, you know they keep in touch with their parents, they show up for the holidays and they call mom a lot.  We see the grandkids a lot but my son, you know once they get married they become part of their wife's family so.  You might get to see them on holidays, that's about it or if I go golfing with my son.  He's 35, he’s the baby.  He's still single.  I keep telling him, my name's going to die out you know.  Your sisters’ kids don't have my name.  He says don't worry about it dad, if it dies out I've got cousins.  I go I don't want to hear that.  

DOCTOR U776
You want to pick it up at the window or do you want us to mail it to you?

PATIENT U776
Probably mail it, it's fast.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
I always get the stuff like two days later; they're good about it here.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
And uh they're fantastic with the Enbrel.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
Every time I've called that in, sometimes it's the next day it shows up.

DOCTOR U776
Oh really.

PATIENT U776
It's in a little freezer pack; you know a little cooler with the white ice.

DOCTOR U776
Oh yeah dry ice.

PATIENT U776
Freezer pack things in them.  

DOCTOR U776
Now the Vicodin, do you want to get that here or do you want us to mail it to you?

PATIENT U776
You can mail it to me; I'll just take a couple of Toranols.  See I take a Toradol before I go to bed at night and the reason I do that is this stupid arthritis is all the way through my spine and into my neck but the worst is my lower back.  I wake up in the morning, I can't stand up straight you know and the Toranol when I take it at night, I get up in the morning and I don't have that sharp pain in my lower back.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
So I don't know if I'm becoming dependent on it but I've noticed that just taking it at night eliminates that morning walking around looking for nickels.  And like all these things, pretty soon your neck is starting to bend and your spine is starting to go this way, it won't be long you're going to be walking around looking for change.  So well maybe I'll find a lot of money, what the heck, here's the positive aspect to it.  I just don't want to be like my grandfather.  His height shortened about four inches and he was stopped over when he was in his 70s.

DOCTOR U776
And another thing, well you still have this anemia, are you taking any iron?

PATIENT U776
Oh, it is?  They put me on uh, what do they call them, iron pills.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
And I was on it for the longest time and they were horse pills and I took those things and it didn't make a difference, it just stayed the same.  Uh they did an upper GI, a lower GI; they checked everything out on me.  They thought I was bleeding internally but nobody ever found where.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
So.

DOCTOR U776
The last step @@@.

PATIENT U776
I have no idea what it is.

DOCTOR U776
Between the upper and the lower.

PATIENT U776
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U776
Um there is the @@@.

PATIENT U776
Is that the one where you drink the barium?

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
I went through that.

DOCTOR U776
You had a small bowel follow through?

PATIENT U776
Yeah, they did everything on me and uh they didn't find any leaks anywhere.  I had uh when they did the, oh what do they call that rear end special uh, I can't think of the name of that.

DOCTOR U776
@@@.

PATIENT U776
Where they feed the camera up your colon.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
Colonoscopy.  When they did that they pinched off three polyps.

DOCTOR U776
But they never did a capsule?

PATIENT U776
What's that the camera thing?

DOCTOR U776
It's a little pill you swallow.

PATIENT U776
It's got a camera in it?

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
No I never did that.

DOCTOR U776
Uh.

PATIENT U776
They did everything else under the sun and it's not like I'm not healthy.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
You know, I had this for like three years and I'm still walking around in the same shape I was three years ago it's not affecting me anyway.

DOCTOR U776
Right.

PATIENT U776
I don't know why I would be anemic.  I eat, you know I don't eat a lot of red meat but I eat pork, I eat turkey, I eat fish and chicken.  I have a small amount of red meat a week but I have to watch that because of the arteries you know.  I can't go eating steak every night.  I might have it once a week but that's about it.  So and I'm in the process of trying to work with the carbs to get the uh the diabetes back down.  That's what worked for me last time.  I thought I had to stop starches so I quit eating bread and pasta and all this stuff and then I met with the dietician, no you got it backwards you know.  You don't have to give up potatoes.  You don't have to give up bread, you don't have to give up pasta but there are pastas that have lower carbs.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
So my wife's been buying this stuff, I don't know it's only got like 15 carbs versus 51 in the normal pasta.  It's about three times the cost but she buys it cause I can eat it.  Uh drain @@@ or something like that.  It's a funny name but it tastes like normal pasta so.  Then my mom was Sicilian so I grew up on that stuff.  You know there was pasta on our table even at breakfast, lunch there was always a pasta salad out there.  Hard to cut something off you've had your whole life.

DOCTOR U776
That's true.

PATIENT U776
And I did stop drinking red wine. That would probably be something I should go back to.  But see it's a toss-up because now the wine has the alcohol but red wine is good for the heart and good for cholesterol and it could balance out, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR U776
Uh I mean red wine is good for the heart.

PATIENT U776
But it's still got alcohol in it so it messes me up on the glucose.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
I gave it up totally, but I used to enjoy a glass of a dark red wine with pasta.

DOCTOR U776
@@@.

PATIENT U776
But once in a while my wife buys it, she still drinks it, I get to watch.  Um.

DOCTOR U776
Merlot, Cabernet?

PATIENT U776
Cabernet sauvignon that's what it is and she likes merlot too.  My son, every time he comes out to visit us, he lives in Chicago and he comes out to visit Carol Stream and he always brings his mom a bottle of wine.  He always shows up at dinner time then I get to watch the two of them.  I get ice water, lemonade but, she says it's my own fault.  I did too much craziness when I was young, that's why I ended up diabetic.  I will admit I used to have a sweet tooth the size of Texas.  I'd buy a dozen donuts on my way to my office, eat six in the car on the way there then get in the car and eat the other six on the way home before I had dinner when I got home.  My weight really shot up but I never met a donut I didn't like.  She always said the heart attack was a mixed blessing to make me lose weight.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
Make me change my ways so.  It's been 14 years now.  I was 50.  So I must be doing something right, I'm still here 14 years later.  Weighing less and in better shape I was than when I had it and I was only 50.  

DOCTOR U776
Okay I got everything in there for you.  Um some labs, uh we're going to get @@@.

PATIENT U776
If I went down there now could they get me now?

DOCTOR U776
Yeah. Probably yeah.

PATIENT U776
What is it just blood tests?

DOCTOR U776
Yep but when they do this @@@.

PATIENT U776
@@@.

DOCTOR U776
That's what you do when you swallow a pill and it's just a little battery-operated camera that takes pictures.  @@@.

PATIENT U776
As it goes through you.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.  It's pretty easy. 

PATIENT U776
No I never took that.

DOCTOR U776
So basically.

PATIENT U776
But I did do the barium, milkshake or whatever it was and.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
Uh they did the upper GI and the lower GI and like I say everything just checked out okay.

DOCTOR U776
Good.  So.

PATIENT U776
No news was good news.  I'll go down to the Lab now and uh take a number and they can tap me and do whatever they got to do.

DOCTOR U776
So glucose two hours after a meal and starting that new medicine and the Acarbose you'll get in the mail.

PATIENT U776
Okay and then when I get that take it before each meal or one meal a day.

DOCTOR U776
No before each meal.

PATIENT U776
Oh three times a day.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah it'll it binds with sugar and so it may give you some looser stool.  If it really bothers you and you don't think you're doing well then we'll switch to insulin.

PATIENT U776
Well the heat bothers me and everything turns to liquid in me.  That's just from the heat.  I can't help that, it's the way it affects me.

DOCTOR U776
Yeah.

PATIENT U776
You know I, everything turns to water but I do drink a lot of water.

DOCTOR U776
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U776
Every day I probably average one or two Diet Cokes a day, three to four bottles of water a day, a cup of coffee in the morning, that's a lot of liquids so you know the liquids, got to go through and sometimes it comes through the wrong end so.  But I do drink a lot more water when it's hot out than I do when it's cold.  And if anything comes up weird on the blood just give me a call, they've got my cell number on there, just call and let me know what it is or if you need me to come back in for something else.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
Then like I say, they always call me up or send me a letter and ask me to call them just to make an appointment.  If it's something that I need to come in earlier, if they should find something, fine just let me know I'll be in.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.  Thank you.

PATIENT U776
I'm retired, the only thing I've got to do is get my granddaughter to the childcare in the morning and get her at 3 in the afternoon.

DOCTOR U776
Okay.

PATIENT U776
Which is going to be a little tight but usually they're pretty good down there in the afternoon with drawing blood.

DOCTOR U776
So uh you can take this to the check out.

PATIENT U776
Check out okay.  I thank you for your time.

DOCTOR U776
Have a good day.

PATIENT U776
You too, take care now.

DOCTOR U776
You too.
