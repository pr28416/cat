PATIENT G056
Uh uh.  Only one I saw today was the lady gave me this for a survey.

DOCTOR G056
Oh really.  Okay yeah.  Cause you know sometimes when you go to and somebody orders labs on you it makes the labs that we ordered last time go away so we can get them on the way out and maybe I can just give you a phone call.  Is that okay?

DOCTOR G056
In the morning.  Okay is that the Glargine?  Do you remember what it's called?

PATIENT G056
Glargine.

DOCTOR G056
The Glargine okay.  Okay and then we have you on lisinopril.  Aside from the aspirin, the lisinopril and the insulin are you taking any other medications?

PATIENT G056

DOCTOR G056
Let me see what they gave you.

PATIENT G056

DOCTOR G056
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's just to kind of keep it clean so you don't get an ulcer there.

PATIENT G056
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G056
So have you been taking your sugars at home?

PATIENT G056
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G056
What have they been running?

PATIENT G056
Oh it has been 130s, 140s.

DOCTOR G056
Okay well that's pretty good, that's pretty good.  80 to 120 is perfect right when you wake up in the morning.

PATIENT G056
You know you can't get the perfect score.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
Someday I'll feel like eating just a little bit and some days I gorge myself.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah that's true, that's true.  So who's following your prostate cancer?

PATIENT G056
What you mean um?

DOCTOR G056
Is anybody following your prostate cancer?

PATIENT G056
Yeah.

DOCTOR G056

Good, good, good, good.  Um any trouble with back pain?

PATIENT G056
No.

DOCTOR G056
Any bone pain?

PATIENT G056
No.

DOCTOR G056
Any trouble holding your bladder?

PATIENT G056

DOCTOR G056
No okay.  Any trouble with dribbling or hesitancy?  

PATIENT G056
No.

DOCTOR G056
Anything like that or burning pain?

PATIENT G056
No.  It will really be on the mild side if I'm not near the toilet.

DOCTOR G056
Okay.

PATIENT G056
@@@ run upstairs.

DOCTOR G056
Um alright.  How many times a night are you going to the bathroom?  Do get woken from sleep quite a bit or?  

PATIENT G056
About two or three.

DOCTOR G056
Okay that's not awful.

PATIENT G056
No.  I think it depends on how much water I drink.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah, yeah.  Um.

PATIENT G056
I try to have water to drink.  I never have been.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
I'm trying to drink more water but then uh then I drink a lot of water and you’re out.

DOCTOR G056
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G056
And you have the urge to urinate there's no place to urinate.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah that's true.  Usually uh you know you're supposed to drink a few 8 oz glasses, sometimes people say a few 12 oz glasses.  Drink when you're thirsty you know.  That's the most important thing.  

PATIENT G056
Well they recommend six to eight glasses per day.

DOCTOR G056
Right.  Yeah.

PATIENT G056
I can't drink that much water.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
I've never been able to drink that much water.  It's I don't have the urge for it.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah, well that's okay.  Any chest pain or shortness of breath?

PATIENT G056
No.

DOCTOR G056
Okay.  Any trouble swallowing, pain on swallowing?

PATIENT G056
No.

DOCTOR G056
Okay any um nausea, vomiting?

PATIENT G056
No.

DOCTOR G056
Diarrhea.  Are you moving your bowels okay?

PATIENT G056
They move okay.

DOCTOR G056
Blood in the stool or dark tarry stools?  Any dark tar in your stools or any gross blood in your stool when you go to the bathroom?

PATIENT G056
No.

DOCTOR G056
Okay.  So have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT G056
A what?

DOCTOR G056
A colonoscopy.  I think you had one earlier you told me you had one at Stroger last time right?

PATIENT G056
I had one a couple of years ago at the County when I was going over there.

DOCTOR G056
At the County okay.

PATIENT G056
Very unpleasant procedure.

DOCTOR G056
Oh was it, I'm sorry to hear that.  Usually they dope you up pretty good.  Usually the worst part is getting cleared.  You know the stuff you drink the night before.  So most my experience is now I hear they'll give you something that's kind of like.

PATIENT G056
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G056
You call it like you know its Versed; it's kind of like a medication that can make you not remember, so it can be people just don't know if it's unpleasant, which is good.  You're up-to-date it looks like so that'll probably be the last one you have unless you start really having problems.

PATIENT G056
Oh.

DOCTOR G056
Okay.  Um other than that um what we'll do is we'll look at your A1c, which is a good index for the diabetes and it tells us how much sugar is sticking to those red blood cells and that tells me what your sugars have been like.  Cause you can check it once a day you know but that doesn't tell me what it's like every other time during the day.  Do you typically check it in the morning?

PATIENT G056
Yeah.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah okay.  Um did somebody stop the other insulin?  Did they tell you not to take insulin with meals at some point or did you just stop taking the insulin with meals?  Do you remember?

PATIENT G056
I don't know what one thing I had when they test my blood, test my fingers.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
After a while it's so sore.

DOCTOR G056
Okay.

PATIENT G056
I tried to test my forearm but I can't seem to do it.

DOCTOR G056
Because the little capillaries in your fingers, look at how red my fingers are and how quick they blanch and you know but the blood flow there is very good so you can, with a real teeny, tiny stick get a lot of superficial blood vessels so your bleeding would be from there.  That's why we tell you to test your fingers.  If you've been on this regimen for a while I have no problem with you testing your sugars maybe like twice a week.  I want to see one daily written where you have more than one value two hour value after the biggest meal.  That's, depending on the kind of diabetes you have and your onset of diabetes, sometimes people have a hard time.

PATIENT G056
I have a question.

DOCTOR G056
@@@ and some people have a hard time.

PATIENT G056
Might be silly.

DOCTOR G056
No its okay.

PATIENT G056
Have they found any new way to take insulin besides the injections?

DOCTOR G056
Oh yeah there's billions of them.  They have insulin pens, they have insulin pumps, they have all this other stuff.  But we got to get you on a regimen that works.

PATIENT G056
Well I wouldn't need anything like a pump I don't think.

DOCTOR G056
No.

PATIENT G056
I think that's for a very severe case.

DOCTOR G056
You're right, you're right.  You're barely on any treatment to be honest so I think that shots are probably the best way to go for you at this point, you know.  Now did you ever take metformin?

PATIENT G056
Yes.

DOCTOR G056
Did you ever have any trouble with it?

PATIENT G056
Well after on a account that they withdrew it from the market.

DOCTOR G056
No, it's still on the market.

PATIENT G056
Well you know from the pharmaceutical.

DOCTOR G056
From the formulary then?  You mean like they didn't have it in the.

PATIENT G056
And that's been quite a while.

DOCTOR G056
Okay, let's see here.  Kidney function's okay.  Metformin's a really good drug um.

PATIENT G056
Yeah but they probably have side effects, that's not good.

DOCTOR G056
I haven't seen any side effects with that one.  If you look on the internet it'll really freak you out.  You know there's side effects for everything there um but in reality what we see.  Well let's just stay the course now with this insulin.  Let me see what your A1c is today and um kidney function is today.  We'll take a little blood and ask you to pee in the cup on your way out and then we'll make sure.

PATIENT G056
Okay but what does the metformin do?  You take insulin and you take metformin also?

DOCTOR G056
You can take those together yeah.  So what insulin does is it replaces what your body doesn't have.  That's the problem with diabetes you're just not making enough insulin.

PATIENT G056
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G056
What the metformin does is it makes the tissues that sugar and insulin go to more responsive to them.  So the problem with type 2 diabetes is you know you have your whole life to high levels of sugar relatively so your tissues, meaning your muscles, your liver, all the places that store calories for energy, store sugar energy kind of stop listening you know.  Sugar would be around and it just wouldn't pay attention to it because it’s so used to it.  So what metformin does is it helps make those tissues more aware of the sugar there so you can put it away.  So insulin makes you gain weight.  Most of the things we treat diabetes with makes you gain weight and that's part of the problem is it can make you gain weight.

PATIENT G056
Well I tell you what; they withdrew me off of it at the County.

DOCTOR G056
I don't know, I don't know.  Sometimes if your kidney function gets a little high then we take people off of it but yours isn't terrible so um.  You know let's see, before we make any changes let's see what your labs look like and if we think metformin is a good idea.  Did you have any trouble with it, get diarrhea or anything?

PATIENT G056
I can't really tell.

DOCTOR G056
You can't really tell okay.  Okay.

PATIENT G056
I didn't feel no funny feeling on it.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
You know any, any feeling from it.

DOCTOR G056
Okay.

PATIENT G056
Maybe there was, I just probably didn't know it.

DOCTOR G056
Okay.

PATIENT G056
Notice it.

DOCTOR G056
Alright.  Well yeah we can see what needs to change in today when we get the lab.  Um anything else?

PATIENT G056
That's all that I need.  I have a lot of syringes.

DOCTOR G056
Okay.

PATIENT G056
About a month ago they sent me four boxes of syringes from here.

DOCTOR G056
Oh really.

PATIENT G056
I couldn't believe that.

DOCTOR G056
That's weird.

PATIENT G056
All that I needed, I got just one vial of the Glargine left.

DOCTOR G056
Okay.

PATIENT G056
And the test strips, that's all I need.

DOCTOR G056
Alright.

PATIENT G056
I've got everything else.

DOCTOR G056
You have everything else.  Do you want them sent to your house or do you want to pick them up today?

PATIENT G056
I could pick it up today.

DOCTOR G056
Okay I can do that right now.  We're gonna make sure you have enough refills.  So then see me in six months again and maybe I can give you a call next Tuesday.  We'll talk about the labs and kind of what things to tweak okay.

PATIENT G056
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G056
Do you know what things to look for if your sugar is low?  Do you know what things, what happens if your sugars get dangerously low?

PATIENT G056
I've had occasions where it got too low.

DOCTOR G056
What'd you feel like?

PATIENT G056
Oh oh bad.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
I was slated to go to Houston for a week's vacation with some friends of mine but I was sick before I left but I just ignored it and got on a plane, I felt bad and I got to Houston.

DOCTOR G056
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G056
Uh I was out of the bed.

DOCTOR G056
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G056
And I felt some medic slapping me on my face to wake me up.

DOCTOR G056
Really.  Oh man you passed out.

PATIENT G056
Yeah.

DOCTOR G056
That's even worse.

PATIENT G056
Yeah the next day I was sort disorientated.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
Almost got run over by a car I was walking to a McDonalds across the street.

DOCTOR G056
Wow.

PATIENT G056
But they took me to the hospital and I stayed there for about six or seven days.  They got the blood sugar under control plus a whopping big bill.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah I'm sure.  Um what was important is that you know what it feels like when your sugars get real low.

PATIENT G056
Oh its weak, disorientated.

DOCTOR G056
You get sweaty, disoriented, weak.

PATIENT G056
Yeah.  I couldn't seem to get nothing going.

DOCTOR G056
Nervous, @@@.  Yeah.  Sometimes people get belligerent.  You hear patients sometimes that you know cops stopping people and thinking they're drugged.

PATIENT G056
That's the only time I felt that, the hypoglycemia.

DOCTOR G056
Hypoglycemia okay.  Well it's important to recognize it you know.  Of course you're not glad you went through that but I'm glad you know what to look out for.

PATIENT G056
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G056
You know and it's only, we don't like diabetics eating candy or whatever but it's always okay to keep a little bit of sugar handy in your pocket you know just in case you start to feel like that.  We're not messing with your insulin dose or anything like that today so it shouldn't be a problem okay.  So you went to the podiatrist last week.  Are you getting your eyes checked?

PATIENT G056
Uh they never called me.  It's been quite a while.

DOCTOR G056
Let me see here.

PATIENT G056
They were supposed to have notified me, the doctor said that I hadn't been called.

DOCTOR G056
Call them then.

PATIENT G056
See I may have a touch of glaucoma.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.  Yeah.  That's okay; a lot of people have a little bit of that um.  Last time they saw you they said yeah, they saw you last July it looks like so it hasn't quite been a year.  So you can call up there and they said you're right, glaucoma suspect.  Good and then they wanted you to follow up.  So maybe give them a buzz up there um or I can ask them to make you an appointment right now on your sheet.  I don't need to write you a referral or anything cause they've seen you within a year.  You know I can, so yeah it's a good idea to go to them.  I can make it like in two weeks and you're gonna see me in six months.  Let me just take a look at you.  Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT G056
I have to call them or are they gonna call me?

DOCTOR G056
Well let's go, usually what we can do is go up to the front and and make an appointment on the way out.  You know at the front desk and then they can send you one.

PATIENT G056
Hmm.

DOCTOR G056
Okay just look right up in front at me.  Okay say ah.

PATIENT G056
Ah.

DOCTOR G056
Ah good.  Did you have a nice holiday?  Did you do anything for Memorial Day?

PATIENT G056
Do what?

DOCTOR G056
Did you do anything for Memorial Day?  Did you cook out or?

PATIENT G056
Oh I went to a little picnic like the whole day.

DOCTOR G056
Oh that's nice.  It was hot though wasn't it?  It was warm.  Good.  Alright usually with diabetics I look at your feet, but you just said you went to the podiatrist last week so I won't make you take those all those off.

PATIENT G056
I have one problem.

DOCTOR G056
What's that?

PATIENT G056
When I went to the Podiatry Clinic last week.

DOCTOR G056
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G056
They said next time I come there they gonna put a little thing on my leg to check that the circulation in my left leg.

DOCTOR G056
Right, right.

PATIENT G056
Wasn't good and I have something else I notice I get a, something like that that don't come off and I got a scab here.  Somehow it came off.

DOCTOR G056
Huh.  It comes off?

PATIENT G056
It doesn't seem to heal.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.  See it looks almost.

PATIENT G056
That's why giving me, put aloe vera on it.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
Stuff like that.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
It stays on.

DOCTOR G056
Does it itch?

PATIENT G056
No it don't.

DOCTOR G056
It doesn't itch.

PATIENT G056
I got no feeling from it.

DOCTOR G056
Doesn't hurt?  It looks like.

PATIENT G056
I've been told that if you have poor circulation.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
Uh uh things don't heal so well.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah but usually with people with poor circulation you expect to see it at the foot and not up on the calf because the arteries get smaller and smaller is the reason.  But up here, I don't think we can attribute that that far up.

PATIENT G056
I've had this for a long time.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
So.  It's no pain or anything just, it's just there.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.  Does it get bigger?

PATIENT G056
Huh?

DOCTOR G056
Does it get bigger or stay put?

PATIENT G056
It's like I don't even know how I got it.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
I can't remember getting a abrasion or anything like a cut.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.  To be completely honest with you I don't know what that is.  For a minute I thought it was eczema you know cause the way the edges are kind of and the way there's a little bit of scabbing.  Sometimes the red blood cells you can see them come on the outside and you get this like kind of speckle of eczema but the @@@ of eczema is itching and yours doesn't itch so it's probably not eczema.  Um you're dark-skinned enough so I'm not worried about cancer or anything like that you know um but there's some sort of cancer cause it is a little dark in there.  I don't know, I think DOCTOR will check it.  Um but for now you know I'm glad it doesn't hurt or it doesn't itch cause I could give you cream for it.

PATIENT G056
Okay would I go back to the Podiatry Clinic and maybe.

DOCTOR G056
You know this is more of a dermatology issue though.  This isn't really.

PATIENT G056
I'll find out why it's like that.

DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
And they say, this leg doesn't have good circulation in the right leg.

DOCTOR G056
That one does okay.  Okay.  Are you a smoker?

PATIENT G056
No.

DOCTOR G056
Okay.  Alright.  Let me take a listen to your heart here.  Uh I will call DOCTOR in to take a look cause honestly I don’t know.  Deep, good, deep breath again good.  Okay and you can just breathe normally.  Okay.  I'll be back in a second.  So I put the um Glargine and we'll get you an appointment for following up with me in six months.  I sent you the Glargine and then you said you needed the strips so we'll send those out.

PATIENT G056
Yeah.

DOCTOR G056
We'll ask you to stop by the Lab today to take a look at everything okay.  I'll be back in just a second.

PATIENT G056
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  39:12  DOCTOR IN:  43:42)

SECOND DOCTOR G056
Hello.

PATIENT G056
Oh hi doc.

SECOND DOCTOR G056
Hi. @@@.

PATIENT G056
Yeah it's right here.

SECOND DOCTOR G056
Yeah it doesn't blanch.  @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR G056
Why don't we put some @@@ you know something.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Okay.

PATIENT G056
Maybe I could take a knife and just cut it off.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Oh no.  You could try, @@@ that too.

SECOND DOCTOR G056
I understand.  

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Well we'll put some steroid cream on it.

SECOND DOCTOR G056
Yeah it doesn't look like normal @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Okay, thank you.

SECOND DOCTOR G056
No problem.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Alright so your medications are coming to your house or you're picking them up at the window.

PATIENT G056
Okay now on eye, do I call them or are they gonna call me?

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Usually, I don't know how it works.  Usually you go up there and get a number right?  Is that right?

PATIENT G056
Well I'll call them and find out if they have me listed for any kind of future appointment.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Are talking the medicine or are we talking appointments?

PATIENT G056
Talking about appointment.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Okay.

PATIENT G056
For the eyes.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
For the eye doctor, oh yeah.  For them you can go up there and say I need an appointment with the eye doctor in two weeks.

PATIENT G056
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
So right when you get out of here I would go right to the left, make that appointment, an appointment with me, I'd like to see you in six months if that's okay any sooner if needed of course but they'll send you a letter.  And then the Pharmacy's over there and you'll have your Glargine, your strips and I'm going to give you triamcinolone ointment.

PATIENT G056
Well you want me to go to give the blood.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Yeah.

PATIENT G056
And get the uh eye appointment.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Yeah, yeah it doesn't matter what order you go in, doesn't matter to me but the important thing was the triamcinolone.  I'm gonna give you the ointment, cause it's a little oilier, it's more potent.  You need very little.  Just put it on a real thin film like that twice a day.  Don't put it on your face.  Don't put it on any babies but just keep it right there on the leg cause it's a pretty potent steroid okay.  And just do it until that goes away.  Okay no you're right, you were gonna say, we'll ask you to go to the Lab.  Do those three things in any order you want.  Sounds good?

PATIENT G056
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Any questions for me?

PATIENT G056
No.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT G056
I got to find that lady.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Oh let's see the last time it looks like your cholesterol was excellent alright.  Let's put all these in before I forget okay.  Now you're not on anything for cholesterol so I'm not gonna check it cause it was good last year and we don't need to check it every six months okay.  Sounds good?

PATIENT G056
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Alright.

PATIENT G056
Okay well thank you doctor.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
You're free.  Okay thanks for seeing me and don't for that, so where are you going now?

PATIENT G056
The Pharmacy to pick up the medicine.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Okay what's the other thing you're gonna do?

PATIENT G056
You want me to get the blood draw too.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Uh-huh and then what's the third thing?  Remember?

PATIENT G056
Um.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
It's the appointment, @@@.

PATIENT G056
Okay.  Do that.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Okay, we'll see.

PATIENT G056
Hope I can find that lady for this.

FIRST DOCTOR G056
Yeah I'm sure.  You can give this thing to maybe the lady.

PATIENT G056
