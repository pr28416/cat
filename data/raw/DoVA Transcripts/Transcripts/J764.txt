@@@ from you is @@@ the problem you are having but from another @@@ you know, @@@ just because I don't want all this information @@@.

Just because @@@.

PATIENT J764
Okay, @@@.

DOCTOR J764
@@@ right.

DOCTOR J764
That is the reason okay.  Uh Actually I won't be able to give you an answer uh at the same time it would make very @@@ as far as your prostate problem is concerned, @@@ okay.  How do you take that?

SECOND DOCTOR J764
Okay.  You understand you're at a completely different hospital right?

PATIENT J764
Yeah I understand that.

SECOND DOCTOR J764
Okay.  So I think part of it is you just don't really want to get involved @@@ extensive work right now.  

PATIENT J764
No.

SECOND DOCTOR J764
If you would like to transfer your care over here, we can do that but you realize that you know we want you to always come back here @@@.  So I guess the question is do you want to have all your care delivered here?

PATIENT J764

SECOND DOCTOR J764
So does that mean you're going to go back over there?

PATIENT J764
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT J764
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR J764
Alright and you're looking to @@@ so um number one your options are um we can, there are a whole bunch of things that can cause uh numbness and tingling in your feet and the first would be @@@ we need to check labs which is what @@@ so.

PATIENT J764
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR J764
Um our question is whether you want to go ahead and start that @@@ they should be able to get those results at Jesse Brown uh but ultimately we would like to maybe follow up with that, so I guess the question is do you want us to order that today or if you would want um, if you want to just have it over there, it's your call.

PATIENT J764
What kind of blood test are you doing?

SECOND DOCTOR J764
It's a blood test.  We'd check your thyroid levels, we'd check your um, um, @@@.  We'd check your thyroid levels, we'd check your iron levels um and we'd check your vitamin levels as well @@@.

PATIENT J764
Uh-huh.  You could do that today?

SECOND DOCTOR J764
Yeah we'd have to give you a call for the results and DOCTOR would probably give you a call tomorrow.

PATIENT J764

SECOND DOCTOR J764
And how are you doing uh, so no chest pain since then it sounds like huh?

PATIENT J764
Not uh since that day.

SECOND DOCTOR J764

PATIENT J764
No, no, no, no.

SECOND DOCTOR J764
But and so DOCTOR will write down the labs we recommend that you can take to Jesse Brown, they can figure it out and if something doesn't work or you want to bring your care back over here, then @@@.  You know, okay.
