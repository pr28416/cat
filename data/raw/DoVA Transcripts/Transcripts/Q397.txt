PATIENT Q397
Yeah I had, it pains like right there but @@@.  I had a pain halfway up the back on this side, on this side okay.

DOCTOR Q397
Okay.

PATIENT Q397
Uh when I lay on my back or lay down on my side for a while, all of a sudden you know you've got centered.  So I figured well I probably tore a ligament you know and after about three or four weeks it went away.

DOCTOR Q397
They won't do the test right there, they'll schedule it cause you need to take this prep and everything and they usually schedule it for like a month or so okay.  But they won't do the test right away.  They need to look at these labs and there's a bureaucratic way of doing it.

PATIENT Q397
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR Q397
You have to schedule it.  Just because they have a bunch and they need to schedule them.

PATIENT Q397

PATIENT Q397
Okay the problem I have is my sister usually comes to the house for me but she's in her 70s and she's kind of unreliable.

DOCTOR Q397
Okay, so what you can do is maybe request a certain day.  Are certain days better?

DOCTOR Q397
We'll find out next week.

PATIENT Q397
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Q397
With the lab tests.

PATIENT Q397
Alright.

DOCTOR Q397
The problem with the kidneys is you really don't know if they're really bad until they're really bad usually what happens is that when you feel it.

PATIENT Q397
Alright, okay.

DOCTOR Q397
Um your kidneys, like I said they're working 50% to 60% of what they should.  The best way to prevent them from getting worse is keep controlling the blood pressure which is why I'm being aggressive your blood pressure.

PATIENT Q397
Good.

DOCTOR Q397
Okay.

PATIENT Q397
@@@.

DOCTOR Q397
You know even though I got a lower value here and that cuff was a little bigger you know, if you check it at home daily and it's running 140 to 150, that leads me to want to treat it more aggressively.

PATIENT Q397
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR Q397
You know so all the data shows that if you keep your sugar under the control, but more so the blood pressure in diabetics, you can perhaps slow down the progression of the kidney disease.  You can't stop it per se but you can really slow it down okay.

PATIENT Q397
Well.

DOCTOR Q397
And I do know people who have been at like 2, 2.2, 2.5 which is about 30%, 35% of normal kidney function um for years.

PATIENT Q397
Alright and I'm at what?.

DOCTOR Q397
Your numbers not important.

Alright yeah.

DOCTOR Q397
You're at 1.8.

PATIENT Q397
