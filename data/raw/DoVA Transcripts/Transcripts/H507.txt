DOCTOR H507
@@@ for you.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
I have my brief notes So on September 11, you had a kidney stone.  You went into an acute renal failure.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
And then you had the pulmonary edema and then back to the ICU and only just back into the real world.

PATIENT H507
And then I had uh two visits to the Emergency Room since then.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah with the bleeding.

PATIENT H507
The bleeding and the blood clots in my legs yeah.

DOCTOR H507
And then Urology saw you both times and basically you went to Urology they wanted to see you as soon as possible, uh October 5th okay.

SECOND PERSON H507
No I think

PATIENT H507
So that was cancelled.

SECOND PERSON H507
They told us to cancel it.

PATIENT H507
The last time I was in the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR H507
Oh they did @@@.

PATIENT H507
The surgeons had put in the stint said there was no need cause that was basically Monday.

DOCTOR H507
Hmm, right.

PATIENT H507
Around Monday.  She said there was no need for me to come.

DOCTOR H507
@@@.

PATIENT H507
Right.

DOCTOR H507
Okay so is it just mostly the GU issues, the Urology issues that are getting you down for the moment?

PATIENT H507
Right, both right.  I just.  She wants me to rest so I don't, to control the bleeding whatever you know and they also want me to exercise to build my strength back up again.

DOCTOR H507
Right.

PATIENT H507
So it's like.

DOCTOR H507
Take one go to another one.

PATIENT H507
Take one go to another one.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.  But you know anytime you get someone admitted for a prolonged stay at the hospital there's always some sort of deconditioning that goes with it you're in the hospital, you're not sleeping well; we're not exactly feeding you everything yeah.

PATIENT H507
You eat a little right yeah.

DOCTOR H507
And then you know you're also sick and you're fighting against an infection.

PATIENT H507
Right.

DOCTOR H507
So that's the kind of thing.  So any sort of recovery after that is gonna take time.  Uh my question is besides the weakness at home how have you been?

PATIENT H507
I think I'm feeling good.

DOCTOR H507
Doing okay.

SECOND PERSON H507
He's doing better.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  So let's start with the urology issues, I mean how are you urinating right now?

PATIENT H507
I'm urinating fine uh.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
As of this morning my urine was @@@.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
Uh that's @@@ you know.

DOCTOR H507
Oh that is.

PATIENT H507
Because the bleeding that came out, it was at the time, I really didn't exert myself.

DOCTOR H507
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H507
You know, if I can get the stents out the sooner the better I think would be but from I understand it, the scheduling issues with the urologist.

DOCTOR H507
They're a busy service, Urology.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
But no blood in the urine right now.

PATIENT H507
Right, well as of this morning that's it no.

DOCTOR H507
Uh any pain when you urinate?

PATIENT H507
No.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
No pain.

DOCTOR H507
Now are you going to the bathroom more often, less often or about as normally as you usually do?

PATIENT H507
I would say probably more often.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  So are you drinking more water you think?

PATIENT H507
I'm drinking fluids right yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  Did they tell you to increase your fluids?

SECOND PERSON H507
No they put a restriction on his fluids when he was in the hospital.

PATIENT H507
I was on fluid restriction when I was in the hospital. 

SECOND PERSON H507
@@@ I think.

DOCTOR H507
Your kidneys weren’t really working.

PATIENT H507
Right.

SECOND PERSON H507
Right.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
But this last time uh in the Emergency Room, you know it was like.

DOCTOR H507
Oh go back to regular @@@.

PATIENT H507
Right.

DOCTOR H507
Not too much, not too little.  Okay.  Now any fevers or chills?

PATIENT H507
No.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  Any pain along the back?

PATIENT H507
I'm still taking the Cipro for another.

SECOND PERSON H507
@@@.

PATIENT H507
I think the end of the week, I think that's.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

SECOND PERSON H507
That's right.

DOCTOR H507
Okay, so no fevers, chills.  Any nausea or vomiting?

PATIENT H507
No.

DOCTOR H507
Are you eating everything okay at home?

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Your appetite's fine?

PATIENT H507
Appetite’s good.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  Sleeping okay at night?

PATIENT H507
Uh not really.  I sleep like from yeah maybe 2 hours, 2 1/2 hours tops.

DOCTOR H507
What happens um?

PATIENT H507
Well I wake up.  Sometimes I wake you know have to go and urinate you know and then I come.

(Someone knocks on the door)

DOCTOR H507
Okay sleeping 2-3 hours at a time and then waking up.  Is there anything in particular that you feel is waking you up.  I mean are you in pain?

PATIENT H507
No just can't sleep.

DOCTOR H507
Anything bothering you?  No.

SECOND PERSON H507
@@@.

PATIENT H507
I have, prior to all this situation; I had you know I guess you'd call it restless leg syndrome, leg pain, once or twice a month.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
I don't if there's a...

DOCTOR H507
Have you ever had in the past have you had a sleep study done to check for sleep apnea?

PATIENT H507
No.

DOCTOR H507
No.  Okay.  Ah, let me ask you a few questions in that aspect, I mean have you ever been told that you snore, snore excessively?

SECOND PERSON H507
He's never snored, no.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
Not that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR H507
@@@ and then in the morning when you do sleep, and you wake up do you feel pretty refreshed or do you still feel pretty tired when you wake up?

PATIENT H507
Well normally I feel refreshed but with all this that's going on I don't feel like and when I wake up I'm not.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  So this is new, this whole waking up @@@.

PATIENT H507
It's, no, @@@ like you know it's not like I'm @@@.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
Okay then @@@ don’t have any energy.

SECOND PERSON H507
But most of the time since the hospital.

PATIENT H507
Right since the hospital.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  So.

PATIENT H507
And even if I take you know like a nap you know during the day and all that, I'm not, ready to bounce out of bed.

DOCTOR H507
Do you feel like you fall asleep pretty easily during the day?

PATIENT H507
Yes.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  So if we kind of left you alone in this room for ten minutes do you think you'd dose off?

PATIENT H507
No.

DOCTOR H507
No.

PATIENT H507
But maybe even @@@.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  So this is the most important question I guess, has anyone ever expressed to you that you stop breathing at night while you're sleeping, any problem with that?

PATIENT H507
@@@.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  Alright so.  Uh something you can consider but there's really not a lot of clinical issues to support doing a sleep study right now.  One of the things that can cause restless leg is people who have sleep apnea, people who have these sort of events overnight when they stop breathing.

PATIENT H507
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H507
But right now I think the thing that’s going to build your strength and everything back up after the hospitalization.  Let me go through your most recent blood work and see if there's anything that really stands out to me.  I know they check your urine a lot and basically every time it was @@@ as far as your last blood test and you've had a lot of them actually.

PATIENT H507
Yes they do.

DOCTOR H507
Especially being in the hospital.

PATIENT H507
If I have any blood left.

DOCTOR H507
So I mean that's fine.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.  I have a history of low platelets.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.  @@@.  Um okay.  So that's from the hospital point of view.  Uh how far are you able to walk right now before you have any problems?

PATIENT H507
Probably to @@@.

DOCTOR H507
Is the wheelchair new since being discharged or is it something you?

PATIENT H507
No I knew that I couldn't walk from valet you know all the way over here.  I knew I couldn't walk that far.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  But then before you had this most recent hospitalization were you able to @@@.

PATIENT H507
Oh yeah, yeah.  Oh yeah.

SECOND PERSON H507
Yes.

DOCTOR H507
Okay you were walking then.

PATIENT H507
Yeah, no that's good.

SECOND PERSON H507
Probably because he's kind of weak.  That’s all it is.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  Now have you started uh have you done any form of physical therapy or rehabilitation since discharge?

SECOND PERSON H507
Well they told him to walk.

PATIENT H507
No they just told me to.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
Just do walking but I didn't need any you know.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H507
But then when the bleeding started she said to stop walking.

PATIENT H507
To stop walking.

SECOND PERSON H507
So you know he was not.

PATIENT H507
Like it's a Catch 22 you know.

DOCTOR H507
Alright.

PATIENT H507
That's kind of what I'm saying today you know life says stop with the blood now I'm like you know this afternoon it might start back up again, just a little bit of.

DOCTOR H507
With a little bit of exertion?

SECOND PERSON H507
Right.

PATIENT H507
The walking that I've done and it really isn't exerting.  I mean it's not like I'm lifting something or anything like that.

DOCTOR H507
I think a couple of things to keep in mind, first of all it only takes a little bit of blood to discolor the whole urine.  The other thing is you know whatever caused this bleeding, you’ve got a stent in.

PATIENT H507
Yeah that's what they did yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Um right and that's always gonna be there and that's gonna cause irritation that kind of thing until they take it out.

PATIENT H507
Uh-huh right.

DOCTOR H507
And then whatever was bleeding tends to clot and if those clots, sometimes they could dislodged.  It's more common with stents, it's more common in the bladder but um anyway you know because you do have bleeding kind of like that.  As long as it's not, you know if it's pink pink urine.

PATIENT H507
This is like cranberry juice.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.

PATIENT H507
I mean it started dark.

DOCTOR H507
That's dark.

PATIENT H507
It's darker yeah.  It's darker yeah, it's not.

SECOND PERSON H507
@@@.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  Alright so I mean Urology has seen you just recently and they're the experts in that.  That's not my area of expertise.

PATIENT H507
Oh.

DOCTOR H507
I'll let them manage that.  Uh let's focus on some of your other sort of more medical problems which uh hypertension.  So today in clinic blood pressure not doing so bad 130/60, so I'm happy with that.  Uh your pulse was a little fast so I'll recheck that in just a minute.

PATIENT H507
It's normally; my normal pulse is between 90 and 100.

DOCTOR H507
90 and 100 okay.  So I think it's over 100, we just want to make sure.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
So yours was 104, so I'll just double check it.

PATIENT H507
Oh in a minute yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Okay just so fair warning, you're right-handed.  

PATIENT H507
Cause everybody when I come here everybody says you know are you nervous about being here and I go no, no that's normal for me.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
And I don't notice that it's.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
You know that it's fast.

DOCTOR H507
And you're not having any palpitations?

PATIENT H507
Right.

DOCTOR H507
Chest pain, anxiety, no okay.  So then the other thing is the hyperlipidemia.  So the last time you had your cholesterol checked, it was actually very recently I think September 17th which was a couple of weeks ago.

PATIENT H507
When I was in the hospital.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah, it seemed that they checked it in the hospital, it's usually not a hospital test that they usually do @@@.

SECOND PERSON H507
They tested him for everything.

PATIENT H507
Yeah everything.

DOCTOR H507
Figured while you were there why not right?

PATIENT H507
Right.

DOCTOR H507
So uh the bad cholesterol is fine, it's well controlled actually and then your triglycerides look fine.  The good cholesterol was a little bit low but I'm not going to chase that number right now, since  you’ve gone through that whole ordeal so I'll wait at this time.  I refilled your medications so do you need any of those?

PATIENT H507
Oh okay.

DOCTOR H507
And then the Lantus, the test strips, and they ordered a Coude catheter I don't know why they did that.

SECOND PERSON H507
@@@

PATIENT H507
No.

SECOND PERSON H507
You never know.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah let me, let me, let me discontinue that.

PATIENT H507
That was ill-advised.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.  That's supposed to be a one way street you know.  It was really supposed to come out then.

SECOND PERSON H507
Exactly.

PATIENT H507
@@@.  DOCTOR said when I saw him, he never should have.

SECOND PERSON H507
Ever.

patient h495
With my history of low platelets.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
And all that he says it never should've @@@.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

SECOND PERSON H507
@@@.

PATIENT H507
Been put on that to begin with.  

DOCTOR H507
And then the statin I refilled.

PATIENT H507
Okay.

DOCTOR H507
Uh the metformin I also reordered and the Losartan I reordered.  The finasteride for the prostate I also reordered.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
And then the Cipro they gave you enough for to finish the treatment so I don't think you have to worry about that and now was there anything else?

PATIENT H507
The only post treatment, that there's any question about it is the I have @@@.

DOCTOR H507
Tamsulosin?

PATIENT H507
Yes.

DOCTOR H507
Um.

SECOND PERSON H507
Is that the @@@ medicine?  It thins the blood?

PATIENT H507
@@@.

DOCTOR H507
No BP or BPH.

SECOND PERSON H507
Blood pressure, blood pressure.

PATIENT H507
Blood pressure.

DOCTOR H507
Okay, okay.  

PATIENT H507
I get like a dry cough.

DOCTOR H507
Okay so uh Losartan.

PATIENT H507
I've heard that some blood pressure medicines.

DOCTOR H507
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H507
Can cause that sort of thing.  So it's not a constant thing but I.

DOCTOR H507
The ones that most commonly cause it are called ACE inhibitors and uh those are medications like lisinopril or Captopril.  They all have a pril ending.

PATIENT H507
Hmm.

DOCTOR H507
And then what happens is after that we got a new generation of medicines that kind of work in a similar fashion but they don't have that side effect and those are something called ARP and that's a medication like Losartan.

SECOND PERSON H507
And that's what he's on.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah so we just need to get it down.  Losartan does not cause that.

SECOND PERSON H507
Okay.  Okay, probably something else.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.  I have a question about the medications.  Is there any way that I'm assuming that you probably just reordered the @@@ just has been in the past.  Is there any way to increase the metformin and the simvastatin so I’m not reordering that?

DOCTOR H507
Yeah I think what I did was I have to put everything in for 90 days.

PATIENT H507
Yeah, yeah.  Because yeah it's something I'm gonna be on.

DOCTOR H507
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H507
And having to reorder you know.

SECOND PERSON H507
Constantly.

PATIENT H507
Constantly every month uh.

DOCTOR H507
So I'm just looking through it, I'm making sure that I think that's yeah, that's what I did for every.

PATIENT H507
Okay.

DOCTOR H507
I think that's the most that the VA will actually let me do.

SECOND PERSON H507
That's much better than 30 days’ worth.  So.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
So 90 days and then three refills is as many as they'll let me fill.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H507
Per year?

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H507
Sure.

PATIENT H507
I get it.  And the simvastatin is the only one @@@ reordered it.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
He probably said you need to fill it.  @@@.

DOCTOR H507
So all that's taken care of.

PATIENT H507
That's all good.

DOCTOR H507
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON H507
So now does he have to reorder it or they're all gonna be ordered so you just put in the prescriptions but they're not @@@.

PATIENT H507
They're there yeah.

DOCTOR H507
So I put in the prescription and just like before.  So you'll call the VA.

PATIENT H507
So we will just continue right.

DOCTOR H507
And then next time they'll send you 90 days’ worth.

PATIENT H507
Okay.

DOCTOR H507
With three refills.

PATIENT H507
Okay.  The only other thing I got is and I don’t think you can do this is helping moving up the.

DOCTOR H507
Oh the stent, have the stent removed?

PATIENT H507
Stent removal.

DOCTOR H507
Oh.  @@@.

(Someone comes to the door and the doctor visits with them)

PATIENT H507
Leave from here yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Anyway.

SECOND PERSON H507
No the issue with the bleeding is that we feel that you know they have him bleeding intermittently for the next six weeks.

PATIENT H507
For six more weeks.

SECOND PERSON H507
Sounds like an awfully long time and the cause of it could be gotten out of there.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H507
You know what you know who wants to have bled for six weeks?  Cause this seems like so long.  And they said it was a scheduling issue you know well, the body can handle it.

DOCTOR H507
Well no I understand, I feel the same way and to be honest I mean there's not a lot I can do from my end.

SECOND PERSON H507
I know, we understand.

DOCTOR H507
They don't let me go in there and take the stents out ourselves, that's the problem.

PATIENT H507
No I know.

SECOND PERSON H507
But we were hoping you could put a word in or something.

PATIENT H507
She did say, the surgeon she did say what was it Monday at noon @@@ she was going to try to do something to move it up I don't know.  But uh you know, six weeks of watching every time that I you know I mean it's all there.  Sometimes you know just wait like I'm saying I might go home today now and sometimes the little bit of walking that I'm doing might enough.

SECOND PERSON H507
@@@.

PATIENT H507
@@@ prostate yeah but.  

SECOND PERSON H507
And can you get a flu shot too?

PATIENT H507
Oh yeah the flu shot and the pneumonia shot.  The nurse wanted to give it but I wanted to talk to you first.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.

PATIENT H507
Because being on.

DOCTOR H507
The antibiotics you're on.

PATIENT H507
Antibiotic and all that.

SECOND PERSON H507
He just had a staph infection.

PATIENT H507
Should I hold off on it or take it now?

DOCTOR H507
You can come back in a week and just come back and tell them that you need to get the shots, come down again.  Cause you'll be done with your antibiotics by them.

PATIENT H507
But wait, so wait until I am off?

DOCTOR H507
Yeah, yeah and it's not you know really there's no I mean we could do it today but I'm just gonna be more of a cautious guy than @@@.

PATIENT H507
That's what I thought cause you know that maybe it was yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.  Because again you're not having any symptoms and it looks like the antibiotics are doing their jobs.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Give it a while.  I mean if it's convenient for you to come back in a week but by all means.

PATIENT H507
Well I got to come back in.

SECOND PERSON H507
I think while he was in the hospital he had a staph infection and then you know oh you'll go home with antibiotics but he kept being allergic to everything.

PATIENT H507
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  

SECOND PERSON H507
So they introduced another thing now, it's kind of scary.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah so we'll.

SECOND PERSON H507
But that's what they wanted to do @@@ flu.

PATIENT H507
Right.  Well why don't you set it up, cause I'm coming back for.

DOCTOR H507
Actually, you know what, you know what I'll do is I'll ask DOCTOR my senior physician and I'm pretty sure that the flu would be okay to get it today and then the pneumovac -  I'm gonna see if you can wait or not wait.  I personally don't have a strong preference but I'll see if my attending physician has a strong preference for now okay.

SECOND PERSON H507
Cause he did have the flu lungs it's just kind of scary though but whatever you think is right.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  The last time they checked your blood sugar level, that hemoglobin A1c which tells us how well your sugars has been controlled for three months um it was very @@@.  Your number was like perfect.

PATIENT H507
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON H507
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H507
5.7 I mean like it's amazing.  I think it affects.

PATIENT H507
No I haven't, I haven't been taking my metformin.

DOCTOR H507
Right cause you had the renal failure.

PATIENT H507
And because and the Cipro the pharmacist said not to take it while I'm on Cipro.

DOCTOR H507
Now when you're checking your blood sugars at home how have they been?

PATIENT H507
120, 140.

DOCTOR H507
140 okay.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.  I think I'm really border, I'm borderline yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Borderline diabetic.

SECOND PERSON H507
Yeah.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  So again uh it's okay if the sugars are, you know like if we don't control them so tightly as long as they're below 200, 250 I'm fine.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Like a small window.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  So the diabetes is fine.

PATIENT H507
I think we got that controlled pretty good.

DOCTOR H507
Okay and then Urology is following you so that's fine.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  So why don't you go ahead and have a seat up here.  Go ahead and @@@.

PATIENT H507
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H507
Have you noticed any swelling in your legs?  @@@.

PATIENT H507
Yeah I mean walking @@@.

DOCTOR H507
@@@.

PATIENT H507
@@@ It's an overall @@@.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

SECOND PERSON H507
Exhausted.

PATIENT H507
Exhausted, yeah. And it's not like exhausted just cause I can't do anything else it's just that I @@@.

DOCTOR H507
Now have you been getting better since your discharge, since you left the hospital like every day are you making some progress?

SECOND PERSON H507
I think so until the set back.

PATIENT H507
Then I start @@@ down.

SECOND PERSON H507
Well I think he went backwards on that.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

SECOND PERSON H507
But before that, for ten days before that that he felt like @@@.

PATIENT H507
Oh yeah, oh yeah I was definitely improved from when I was discharged yeah.

SECOND PERSON H507
With all that again and.

DOCTOR H507
Okay. Cause I was making sure that you weren’t losing too much blood. It doesn't look like that’s the case, they checked just a couple days ago.

SECOND PATIENT H507
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT H507
And so.

DOCTOR H507
Let's take a look.

SECOND PERSON H507
Yeah he's got color back.  You were pasty for a while.  You look much better you know look at you, you look like you’re healthier now.

DOCTOR H507
Take a deep breath and again, deep breath and again.  @@@.  Nice deep breath with your mouth open and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out.  Alright.  Now before when someone's listened to your heart have they ever told you that they hear a murmur or anything like that?

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H507
Yes.

DOCTOR H507
Okay so that's not new.  That's something that's been there for years?  Okay.  Chin up for me. Can you lean forward?  Take a deep breath and out, okay.

PATIENT H507
When I was in the hospital they said I needed to get an echocardiogram.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
To see if the valve leaks.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.  Did you ever do one of the neck. Just curious.

PATIENT H507
I don’t remember.

DOCTOR H507
@@@ The reason is that the heart murmur that you have, in some people what it can do is it can travel up the neck which is fine but I'm not concerned about it.  If I hear a murmur that's just in the neck then that's something I'd want to investigate.

PATIENT H507
Hmm.  I don't think they did.

DOCTOR H507
Okay.

PATIENT H507
@@@.

DOCTOR H507
Well here's the thing, when I marked @@@ the heart, marking it up.

PATIENT H507
Right.

DOCTOR H507
This @@@.  Deep breath in and again.  @@@ Carotid @@@ good seal over there.  Okay.  Any problems with dizziness, lightheadedness?  No nothing like that.  Any chest pains.

PATIENT H507
No.

DOCTOR H507
Shortness of breath?

PATIENT H507
No.

DOCTOR H507
No.  Trouble breathing when you're lying flat at night?

PATIENT H507
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR H507
But you can do it?

PATIENT H507
I can do it @@@.

DOCTOR H507
Alright @@@.

PATIENT H507
Right.  I was laying on my side again.  

DOCTOR H507
Okay so @@@.

PATIENT H507
@@@.

DOCTOR H507
@@@.  Can you remove your glasses for me?  I want to take a look into your eyes.  Stare at my nose.  Okay.  @@@.  Alright.  I'm gonna go ahead and pull your eyelids down for me, I just want to take a look.  Alright.

PATIENT H507
@@@.

DOCTOR H507
Just um @@@ dark irises.  

PATIENT H507
Oh.

DOCTOR H507
A very unique coloration.

PATIENT H507
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H507
@@@.  Over okay.  Then another thing is @@@ um the reason why we @@@, the reason why we'd be interested in looking at the eyes is you when we pull your eyelids down, you know there are a lot of blood vessels @@@ white @@@ then that’s when I’d be concerned.  

SECOND PERSON H507
@@@.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.

PATIENT H507
Mine are okay? 

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.  Your’s are okay @@@.  And if your blood pressure was high as well.  @@@.  Now things that would tell me you know if you @@@things I would be concerned for anemia you know you're having shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, that kind of thing, so if that starts to happen, that's when you come into the Emergency Department and call me and should probably check your hemoglobin level and make sure everything's okay.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
But.

PATIENT H507
Oh she also told me that she that she wasn’t too concerned about the clots as long as I was passing it.

DOCTOR H507
Right.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.  She said if I wanted to you know, @@@.

DOCTOR H507
You can't urinate.

PATIENT H507
You can't urinate and then get back in right away.

DOCTOR H507
@@@ there you go.  @@@ yeah she got it covered.  Alright so what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna go outside and talk to DOCTOR and double check about the Pneumovax vaccine and the flu um there's really not much else that we need to address today.  Blood pressure looks like it’s doing okay.  Lipids are fine.  The diabetes is a well under control so it's okay to hold the metformin for now and then.

SECOND PERSON H507
He @@@ after the Cipro?

PATIENT H507
Right.

DOCTOR H507
Yeah.  Give me a second @@@.

SECOND PERSON H507
Okay.

DOCTOR H507
Alright so I'll be right back.

PATIENT H507
Okay.

DOCTOR H507
I have a feeling when I come back I'm gonna schedule this here. @@@.

SECOND PERSON H507
Oh no @@@.

DOCTOR OUT:  71:45  DOCTOR IN:  79:50

DOCTOR H507
Alright.  Okay so actually um like I said earlier, I was sitting on the fence with the Pneumovax.  The only contraindication would be if you actually had signs of an active infection.  Uh in patients actually so what happens patients come, they're at risk for pneumonia and if they have in an infection we treat them for pneumonia and then before they get discharged um we can give them the vaccine so it's very safe.  So yes today for influenza and yes to the pneumonia vaccine today.

SECOND PERSON H507
Alright.

PATIENT H507
Okay.

DOCTOR H507
Alright.  So then I told the nurse and they're gonna start setting that up for you so when you're getting ready to leave you should be ready to go.

SECOND PERSON H507
Okay.

DOCTOR H507
Uh any other questions for me?  I think that uh so things are going really well right now um.  Mostly your health problems are very well controlled.  It's just you had this stone and then all these complications that came as a result.

PATIENT H507
Yeah.

DOCTOR H507
So Urology is really @@@ point on that.  Now if you've had any problems you're always welcome to come back and see me um but if everything stays the course I think a year would be fine to come back.

SECOND PERSON H507
Oh sure.

PATIENT H507
Are you gonna be here in a year?

DOCTOR H507
Oh I'll be here for at least three years.

PATIENT H507
