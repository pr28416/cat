DOCTOR M903 
PATIENT.  How are you?

PATIENT M903
Okay.

DOCTOR M903

PATIENT M903
To the left or the right?

DOCTOR M903
To the right, all the way back to the right.

PATIENT M903
Okay.  @@@ turn right.

DOCTOR M903
Take your time, take your time.

PATIENT M903
To the right and to the left.

DOCTOR M903
So you guys have had a lot of things to do since the last time I saw you.

PATIENT M903
Ah yes.

DOCTOR M903
Yes and it looks like you've done a lot of them.

PATIENT M903
I've done everything.

SECOND PERSON M903
@@@ he did five in the last month.

PATIENT M903
Except the MRI that you cancelled.

DOCTOR M903
Huh?

PATIENT M903
The MRI that you cancelled.

DOCTOR M903
When did you do the CT?

PATIENT M903
I did the CT already.

DOCTOR M903
I think they can't send you for an MRI because your, you have the what do you call the hardware in your neck right.

PATIENT M903
Right.

SECOND PERSON M903
Oh.

DOCTOR M903
I don't think you can go because of that.  Or do you have a pacemaker PATIENT?

PATIENT M903
No I don't.

DOCTOR M903
You don't hmm.  For some reason we had to cancel that MRI because yeah it was contraindicated for a reason that I can't quite recall but.

PATIENT M903
No.

SECOND PERSON M903
@@@ tests @@@.

DOCTOR M903
Uh we did.  I think we've come upon something now.

SECOND PERSON M903
Oh.

DOCTOR M903
When we visited the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation doctor because of the problems with the stride and the walking, do you guys remember what he told you?

PATIENT M903
Right.

DOCTOR M903
What did he tell you was going on?

PATIENT M903
He scheduled me for something else.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M903
For my eyes as a matter of fact.

DOCTOR M903
He did.

PATIENT M903
And a swallow test.

DOCTOR M903
Yep.

PATIENT M903
And uh I think that was it.

SECOND PERSON M903
So what'd you find out?

DOCTOR M903
So what he thinks is going on is um you might have a syndrome that's very, very similar to Parkinson's disease.  So not maybe Parkinson's disease specifically, but so there are a whole range of things that are very similar.

PATIENT M903
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
And there were things that he saw when he evaluated you so when you write you write really small.

PATIENT M903
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
On the micrographia and when you move you tend to move very slowly, that's what we call bradykinesia and you know the way that he watched you walk, all of these and then that combined with the falls.

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
And the difficulty maintaining your blood pressure when you're moving a whole lot.

PATIENT M903
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
He thinks that's what's going on.  So now it's a matter of what are we gonna do next.

PATIENT M903
Right.

DOCTOR M903
There are medications available for this.  

PATIENT M903
(Patient makes a noise.)

DOCTOR M903
Which I know you're not excited about medication.

PATIENT M903
I am so sick of taking medications.

SECOND PERSON M903
His legs is paining him now too.  Tell her.

PATIENT M903
Right.  I've been walking too much.

SECOND PERSON M903
He only walks @@@.

PATIENT M903
Today I have.

SECOND PERSON M903
PATIENT, he waited in the car, came here and walked from the parking lot.

PATIENT M903
That take effort.

SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah and his nose is bleeding.

PATIENT M903
Yeah my nose has been bleeding all morning.

DOCTOR M903
Hmm.  Are you taking any medications that thin your blood?

PATIENT M903
I don't think so.

SECOND PERSON M903
@@@ up in his nose.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON M903
And it's irritating so he @@@.

DOCTOR M903
Then that's exactly why it's bleeding.  You kind of just need to leave it alone.

PATIENT M903
It just started this morning though.

SECOND PERSON M903
You know with that scab @@@ he probably shouldn't do that you know.

DOCTOR M903
Yeah.  We're just gonna have to keep the inside of your nose very well moisturized.

SECOND PERSON M903
That's why I told him to put some Vaseline up in there but.

DOCTOR M903
You could use Vaseline.

SECOND PERSON M903
@@@ you know.

DOCTOR M903
And you can use a saline spray.

SECOND PERSON M903
You know this is something new.  He fell twice yesterday.

PATIENT M903
Did I?

SECOND PERSON M903
Yes you did.  When we came out of church.

PATIENT M903
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR M903
Are you using, I don't see that you're using your cane today.

PATIENT M903
I forgot it this morning.

SECOND PERSON M903
He has been, he has been.

DOCTOR M903
Yeah.  I don't think that's gonna be optional anymore PATIENT.

PATIENT M903
I understand but I just forgot it cause I was rushing to get here because we woke up late.

DOCTOR M903
Absolutely.

SECOND PERSON M903
It was not a good night @@@.

PATIENT M903
I woke you up at 10 to 8 didn't I?

SECOND PERSON M903
No.

PATIENT M903
Okay.

DOCTOR M903
So I think.

PATIENT M903
Now what'd they see in the x-rays?

DOCTOR M903
Um I don't think anything has changed too much on the imaging.  Um in terms of your neck.

PATIENT M903
Right.

DOCTOR M903
Are you still having the neck pain?

PATIENT M903
Yes.

SECOND PERSON M903
Wasn't that you who called and said that ya'll seen that one @@@.

DOCTOR M903
So uh a little bit of a change but nothing major so I don't think.

SECOND PERSON M903
But it still bothers him.

PATIENT M903
It feel like its damn heavy behind my ear now.

SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
Is it pain?

PATIENT M903
That where it feel like the plate is.

DOCTOR M903
The plate is?  So we definitely do not see that at all because that would have been an abnormality.

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
And we would've have uh called you in and um so they didn't find any evidence of a fracture or subluxation which means like they didn't find any where the two parts of the vertebrae sort of aren't aligned anymore.  Um.

SECOND PERSON M903
But when he be getting up, like if he get up out the chair like this.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M903
I fall back.

SECOND PERSON M903
And falls back I told him he be getting up too fast but sometimes he really don't get up that fast.

DOCTOR M903
That is due to what we think is the Parkinson's disease.

SECOND PERSON M903
Oh.

DOCTOR M903
All of that is tied together so the falls, the problems with the gait, you know we're gonna say all of that and the blood pressure issues, all of that is tied together.

SECOND PERSON M903
Oh.

DOCTOR M903
So I think we're gonna have to go seeing a neurologist cause they're the ones who really manage this okay and they'll be able to start you on some medications.  So I already put in for the consult but it doesn't look like they've responded to it so I'll put in for it again and I'll call them today.

PATIENT M903
Okay.

DOCTOR M903
So they can get in touch with you and you can get in to see them.

SECOND PERSON M903
And you call the number to go get the driver's test?

DOCTOR M903
Yep.

PATIENT M903
Probably Hines VA.

DOCTOR M903
Yep.

SECOND PERSON M903
I told him, you know what I'm saying.

DOCTOR M903
It's not that I don't want you to drive.

SECOND PERSON M903
@@@.

DOCTOR M903
It's not safe.

SECOND PERSON M903
I know it's not cause I've been riding with him.

PATIENT M903
(Laughs)

DOCTOR M903
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON M903
I know.

DOCTOR M903
So we've got to look at.

SECOND PERSON M903
I'm going to insist that he's not going to drive.

DOCTOR M903
Good, good, good. Um so those are the big things for us right now.  

PATIENT M903
@@@.

SECOND PERSON M903
@@@.

PATIENT M903
I @@@ garbage.

DOCTOR M903
And then did you get that reacher?

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
Okay and have you been using that at home?

SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M903
I think I used it once.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

SECOND PERSON M903
He been reaching to get that, I told him to put it closer.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

SECOND PERSON M903
So he been using it.  He does use his cane @@@ the day.

DOCTOR M903
@@@.

PATIENT M903
Oh we're @@@.

DOCTOR M903
Oh okay, that's okay.  So @@@ Um when you're having those kind of nosebleeds you have to be very gentle with your nose.  You can't keep blowing it.  All you want to do, I know it's irritating, is hold out, @@@.  Hold the tissue up to your nose and try not to blow, just hold it.

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
And then right here on the bridge of your nose hold down.

SECOND PERSON M903
Now see that has started happening like this.

PATIENT M903
This morning.

SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah this just started happening, it hasn't been like that.

DOCTOR M903
Just hold it.

SECOND PERSON M903
But @@@ I saw @@@ it get all @@@ I can tell when he needs to blow his nose @@@ but then he @@@ blow it @@@ you know not blood, mucous you know come out.

PATIENT M903
Hmm.

DOCTOR M903
Don't blow okay.  You just want to hold pressure here to prevent it from bleeding and help it clot.  I know it's irritating in here and you want to blow it out but you're not gonna be able to because there's a scab in it.

PATIENT M903
I have to breathe.

SECOND PERSON M903
Oh he definitely had a scab.

DOCTOR M903
You can breathe through your mouth.

PATIENT M903
Oh.

DOCTOR M903
Breathe through your mouth okay.

PATIENT M903
Hmm.

SECOND PERSON M903
But he always be picking at it you know.

DOCTOR M903
Yeah don't pick it.

SECOND PERSON M903
Don't do that, cause I looked up there.

DOCTOR M903
You're not giving it a chance to heal.

SECOND PERSON M903
I was just seeing that he was blowing and I told him not to pick it, just leave it.  I was gonna put some Vaseline in it.

DOCTOR M903
Vaseline and we'll get you some saline spray today.

SECOND PERSON M903
And I bring him here doctor.

PATIENT M903
Wow.  Yes ma'am.

SECOND PERSON M903
Listen to her.

PATIENT M903
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.  Alright.  So that's kind of where we are with that so I think the big key, you know, how much the medications are gonna be able to help is really unclear.  It just depends on how you respond to them.  So I think the big key is it's gonna be some changing lifestyle stuff so using your cane, using the reacher.  Try not to get into situations where you're bending over a lot or coming back up.

SECOND PERSON M903
Right.

DOCTOR M903
No sudden motions.  You want to do everything gingerly.

SECOND PERSON M903
Slow.

DOCTOR M903
Because the issue is your body is having a hard time regulating.

PATIENT M903
Oh.

DOCTOR M903
Your blood pressure so when I move up and down like this my body's able to maintain my blood pressure so I don't feel woozy when I come back up and this way I don't fall backwards.  Well one of the things that you find with this disease is that your body has a hard time doing that it's what we call postural hypotension.  So depending on what, you know, position you're in and if you're moving from one position to another it's having a hard time maintaining um blood pressure all over your body and so that's when you can easily fall.

PATIENT M903
Oh.

DOCTOR M903
Okay right, cause there was one fall when you were like this, you came back up and then.

SECOND PERSON M903
He go back.

DOCTOR M903
And then you'd go this way right?

SECOND PERSON M903
@@@ do that.

DOCTOR M903
So you know.

SECOND PERSON M903
No more reaching for the bag.

PATIENT M903
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON M903
And you leaning this way, you know falling over.

DOCTOR M903
Absolutely.

SECOND PERSON M903
But then he got up and went back then he fell back.

DOCTOR M903
Backwards yeah.

SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M903
Yeah.  Parkinson's huh?

DOCTOR M903
Yeah.  Similar to it yeah.  Like we can't confirm that yet until you go to the neurologist but that's what this other doctor is thinking that it's a Parkinson's like type syndrome.  I will give you some information about that before you leave today.

PATIENT M903
Okay.

DOCTOR M903
Um so I know those were the big things on your mind.

SECOND PERSON M903
We can deal with that.

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

SECOND PERSON M903
@@@.

DOCTOR M903
Very.

SECOND PERSON M903
Give it all.

DOCTOR M903
That's all I've got for you now.

SECOND PERSON M903
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR M903
We will know more once we see the brain doctor.  He's the guy who's gonna be able to really um give us the sense of what's going on.

SECOND PERSON M903
And that's why he be having the shakes like that?

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.  All of it is tied together.

SECOND PERSON M903
Cause sometimes he can just shake, shake, shake.

PATIENT M903
Yeah one night I was shaking so bad it was terrible.

DOCTOR M903
Do you guys remember Michael J. Fox?

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M903
That's what he's got Parkinson's?

DOCTOR M903
He has Parkinson's.

SECOND PERSON M903
Right and Cassius Clay.

PATIENT M903
Cassius Clay don't have Parkinson's does he?

SECOND PERSON M903
Yes he do uh what's his name?

PATIENT M903
Mohammed Ali.

DOCTOR M903
Mohammad Ali.

SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah I called him Cassius Clay but yeah he has it.

PATIENT M903
Hmm.  That a rich folks disease huh?

SECOND PERSON M903
No @@@.

DOCTOR M903
So um I want you to know though I'm giving you information for Parkinson's disease but that's not exactly what you might have.

SECOND PERSON M903
That's not what he has.

DOCTOR M903
Because you know with anything you know whether its lung disease or heart disease there's always you know a couple of different options.  Everything's just a little bit different than the other one but I'm just giving you sort of the basic gist.

SECOND PERSON M903
Yes, uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
And then as we continue to sort of work with the neurologist we'll have a much better idea okay.  So I will print this uh, I'll do that before we leave today.  Let's talk about a couple other things.

SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
Um alright.  Any chest pain recently?

PATIENT M903
No.

DOCTOR M903
Okay good.  And how about pain in your legs?

PATIENT M903
I've had a little just today.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M903

SECOND PERSON M903
You didn't walk far away just from downstairs and the car.

DOCTOR M903
Where in your legs are you having it?

PATIENT M903
In the mid-calf.

DOCTOR M903
In the mid-calf, just one?  Right up there?

PATIENT M903
Right, right up here, just one leg.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

SECOND PERSON M903
And then cause he's not used to walking up two flights on the second floor now, he used to be on the first floor, which we gonna be back there in about a month.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

SECOND PERSON M903
You know but we be walking up two flights of stairs.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

SECOND PERSON M903
So that gets to me sometimes.

DOCTOR M903
Absolutely.  Where do you find, do you find that your legs hurt by the time you're on the second flight of stairs or not really?

PATIENT M903
No they don't usually hurt when I'm going up stairs.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

PATIENT M903
I have fallen back also.

SECOND PERSON M903
He still be, he still be clumsy cause I have to be behind him.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

DOCTOR M903

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
I think that will be great.

SECOND PERSON M903

DOCTOR M903

DOCTOR M903
Any problems with uh feeling like you haven't finished um that you still have urine but you're not able to completely empty?  No.

PATIENT M903
Uh uh.

DOCTOR M903
No? Alright.  Your blood pressure looks good today so we'll go ahead and not change anything in terms of your blood pressure medications.

PATIENT M903
Okay.

DOCTOR M903
Um let's see.

PATIENT M903
Now then the metoprolol.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M903
I stopped taking it during the day.

DOCTOR M903
You have?

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
How come?

PATIENT M903
Cause it was making me sleepy and tired all the time.

DOCTOR M903
Why did you feel like it was the metoprolol versus all the other things?

PATIENT M903
My sister told me that's what it was.

DOCTOR M903
Oh.

SECOND PERSON M903
Who you told you that?

PATIENT M903
NAME.

SECOND PERSON M903
How does only one person know your medicine?

PATIENT M903
I don't take that one in the morning but I do take it at night.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

PATIENT M903
That was the I was taking twice a day.

SECOND PERSON M903
But you still be tired anyway so.

PATIENT M903
But with this pill I be exhausted.

SECOND PERSON M903
But baby you don't do nothing.

PATIENT M903
I know.

SECOND PERSON M903
So take it!

PATIENT M903
No I don't want to take it.

DOCTOR M903
Um.

SECOND PERSON M903
He just want to get off those pills.

PATIENT M903
I do.

SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah I know but you getting ready to take more now.

PATIENT M903
Well shit.

SECOND PERSON M903
More pills now okay.

DOCTOR M903
Well I don't know if it's for your blood pressure, let me just make sure.

PATIENT M903
I thinks the metoprolol is.

DOCTOR M903
It could also be used for your heart rate so I just need to check one thing, going back in time.  Okay so we're fine.  If you really feel that way and looking at your heart rate, if you haven't taken it this morning then that's fine.  I'm okay with you holding off on the metoprolol.

PATIENT M903
I haven’t been taking it for the month.

DOCTOR M903
Okay you haven't taken it okay.

PATIENT M903
At least for the entire month.

DOCTOR M903
Alright so we'll say um, I'm gonna have to figure out how to reduce your metoprolol but maybe we can cut back on the dose okay.  Because it is a medication you're supposed to be taking twice a day.  It doesn't work.

SECOND PERSON M903
But he don't take it.

DOCTOR M903
But you know what we could do.

SECOND PERSON M903
Oh yeah, I know you told me that but I didn't know you had stopped taking it.

DOCTOR M903
Yeah I'll have to.

PATIENT M903
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
So we'll have to figure that part out.

SECOND PERSON M903
You better believe the MD.

PATIENT M903
She's telling me what it was she said I used it the other way.

SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah but still people die of resistance.

PATIENT M903
I know.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.  I don't know that the metoprolol is really contributing to your feelings of fatigue but um we'll see what we can do to try to.

SECOND PERSON M903
He still hasn't changed.  He still be in the bed all the time and he be constantly be tired but.

PATIENT M903
Yeah but I don't be sleeping.

SECOND PERSON M903
You don't be sleeping.

PATIENT M903
No.

SECOND PERSON M903
You don't be sleeping at night, so like you said.

PATIENT M903
I know.

SECOND PERSON M903
So what are you saying?  You want to be @@@.

PATIENT M903
I don't know.

SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
Let's just see for a second here.  Your last CBC, maybe you're anemic.

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
You're a little bit anemic at 12.7 but that's barely, I mean that's just a little bit lower than what we would think um.

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
Um your MCV looks fine.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON M903
I wish my doctor would do that @@@, she's good.

DOCTOR M903
And your iron levels were fine, too, the last time I checked because I did check um because you were just a little bit anemic we wanted to make sure that you were okay, so I don't think it's that in terms of what's making you fatigued.  Um it could be Parkinson's.  Are you eating alright?

PATIENT M903
Hell yes.

DOCTOR M903
Are you having any problems sleeping at night?  Does he snore at night?

SECOND PERSON M903
He do have a problem with sleeping but then when he do sleep he be like @@@.  He be like talking and @@@.

DOCTOR M903
So he doesn't sleep very restful.

SECOND PERSON M903
@@@ talking out of his head. I’ll wake him up. He'll say no, he'll be doing something like the other night, uh you were doing something with a dog or something, was it a dog or something and I said what are you doing and he said oh I'm just.  No I know what it was.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON M903
He got up and just started lighting a cigarette, so he was going like this.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON M903
Do you remember that?

PATIENT M903
Uh uh.

SECOND PERSON M903
He was doing like this and I said what'd be doing?  And he said I'm trying to light this cigarette.  I said what cigarette and then he woke up. I thought he was woke.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON M903
And he said I'm trying to light the cigarette and I said wake up and he said oh I was asleep and then in the morning I asked him and he don't even remember.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON M903
Doing it oh yeah sometimes he'll do something and I'll ask him right then and there, oh I was, he be like he won't but then the next thing I know he's snoring so he still be talking in his sleep.

DOCTOR M903
So is he snoring every night when he's sleeping?

SECOND PERSON M903
No, no.

PATIENT M903
No.

SECOND PERSON M903
You know he may be but he don't take his dentures out his mouth.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

SECOND PERSON M903
So his tongue be like this so I think he would snore.

DOCTOR M903
Do you think he’s snoring?  Cause it could be that you're not sleeping well at night and that's why um you feel a lot of daytime sleepiness.  So there's a test.

SECOND PERSON M903
But he don't sleep that much so he can't sleep.

PATIENT M903
I can't sleep during the daytime.

SECOND PERSON M903
He be taking naps but he don't know he be taking naps.  He don't go @@@.

DOCTOR M903
So that kind of sounds like somebody who's not sleeping very well at night um.

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
Um so I think what we can do is um we can do a test called a sleep study when you come here for a night and they monitor how you sleep.

SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
And if they find that you have um difficulty or you're snoring a lot, they can give you a machine that allows you to sleep better at night called a CPAP machine.

SECOND PERSON M903
But he don't snore like this.

PATIENT M903
No.

DOCTOR M903
You don't think so; you don't think this is a problem?

SECOND PERSON M903
No he was telling me he was just saying he'll tell me that he didn't go to sleep until about 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.

DOCTOR M903
So you're not sleeping.

SECOND PERSON M903
But.

PATIENT M903

SECOND PERSON M903

PATIENT M903

SECOND PERSON M903

PATIENT M903
That's mostly when I'm laying down.

SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah well regardless you do have it.

PATIENT M903
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON M903
Cause I told you you had carpal tunnel.

PATIENT M903
Right.

SECOND PERSON M903
And I gave you my brace @@@

PATIENT M903
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON M903
You be going “uh huh” and you be too quick to answer.

PATIENT M903
Now my feet getting cold.

DOCTOR M903
Okay I'm sorry.  I may put you on a daily aspirin.  I'm surprised it hasn't been ordered.

PATIENT M903
I take one.

DOCTOR M903
You do?

PATIENT M903
Yeah.

DOCTOR M903
But you're buying them at the store?

PATIENT M903
Right.

DOCTOR M903
Oh okay.  So that's why I don't see them anywhere else.  I'm like I can't believe I don't have you on a daily aspirin.

PATIENT M903
I was on it before I used to get it from here.

DOCTOR M903
Okay.

PATIENT M903
Then I found out it was cheaper.

DOCTOR M903
Oh okay.  Good.

PATIENT M903
To get it at the store.

DOCTOR M903
Alright I'm glad you're doing that.  Oh I do, I see I have it on my list; it's just not on this list though.

PATIENT M903
Okay.

DOCTOR M903
For a minute there I was worried.  You're right; they are a little cool to the touch.  I just want to check this here.  Alright.  Well I would say that we have you on everything that we need to have you on in terms of your um peripheral vascular disease, you're on an aspirin.  You're taking your simvastatin right now.  I would say that if it's not getting worse um we can stick with it.  The key to this disease is basically what's happening is that we're having a build-up of cholesterol throughout your body and it's making it hard for the blood to flow.

PATIENT M903
Oh.

DOCTOR M903
So the key to this is that, it’s just like exercising.  Like if you, say if you're walking one block and you're developing that pain in the back of your leg.

PATIENT M903
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
Every day you want to walk a little bit further so today's a block, tomorrow you're gonna walk a block.

PATIENT M903
Like a half.

DOCTOR M903
Ten steps. Yeah and slowly but surely that will improve so that's the only real thing that we can do um is to try to exercise because you know as things progress then you start getting into like getting stents in your legs and things like that but anything that we can do to try to improve it on our own, is much better.

SECOND PERSON M903
So he always be tired.  We gonna start walking.

PATIENT M903
Yeah I feel very weak too when I fall.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M903
And try to get up.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M903
I have no strength.

DOCTOR M903
I think this all is related to the blood pressure issues and so I think we're definitely gonna need some guidance as well from the neurologist about how to deal with your blood pressure issues cause I don't want to be you know doing things that make it worse.

SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
So um we'll definitely get you in to see the neurologist as soon as we can okay.  And I think some of your medications are going to change depending on what they say alright.

SECOND PERSON M903
Okay.

DOCTOR M903
Give me one second, I'm gonna be right back.

PATIENT M903
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  50:24  DOCTOR IN:  67:39)

DOCTOR M903
Alright guys.

SECOND PERSON M903
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M903
So I'm sorry to keep you guys waiting here.  We had so much to discuss cause there's so much going on with you.  So I think, yeah man it's not staying up.  Um I think the big thing that um we sort of came up with is the two doctors that you're seeing are kind of the two best doctors um.

PATIENT M903

DOCTOR M903
I don't know they could be but they're the two best doctors that you need to be seeing which one is the brain doctor.

DOCTOR M903
Oh let's see okay.

SECOND PERSON M903
Now do you think uh, uh.

DOCTOR M903
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON M903
Uh the Parkinson might have something to do with his eyesight?  Because when he watch the TV, he closes this right eye up, like when he was looking at this he was closing his right eye @@@ he just using this eye and I told him you know you're straining that eye and sometime I tell him to open it up.  He opens both of them up but still he.

PATIENT M903
Go back to what I do it.

SECOND PERSON M903
Yeah he close that eye up cause he said he blurry when he have both his eyes, the right eye makes it blurry.

DOCTOR M903
Hmm.  So I would say you definitely need to mention that when you go see the eye doctor.  That's tough for me to say.  I don't recall that Parkinson's really affects your eyesight.

SECOND PERSON M903
Let's see oh this one's on the 17th.  This the one we go to upstairs right?
