PATIENT J058
@@@.

SECOND PERSON J058
There were more reasons that we rescheduled it, that appointment.

DOCTOR J058
Okay and you were supposed to, in June, I think it was June when you saw them?

PATIENT J058
Perhaps uh. It’s been awhile.

DOCTOR J058
Well I see one from January @@@ in June.  When was the last CT scan of his chest?

SECOND PERSON J058
Probably uh, it should be uh prior to that to the oncology examination.  

DOCTOR J058
Okay.

SECOND PERSON J058
See what happened is he came from Florida.

DOCTOR J058
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON J058
From a nursing home and uh they uh he didn't bring any records with him and so they asked me to go and see if I could happen to @@@ because they wanted to uh, some information about what really happened.

DOCTOR J058
Sure.

SECOND PERSON J058
With that and so it took me a while to get that information and when I found that, I got the information for the actual treatment that he took for his lung cancer.

DOCTOR J058
Okay.

SECOND PERSON J058
And but I think @@@, well everything's fine, they concluded @@@ or follow-up and then the CT @@@.

DOCTOR J058

PATIENT J058
No.

DOCTOR J058
Okay and you took your blood pressure medicine this morning?

PATIENT J058
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON J058
Uh let me, if I may, uh we are doing vascular exercises.

DOCTOR J058
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON J058
He just started that uh two weeks ago.

DOCTOR J058
Okay.

SECOND PERSON J058
That might be the reason why his blood pressure is dropping because he's been on this medication @@@ for a while but we just recently started this exercise.

DOCTOR J058
Okay.

SECOND PERSON J058
So that might be suppressing his blood pressure because he's just never been on exercise before.

DOCTOR J058
Okay.  Yeah I mean it is low.

SECOND PERSON J058
Yeah.

DOCTOR J058
But the fact that he's not having any symptoms kind of makes me less worried.

SECOND PERSON J058
Yeah.

DOCTOR J058
Cause your blood pressure can drop for many reasons but if you're not having symptoms from it you know, if you're having infection, you're not drinking enough fluids, you're eating and drinking okay.

PATIENT J058
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J058
