DOCTOR J333
Hi.

PATIENT J333  
She's giving her sister directions.  So DOCTOR how have you been?

DOCTOR J333
I've been good, how have you been?

PATIENT J333
Well you know.  I'm fighting the after effects.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.  So everything, what’s the thing that’s bothering, what other things have been bothering you?

PATIENT J333
What about the esophagus you know.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
And it feels like heartburn when I eat something like that but uh.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
And this lousy little cough I got.  

DOCTOR J333
Alright, so.

PATIENT J333
Donna.

DOCTOR J333
Anything from the heartburn, is anything helping you?  Do we have you on any coating?

PATIENT J333
They gave me that three in one thing, that pink stuff.

SECOND PERSON J333
Hello doctor.

DOCTOR J333
Oh hi, how you doing?

PATIENT J333
It's okay but it doesn't last you know.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
It's quick dissolving like.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.  I think a viscus lidocaine that might help and you're completely done with the radiation and at this point you have had the chemo.

PATIENT J333
Everything is done.

DOCTOR J333
And they're going to do a CAT scan in a couple months.

PATIENT J333
In three months, yeah a couple months.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

PATIENT J333
They couldn't find anything, everything is gone.

DOCTOR J333
Great.

PATIENT J333
Yeah, God almighty yeah.

DOCTOR J333
You know it's been a.

PATIENT J333
Tough fight.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah it has, especially with that pneumonia and everything.

PATIENT J333
Yeah.  I'd like you to go through and see if there are some of those medications I could stop taking.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

PATIENT J333
You know there's so many of them.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
I'm losing track.

DOCTOR J333
Oh I know.  Alright so, let's see.  So you need the magnesium cause it's been low.

PATIENT J333
Definitely so.

DOCTOR J333
I think might be low because of the chemo.  Um and then you're on this Neutra-Phos which is the packet.

PATIENT J333
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J333
So I think that's okay.  Um your cough syrup.

PATIENT J333
I gotta have that.

DOCTOR J333
We'll continue that.  Tramadol are you taking that at all?

SECOND PERSON J333
That's for the pain, not at all now.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

PATIENT J333
No.

DOCTOR J333
Um okay, get rid of that.  Albuterol inhaler, that inhaler has that been helping at all?

PATIENT J333
For what, what is that for?

DOCTOR J333
Like the puffer you take.

PATIENT J333
Oh I haven't been using that.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah has it ever helped you?  Alright we can get rid of it.

PATIENT J333
No.

DOCTOR J333
Uh you know I remember.  It's one of those things it's not going to hurt, but it doesn't sound like it's doing anything for you.  Uh the omeprazole or Prilosec?

PATIENT J333
Prilosec I need it.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah, you need that.  Uh okay, are you still taking the, there's some of these chemo medications they gave you the prochlorperazine for nausea.

PATIENT J333
I didn't have any nausea on it.

SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah you had some in the beginning.

PATIENT J333
Just in the beginning.

SECOND PERSON J333
You know what that actually made him more nauseous.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

SECOND PERSON J333
You was taking that remember?

PATIENT J333
Yeah I know.

SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
I'd take it before I'd eat and before I could eat I was throwing it up.

DOCTOR J333
Okay, atenolol?

PATIENT J333
Yeah I have to have that.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah blood pressure.  So Lasix?

PATIENT J333
What is that?

DOCTOR J333
That's uh furosemide, it's a water pill.

SECOND PERSON J333
Oh he's not taking it right now.  The doctors told him to stop it.

PATIENT J333
To stop it.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.  Uh the Colace or Docusate for stools, for constipation?

PATIENT J333
No I need help there.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

PATIENT J333
Those are not working.

DOCTOR J333
Okay so you need something stronger.

SECOND PERSON J333
But they used to work from the beginning though right?

PATIENT J333
No, no, no.  It's just the.

SECOND PERSON J333
For the very beginning they do a little bit.

PATIENT J333
Yeah the first time I took them, I thought oh this is great, but it didn't happen, it didn't happen again.

DOCTOR J333
@@@ and then do you need any of these uh dressings and things?  They pulled the PICC line out right?

SECOND PERSON J333
Yes they did that.

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
So you don't need any of these alcohol.

PATIENT J333
No.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

SECOND PERSON J333
Can you eliminate all this from the computer so when they give a print-out we'll have just @@@.

PATIENT J333
He's doing it now.

DOCTOR J333
@@@.

PATIENT J333
Well he'll get a print out but after he gets rid of them.

DOCTOR J333
You don't need any of this IV stuff.

SECOND PERSON J333
No.

PATIENT J333
No.

DOCTOR J333
Still on the metformin?

PATIENT J333
Yes.

DOCTOR J333
The simvastatin?

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
Flomax?

PATIENT J333
Flomax I don't know.

SECOND PERSON J333
What was that for?

DOCTOR J333
It's for trouble, if you're having trouble urinating um.

PATIENT J333
No in fact I urinate too much at night.

DOCTOR J333
Well that's the thing; you're waking up to urinate?

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
Well this is supposed to help you empty your, when you go you empty your bladder all the way.  Sometimes what happens if the prostate is big you have and it's not emptying all the way you get just kind of, you're always halfway full and you end up going all the time.

SECOND PERSON J333
And that makes you get up all the time.

PATIENT J333
But it seems like I go enough until I empty out as much as I can.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.  Uh I'll leave it on there, if you don't want it.

PATIENT J333
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR J333
For now and you could and then you're giving yourself and these are just the insulin and stuff um… the diabetes check.

PATIENT J333
Oh I want to tell you about that, remember with the glipizide.

SECOND PERSON J333
Glipizide.

DOCTOR J333
Glipizide.

PATIENT J333
Glipizide, I'm taking two pills in the morning and one in the evening.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

PATIENT J333
And that's working out beautifully.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

PATIENT J333
You know remember we were going real low.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
So a half wasn't doing it.

SECOND PERSON J333
You were right then.

PATIENT J333
Remember we tried a half and it wasn't doing.

SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
So I started a full pill and that's been working great.  In the morning I'm 109, 111.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

PATIENT J333
Right on the number.

DOCTOR J333
So 20 in the morning and 10 at night.

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
Alright and then the metformin still.

PATIENT J333
Yeah it's working.

DOCTOR J333
Alright.  Now for the stool softener uh, so you're taking the Docusate.  You want to try something, have you ever tried MiraLax?  Uh it's something you know, it's kind of something to take it's like a last resort.  So here, let me give, I'm going to give you a pill that'll keep things, will get things moving.

PATIENT J333
Okay.

DOCTOR J333
Okay so the Docusate is just a stool softener and it's not.

PATIENT J333
It's not.

DOCTOR J333
It's not a very strong one um.  Then there's a laxative called Senna which you can take in a pill form.

PATIENT J333
Okay.

DOCTOR J333
So I'm gonna give you that one and then I'm gonna also give you a prescription for MiraLax, which is if things get backed up you can take uh one of these MiraLax things and that's uh, that's to get things moving okay.

PATIENT J333
See I've been drinking prune juice.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
And that helps.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah that'll help too.

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
But uh this is you know a little bit stronger um.  I would keep doing the Colace, you can just take that every day, it'll just keep things a little moving but.

PATIENT J333
Cause I normally don't go like every three days or four days sometimes.  That's been a problem too.

SECOND PERSON J333
Eat some more prunes. @@@.

DOCTOR J333
Do you want this delivered or do you want to pick it up today?

PATIENT J333
Uh they can deliver it; I got enough stuff to keep me going.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

PATIENT J333
I got some prune juice left.

DOCTOR J333
Alright.  Then the MiraLax, polyethylene glycol is what it's called.  It'll come in these packets that you just put in a glass of water and just take that as needed for constipation.  So the cough, you know we're, there's not much else we can do for it.  I just hope that it gets a little bit better after things calm down a little bit and um if it's, you know we'll keep the cough syrup going and uh you know.  I think you know it's probably, it is probably from the mass and we know that.  I don't think it's a pneumonia.

PATIENT J333
Oh no, it's definitely that.

DOCTOR J333
And uh.

PATIENT J333
Cause there's hardly any phlegm with it.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
It's just.

DOCTOR J333
It's just irritating.

PATIENT J333
Tickling and you know.

DOCTOR J333
So I, you know I think the best thing to do is the cough syrup for that um.  I don't think DOCTOR had any further ideas.

PATIENT J333
Well she sent me what four bottles of cough syrup.

SECOND PERSON J333
Uh-huh yesterday.

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.  Does the cough syrup help?

PATIENT J333
I haven't started it yet.

DOCTOR J333
Okay, so we'll try that.

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
Um.

PATIENT J333
I got four bottles.  Don't order me anymore.

SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah, actually you know, he took it before.  But you gotta take it I guess every four hours regularly, you know for it to help.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah and it's going to be this stuff that's a little bit sedating um so you just got to watch it.  You know, don't drive with it if you're taking it you know.

SECOND PERSON J333
No.  Is it addictive doctor?  No?

DOCTOR J333
Not really um.  It's just uh, it might knock you out a little bit but there's not.

SECOND PERSON J333
@@@ okay, I had bronchitis a couple weeks ago and I took the antibiotics and all of the and I still had a bad cough you know and I started taking NyQuil at night, like a teaspoon of it before I go to bed.  So for ten nights I'm sleeping nice without waking up.

DOCTOR J333
Oh yeah.

SECOND PERSON J333
Well the one night I didn't take it, I woke up early.

DOCTOR J333
No I'm not too worried about him becoming uh.

PATIENT J333
Yeah.  And you know me when it comes to medicines.  As soon as I can stop it, I stop it.

DOCTOR J333
If you didn't need it, I mean it.

PATIENT J333
Right exactly.

SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
Right.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.  Are you taking anything for the, what are you taking for the heartburn and uh esophageal?

PATIENT J333
The syrup?

DOCTOR J333
Yeah nothing okay.

PATIENT J333
They gave me, like I say this pink stuff in this big bottle.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

PATIENT J333
But that ain't doing it.  I mean it's okay for about ten minutes or so and if I would go out to dinner or something, by the time I'm finished with my dinner it's doing nothing at all.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.  I mean I think that's all from the radiation you know.

PATIENT J333
Well that's what everybody said.

DOCTOR J333
It'll be getting better.

SECOND PERSON J333
How long does it take a year or?

DOCTOR J333
@@@.

SECOND PERSON J333
No not that long.

DOCTOR J333
Your last treatment was on when, it was about uh.

SECOND PERSON J333
Five, six weeks ago, something like.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.  Okay so you still have that bottle of pink stuff?

PATIENT J333
Yes.

DOCTOR J333
So when you go out to dinner, I mean you can take it and it'll last for about ten minutes okay um and do you have pain pills that you can take?

PATIENT J333
Yes.

SECOND PERSON J333
He has Vicodin.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah sometimes the Vicodin will help a little bit if you take it prior.

PATIENT J333
Prior.

DOCTOR J333
To meals you know and just try to kind of brace, just till it's numbed down, kind of like this.

PATIENT J333
Cause they said that can also cause the.

DOCTOR J333
Constipation.

PATIENT J333
That was funny.

SECOND PERSON J333
@@@.

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON J333
Better start eating more vegetables and fruits though.

PATIENT J333
Oh you and your vegetables.

DOCTOR J333
But I'm hoping that that should get better.  The more we move away from the radiation.  It's just lingering a little while.

PATIENT J333
But you know I can't imagine how that pain is when I start eating and it locks up there you know when I swallow.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
And it gets down to a certain point and then I could feel it like you know there.  If I try to sip some water to get it down.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
Well when the water hits it, oh it's like somebody shoved a poker down there, hot poker.

SECOND PERSON J333
Oh my God.

PATIENT J333
It's really hard and I don't know what to do with it.

DOCTOR J333
Okay.

PATIENT J333
Now it does go down.  It'll finally let go and then the pain is gone.

DOCTOR J333
Alright well let me see if I can talk to, I'll talk to some of our cancer doctors and see if there's something else that we can think of uh.

PATIENT J333
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J333
After this, um I'm actually on the Hemoc Service right now so I'll see doctors, a couple of the doctors a little later today.  I'll see if they have any other ideas of what we can do and how long we can expect this to go on.

PATIENT J333
Oh that would be nice.

DOCTOR J333
Uh I don't know if I'm, I mean I don't want to promise anything.

PATIENT J333
Oh right.

DOCTOR J333
Um and uh alright no fevers or chills or anything like that?  Uh cough is pretty much dry at this point.

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
Uh alright and uh.

PATIENT J333
I mean I'm putting on weight.  I put on a few more pounds.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
And I'm doing a lot more things that I couldn't do before.

DOCTOR J333
Okay, great.

PATIENT J333
Yeah so.

DOCTOR J333
That's the key.

PATIENT J333
So it's working out.

DOCTOR J333
Alright.

PATIENT J333
Slowly.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah so yeah, the weight is coming up a little bit.

SECOND PERSON J333
What's the weight, how much he weigh now?

DOCTOR J333
149.2, so it was 147 at the lowest.

SECOND PERSON J333
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J333
So it's starting up.

PATIENT J333
Yeah we're getting it up there.

DOCTOR J333
Alright want to just have a seat up here?

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
Give me a deep breath.  Okay, breathe normally.  Any swelling in your legs?

PATIENT J333
No.  I'm doing okay.

DOCTOR J333
Alright uh so.  I'm gonna go talk to the boss and see if they're gonna want to do this.

PATIENT J333
Okay.

DOCTOR J333
This assessment, so I'll show you where it is when I come back.

PATIENT J333
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  49:11  DOCTOR IN:  59:02)

DOCTOR J333
Alright so, do you have any antibiotics at home in case you need them?

PATIENT J333
The what?

SECOND PERSON J333
Antibiotics, we don't have any more.

DOCTOR J333
Okay, well you know if you start having fevers, chills or anything like that uh you know, if that happens.

PATIENT J333
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR J333
You're at risk for getting pneumonias okay, you understand.  Because this obstruction, that's what's causing the cough.  But sometimes if you can't clear up, you're not going to be, you know what I mean so you're at risk for getting pneumonias and you might not be able to tolerate it.

PATIENT J333
Well we just took the antibiotics for seven days.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah okay.  So the same antibiotic that you took.

SECOND PERSON J333
Well if you can give him another prescription then.

DOCTOR J333
And we still want you to, but I want you to be.  You know if you start having any fevers or chills or the cough is getting worse.  If you're just feeling like body aches or feeling sick you need to call us immediately okay and then we'll get you some antibiotics.

SECOND PERSON J333
Oh you can't prescribe him any right now?

DOCTOR J333
Well I can give it, if you want I can give you, what I can do is have them mail you a prescription, so you can have it at home and take it in case you need it.

SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah that'll be good.

DOCTOR J333
But I want you, if you do get to the point where you're gonna take them, I want you to call us yeah.

PATIENT J333
If I have to take them I'll get hold of you.

DOCTOR J333
So let us know if you end up taking the antibiotics, just in case.

PATIENT J333
So when do I get over this hump with the pneumonia?

DOCTOR J333
Well no, no I'm just saying, I don't think you have a pneumonia right now.

PATIENT J333
Oh.

SECOND PERSON J333
No but he needs the, it's when the, like when he won't be susceptible anymore.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah your lungs are, you know you have a blockage in one of them so you know the lung comes down like this you know um, breaks off a couple of different ways.

SECOND PERSON J333
And the blockage is still from the tumor right?

DOCTOR J333
Tumor and just scar.  You know we got this.

SECOND PERSON J333
The scar tissue.

DOCTOR J333
From all the radiation so you know this is kind of where the tumor was, it was in this ball park like on the right side so you got the tumor all shrunk down, so it's shriveled down but this airway here is still blocked you know partly.  So you're, you know what I'm worried about is if you get another infection you know, past this blockage, like so all the bacteria's down here, like just sits here and then you know and you're not able to clear it because it's blocked then we need to make sure you're getting the antibiotics okay.

PATIENT J333
Okay.

DOCTOR J333
But I think um oh um, but I don't think you need any now you know.

SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
You will know yourself if you're getting sick.

SECOND PERSON J333
So he should be very careful coming in contact with people that are sick.

DOCTOR J333
Well yeah I think that's uh.

PATIENT J333
But that goes for everybody.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.  Um.

SECOND PERSON J333
So wash your hands often and all that.

PATIENT J333
I do you know I always do that.

DOCTOR J333
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON J333
Yeah.

PATIENT J333
Every place I go I squirt.

DOCTOR J333
So I'm going to give you a script for that just in case you need it.

PATIENT J333
That'd be good.

DOCTOR J333
To kind of.

PATIENT J333
Cause sometimes you now you try to call and you can't get through and then.

DOCTOR J333
Oh I know, that's what.

SECOND PERSON J333
Or it's a weekend.

PATIENT J333
Yeah.

DOCTOR J333
Alright and then let's say four months or if you need something else you know you can always call for something.

PATIENT J333
