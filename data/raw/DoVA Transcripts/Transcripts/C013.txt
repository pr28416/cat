Yeah.

DOCTOR C013
Yeah so I would leave that up to your neurologist to make changes.  How are you doing?  Sometimes it can help with the tremor.  Are you having any of that?

DOCTOR C013
Oh sometimes uh, sometimes people with Parkinson.

PATIENT C013
Yeah.

DOCTOR C013
At this point can @@@ sometimes it's hard for them to turn.  It's called, we call it postural instability which means they can do fine but when you turn you have a hard time turning.

PATIENT C013
Well I said that before, my body turns but my legs don't.

DOCTOR C013
Right.

PATIENT C013
I found that to be many times.

DOCTOR C013
Yeah so I mean I think the things that we do with that is of course um uh, um physical therapy, making sure you're on the same medications and making sure you’re seeing neurologist.  It looks like you're seeing DOCTOR.  He's gonna be your new doctor um on June, June 29th.

DOCTOR C013
Uh the other thing I wanted to ask is uh.

PATIENT C013
How soon will I, how often will I see you?

DOCTOR C013
You can see me as often as you like.  I was thinking we can go every six months but if you wanted to see me sooner we can do that too.  Do you want to be seen sooner?

PATIENT C013
Well maybe.

DOCTOR C013
No.  Are you having any, are you having any thyroid symptoms?  Cause sometimes constipation could be from thyroid.

PATIENT C013
Really?

DOCTOR C013

DOCTOR C013
Are you um, you're not gaining weight.  Do you feel like your reaction is slower?  Do you feel fatigued, do you feel like you're skin is dry?  Do you feel like your hair is getting coarse or anything?

DOCTOR C013
Okay.  Your TSH is a little bit higher than before and then that's high.

PATIENT C013
How about my kidneys and liver?

DOCTOR C013
Your liver is fine.  Your kidneys I know there's a little bit of um elevated right its.

DOCTOR C013
Yeah.  @@@.  Do you want to see your GI doctor or do you want?

PATIENT C013
Well.

DOCTOR C013
I can do this, I can do both things.  I can have you see the GI doctor, the stomach doctor.

PATIENT C013
Right.

DOCTOR C013
To see if they want to take a look.  Uh in the meantime before you see them, do you want me to change your medications around do you feel @@@ difference?

PATIENT C013
No.

DOCTOR C013
No cause I can do this.

PATIENT C013
Well I'm worried about the reflux.

DOCTOR C013
That's what I'm saying I can change that around so instead of taking the omeprazole I can try to, I can increase your dose to see if it's different.

PATIENT C013
Oh really?

DOCTOR C013
Yeah I can have you do that um.

PATIENT C013
That's the pills or the liquid?

DOCTOR C013
The pill.

PATIENT C013
Alright.  Is it stronger?

DOCTOR C013
Yeah and then I can increase it, change it.

PATIENT C013
Okay.

DOCTOR C013
Or I can change this to a different pill.  Stronger, but a different pill to see if it makes a difference.

PATIENT C013
Let's try the different pill.

DOCTOR C013
You want to try the different pill, alright let's do that.

PATIENT C013
