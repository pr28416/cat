And uh that's something that's gonna affect your health in addition to, you know we're worried about your health but it being illegal we don't really care so much about but.

PATIENT P441
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR P441
But it does cause health problem so we need to try to get you off of that, cocaine.  About how frequently have you been using it?

PATIENT P441
I'd say about once or twice a week.

DOCTOR P441
And the last time I saw you was maybe December or January.

PATIENT P441
It was in November actually.

DOCTOR P441
In November, the end of November that I saw you the last time um and then when did you restart?

PATIENT P441
I started about a month ago.

DOCTOR P441
Okay so you had some time where you were able to avoid it um.

PATIENT P441
But um the program I was in was a good program cause you know it showed @@@ you know it was like bad shape @@@.  I feel better that I did you know did a program and um it was a good program and I was just, you know boredom or whatever I you know I slipped in there but I have @@@ changed @@@ after the program.  So instead of every day it's like once or twice a week you know.  That's still not good but it's slowly down over 75%.

DOCTOR P441
That's good and I think and actually to get you off of it again and keep you off of it.

PATIENT P441
Yeah.

DOCTOR P441
So hopefully working with them again will hopefully get you there um.  

PATIENT P441
Laughing to myself, you know, the me, myself and I. The eyes don't lie you know.

DOCTOR P441
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P441
And @@@.

DOCTOR P441
@@@.

PATIENT P441
It was the eyes.  Uh really because you're a doctor though, come on man.

DOCTOR P441
Uh you know uh we want what's best for you.

PATIENT P441
Yes.

DOCTOR P441
And to do that we need to know the truth and even if you say, even if you don't do what we tell you, we want to know about it.

PATIENT P441
Right.

DOCTOR P441
Make sure that we can do everything we can.

PATIENT P441
Right, right.

DOCTOR P441
Your care so.  We uh, we're not here to pass any judgment.

PATIENT P441
Right.

DOCTOR P441
We'll just give you advice.  That's what we do.  We'll give you advice and if you take it that's great.

PATIENT P441
I appreciate the whole VA System and everything like that but um I mean the friends of mine, they don't have, they don't have the options that I have.

DOCTOR P441
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P441
So.  Um I've been @@@ since 86 and actually this is the first time I've been using it, the program.  I had a tooth pulled back in '91 but aside that I don't know, I @@@.  I wish I knew more about it then. 

DOCTOR P441
Uh let's see.  So it looks like uh you never got the colonoscopy, it looks like.

PATIENT P441
No sir.

DOCTOR P441
Um is that something you wanted to do now or do you want to hold off for now?

PATIENT P441
I'd be willing to do that.

DOCTOR P441
Alright we'll put it back in.

PATIENT P441
Is that recommended or?

DOCTOR P441
Yeah so the reason we do it is because um, once you get above 50 your risk of colon cancer is increased and uh this is the way we can see it early, treat it.  Sometimes it's something small, which usually it is, if we see you regularly they can just take it out and then that'll be the end of it.  Um whereas if it becomes something that we miss um you know maybe you'd be able to go for you know maybe you wouldn't get it during your lifetime and wouldn't have any problems but it you would then it would become advanced and then that causes more problems and it's been shown to be effective in taking care of it early on.  Uh can I take a look at your feet?  Take your shoes and socks off.  Set things up.

PATIENT P441
I've got the pain right here.  

DOCTOR P441
Okay.  Where is the pain mostly in the morning?

PATIENT P441
On most of the morning, it's right here.

DOCTOR P441
Oh through there.

PATIENT P441
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P441
Okay.  Um I'm going to poke you with this, see if you can feel it.

PATIENT P441
I feel like a tapping.

DOCTOR P441

PATIENT P441
