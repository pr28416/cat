DOCTOR V773
Yep.

PATIENT V773

A new one, every year I come here I get a new doctor.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah, sorry about that.  I'm going to stay uh.  @@@.  My name is @@@.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
I'm one of the residents here um.  I'm going to stay for three years so.

PATIENT V773
Oh well I have you a couple more years then huh.

DOCTOR V773
So, I'll be seeing you a few more times if you come in every year.  Um okay so PATIENT I looked at the chart.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
So that I'll tell you what I know so far.  Uh I see you have hypertension and you have some high sugars; otherwise you're doing fine basically.  Your weight is a little; you're overweight so I think we're working on the weight.  Um yeah so that's all I know so far.

PATIENT V773
Well this I got from my foot doctor okay.  Every, I don't know four, five, six months I get a little flare-up on the gout.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
And I'm going down to Florida.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
In another couple of months but I don't want to go down without my medicine.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
So I went to her to get the prescription renewed.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
Just so when I get down there I don't have to hunt around for a doctor if I have a flare.

DOCTOR V773
Okay sure.

PATIENT V773
And you know try and get the medicine and uh right off she told me to give this to my doc when I go there for my physical and I don't know what, I didn't read it.

DOCTOR V773
Oh so this is the lab.

PATIENT V773
This uh.

DOCTOR V773
It's uh January.

PATIENT V773
7 uh yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Recent lab.

PATIENT V773
Yeah I just went in January.

DOCTOR V773
Okay so that's, okay.

PATIENT V773
Anyway and then last time I was here.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
They said my blood pressure was a little bit high so they give me one of these light sort of things and they said to keep track of it.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
Okay so this morning when I took it, it was 125/68.

DOCTOR V773
Oh great, you have book here?

PATIENT V773
Oh yeah I got a plan.

DOCTOR V773
Awesome thank you.

PATIENT V773
It's high and then it goes low and then they put me on different pills and that doesn't work.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah it's generally high I would say.  You decided not to take it too much?

PATIENT V773
No I been taking the same thing.  They keep giving me different pills to take.

DOCTOR V773
What pill are you taking right now?

PATIENT V773
I'm taking three of them.

DOCTOR V773
Okay let me ask which ones.

PATIENT V773
Well lisinopril here I'll find them.

DOCTOR V773
Lisinopril 20 mg?

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Every day?

PATIENT V773
Every day I take all three of them in the morning.

DOCTOR V773
And then you take thiazide 25 mg.

PATIENT V773
Uh yep.

DOCTOR V773
Okay and amlodipine 10 mg.

PATIENT V773
Yeah I cut the pill in half.  That one I cut in half.  The 25 uh.

DOCTOR V773
The @@@ you cut it in half right?

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.  So your blood pressure is still high a little bit today so.

PATIENT V773
Yeah but it'll go high just driving over here thinking about coming to this place.

DOCTOR V773
I know, I know.  So what I am going to do is I'm going to check on my own and check another one.

PATIENT V773
Let me ask you something.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah.

PATIENT V773
Instead of keep, see every doctor I used to get, see I come back here once a year for my physical so every new doctor I get wants to change things.

DOCTOR V773
Right.

PATIENT V773
Now the first time I went here, when I go back to 2006 when I first started coming here.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
My blood pressure's just a little bit high.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
I got one pill, works fine and I come in the next year, I got a new doctor, now he says well let's try this, well let's try that, let's tweak this, let's tweak that.  Now he's got me taking two pills.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
The next year I come in, now he's got me taking three pills.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah.

PATIENT V773
You know, I don't understand what the hell is going on here to be honest with you.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
So like I say everybody wants to change everything.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
You know the old concern if it ain't broke don't fix it.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
Why did they begin changing my medicine to begin with?

DOCTOR V773
Okay.  So, it's not because they want to change them or anything.  If they don't need to change them I think they won't change.  So basically your blood pressure when you come in.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
It's uncontrolled.

PATIENT V773
Right.

DOCTOR V773
So what that means um and although we add all the medication your blood pressure is not controlled.  So that means your blood pressure has worsened.  Though I think it's in the same range, we're adding the medication and you're still high, that means it's worsening.  That's why they added.

PATIENT V773
My blood pressure gets high just looking for a place to park out here.

DOCTOR V773
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V773
I'm serious.  I mean it's just.  You drive around trying to find a place to park and you can't find a place to park.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah and then you get angry @@@.

PATIENT V773
You know and I say Jesus Christ.

DOCTOR V773
I know what you're saying.

PATIENT V773
That's uh, I don't know I guess.

DOCTOR V773
I know what you're saying sir.  Okay.

PATIENT V773
Well I guess what I'm asking can they condense everything into one pill?

DOCTOR V773
No.

PATIENT V773
No.

DOCTOR V773
They got you on good medications.  If we can do that, we like to do that.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
But no, that's not possible.

PATIENT V773
Okay.

DOCTOR V773
There are some combination pills.  Like two of the drugs you are taking.  There's a combination pill that will have both of them.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
But if you're on a good dose, um you need to take three pills and it's not until you get a @@@ dose that we know that this is the right dose.  We can't titrate it if it's a combination pill, so we can't go up on one and we can't go up on one so usually we like to use um like single dose, single medication pills.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Until we get a good control okay.  And then what I'm seeing right now is that if.

PATIENT V773
See I can go home and I can do it in another couple hours and take my own blood pressure with the.

DOCTOR V773
Right.

PATIENT V773
Machine they gave me and it'd be normal.

DOCTOR V773
Do you the normal range of the blood pressure?

PATIENT V773
Yeah they tell me they wanted to keep it down around 140 or below.

DOCTOR V773
Right.

PATIENT V773
It’s those I get when I'm at home.

DOCTOR V773
Well okay, so today your blood pressure initially when we checked was 156 alright and then it came down to 148 when we took again.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
So I'm going to take it again.

PATIENT V773
Okay.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
It's probably high now.

DOCTOR V773
Let me see.

PATIENT V773
Let me take off my shirt.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.  Do you exercise?  

PATIENT V773
Do I exercise?  Not really.

DOCTOR V773
Not really.  So exercise.

PATIENT V773
This morning I was out shoveling.

DOCTOR V773
Exercises are good for blood pressure.

PATIENT V773
I take a walk every day.  So I walk down, I get my.

DOCTOR V773
About how long do you walk?

PATIENT V773
20 minutes maybe.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah that's good.  Every day?

PATIENT V773
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Oh that's good.

PATIENT V773
I walk down and get the paper and oh I still work part-time on and off.

DOCTOR V773
So if you could put your arms here good.  Just relax.  It is 140/65, a little better.

PATIENT V773
Going down.

DOCTOR V773
Yes sir.

PATIENT V773
@@@.

DOCTOR V773
So.

PATIENT V773
I just gotta calm myself down.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah, try to calm down.  Part of it could be diet and then you exercise 20 minutes a day.

PATIENT V773
Yeah like I say I go out for a walk every morning.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.  So and who do you live with?

PATIENT V773
Pardon?

DOCTOR V773
Who do you live with?

PATIENT V773
My son.

DOCTOR V773
Your son and uh do you have any family members who have had significant medical problems before?

PATIENT V773
No.

DOCTOR V773
Stroke, early heart attack, cancer?  Good and you have no allergies to medications?

PATIENT V773
Nope.

DOCTOR V773
And these three are the only medications you're taking right now?

PATIENT V773
That's it.  The only other one, like I say if I get a little flare-up of the gout.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
I take the.

DOCTOR V773
When did you get the flare-up last time?

PATIENT V773
Oh it's been a few months.  It's uh probably been four or five months.

DOCTOR V773
Okay and uh.

PATIENT V773
Like I say, you know I could go along.

DOCTOR V773
Where do you get the pain?

PATIENT V773
On the gout?

DOCTOR V773
Yeah.

PATIENT V773
Usually around my ankle you know.  I did get it once in my elbow.

DOCTOR V773
The ankle or elbow okay and then how many times of flare-ups did you have so far in your life?

PATIENT V773
In my life since I've, oh I don't know.

DOCTOR V773
A lot?

PATIENT V773
No, no.  Like I say.

DOCTOR V773
More than 10?

PATIENT V773
No.

DOCTOR V773
About 5?

PATIENT V773
Yeah probably around five.

DOCTOR V773
Okay and uh for the last approximately one year, how many times did you have a flare-up?

PATIENT V773
Last year, I'd say once.

DOCTOR V773
Once okay alright.

PATIENT V773
Like I say and the only reason, I don't know again, without having the bottle with me.  I don't know what, she wrote down what I got on here.

DOCTOR V773
Uh-huh, okay.

PATIENT V773
Uh.  I don't know if she wrote it down there, wouldn't know if I seen it anyway.  But it's a little blue-greenish pills.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
You know and like I say, if I get it right away, if I feel it coming and I get it right away.

DOCTOR V773
It goes uh, goes away.

PATIENT V773
I take a couple of these pills.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah.

PATIENT V773
Before I go to bed or during the day.

DOCTOR V773
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V773
Then I take a couple you know.  I take maybe four of them.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
And it's usually gone overnight.

DOCTOR V773
And uh when you took the blood pressure today, did you eat this morning, you didn't eat yet this morning?

PATIENT V773
I haven't eaten nothing since last night.  They told me to fast.

DOCTOR V773
Okay thank you so much.  So for the next time when you come um you can fast and then before you see me.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
You can get labs that's fine.

PATIENT V773
Oh okay.

DOCTOR V773
I need the blood pressure readings okay.

PATIENT V773
Yeah they said I needed blood so don't eat nothing after midnight.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah.

PATIENT V773
So.

DOCTOR V773
So that's, you know I'm sorry about that.  We have to do that when we do your cholesterol level.

PATIENT V773
Oh that's no big deal.

DOCTOR V773
But um you can eat lunch after you leave okay.

PATIENT V773
Alright.

DOCTOR V773
After we do blood tests.  So it's just for little blood test, it's not to see me.  Okay um and that's, that.  Your lipid levels look fine.  You're not taking any medication and this level is very good. Um your sugar is a little on the high side, that will cause diabetes okay.

PATIENT V773
How high is high?

DOCTOR V773
So your sugar is, you didn't eat anything and your sugar was 125, blood sugar.

PATIENT V773
What's normal?

DOCTOR V773
So normal if you're fasting I would see around under 100.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
So that means you have a little bit of resistance to the insulin that you give for the sugar so that means that I would say pre-diabetic.  So if you continue to be, continue this lifestyle or to continue the same foods, uh soon you'll become diabetic.  So as your primary care doctor I would like prevent that.

PATIENT V773
So what do you got to do, lay off the sweets?

DOCTOR V773
Yeah definitely.  So no sweets um pop, do you drink a lot of pop?

PATIENT V773
No I don't drink pop.

DOCTOR V773
How about cola or coke?

PATIENT V773
No.  I don't drink much pop.  Well once in a great while I'll have a pop.  Mostly, I've been drinking a little of that flavored water.

DOCTOR V773
Oh okay.

PATIENT V773
I drink a lot of water.

DOCTOR V773
Okay that sounds good, that's not too bad.

PATIENT V773
Uh.

DOCTOR V773
Um but do you?

PATIENT V773
Once in a while Gatorade.

DOCTOR V773
Gatorade um, just once in a while is fine um.  Do you eat a lot of sweet stuff like um I don't know cookies or?

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
So that's definitely something you cut down on.  If you can do that, do you eat it every day?

PATIENT V773
No not every day.

DOCTOR V773
So once every few days?

PATIENT V773
Yeah you know once every few days I.

DOCTOR V773
Okay well if you could reduce that to once every week and uh what kind of foods do you have?  Do you eat a lot of meats and stuff or?

PATIENT V773
Well yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Hamburgers?

PATIENT V773
Hamburger.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah, so if you could stop, I mean reduce the, I don't think you can stop it but if you can reduce the amounts maybe you can eat some fish for a change, eat some more vegetables, eat some more fruit, those kinds of diet is something you want to follow.

PATIENT V773
No candy huh?

DOCTOR V773
No candy, no candy, no candy and then.

PATIENT V773
How about peanuts or something like that or?

DOCTOR V773
Peanuts are good but um, if you eat too much peanuts, they're very salty.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
And that raises your blood pressure.  You have two things, you have to eat @@@ salt and you have to watch out for sugar.  So the salty stuff is like potato chips, um if you eat chips with hamburgers.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Hamburgers can have a lot of salt in there um, uh let's see, let's see, what else do you eat, I can't think of the salty stuff.

PATIENT V773
Uh I don't know.  I do put salt on some stuff.  I don't put a lot but just enough to flavor it a little bit.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah.  So don't put salt.

PATIENT V773
Don't put salt.

DOCTOR V773
Or just put a little bit.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Because that kind of thing can make your blood pressure @@@ definitely.

PATIENT V773
Yeah, okay.

DOCTOR V773
Okay and what I see from the blood test is I'd say you're pre-diabetic.  You're not diabetic but your.

PATIENT V773
I'm borderline?

DOCTOR V773
Borderline, you're borderline.  You're getting to it.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
And we want to prevent that and uh your kidney function has been a little higher than normal person.  I think you know that?

PATIENT V773
Yeah well @@@.

DOCTOR V773
Something called creatinine; we measure it to see your kidney functions.

PATIENT V773
Through my blood?

DOCTOR V773
Yeah through your blood.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
And that's been a little high but and it @@@.  That's most likely caused by hypertension in your case.  Usually the two major things that cause kidney issues.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
Is hypertension and diabetes okay and in your case you're not diabetic.  A lot of diabetes people they go onto dialysis, you know that right?

PATIENT V773
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR V773
So initially we start seeing like a mild elevation of the kidney function, that's the first sign that we're injuring the kidneys and you're having that sign.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
Okay and then the next thing you see is that you start leak some protein from the kidney and those are the bad signs that your kidney's not doing well.  Um your urine test you had today actually showed a little bit of protein so this is not good as well.  So but those things all come down to the um the same things, is good don't be diabetic and have your blood pressure in good control so that's the main kinds of treatment.

PATIENT V773
Alright.

DOCTOR V773
So that's why we were worried about your blood pressure.  If the blood pressure runs high all the time that can injury your kidney okay.

PATIENT V773
Okay.  So in other words now, I'm still on the same medication right?

DOCTOR V773
You're still on the same medications but I would say um, so keep away from salt definitely because that will raise your um blood pressure.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
And as I said exercise helps.  So if you're walking 20 minutes that's great.  Maybe you can do 30 minutes a day um, yeah I think those things would help and then if you're stressed out, as you said the blood pressure can rise.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
So stay away from stressors and uh have a good sleep, have a good sleep and good cycle of your life.

PATIENT V773
Good health.

DOCTOR V773
So I'd say, I recommend that.  Um your blood pressure is borderline high so if I see it, I would like to have it lower than this.  Uh normal range would be 140 and uh 140 is the systolic and the 90 is the diastolic but for people who are having some kidney issues, I would like to have it a little more lower.  So in your case I would like to aim a little lower.  So if I, I didn't know that you were upset about getting all the medication increased.

PATIENT V773
Oh know I was just curious because as I say every time I come in.

DOCTOR V773
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V773
I have a different doctor and he'd want to say well let's tweak this or let's tweak that and.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah.

PATIENT V773
You know and I think well shit now I started out on one pill, now I'm on three pills.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah, that's not because they want to tweak it, it's because it's getting worse okay.  So we have to do something for that.  Let's see.  So the thiazide, I think we can go up.  So you're taking only half a pill of the thiazide right?

PATIENT V773
The little orange one?

DOCTOR V773
The orange one yeah.

PATIENT V773
Yeah I tell you that's the one I'm cutting in half.  Yeah I take a half a pill.

DOCTOR V773
So let's see, amlodipine you're maxed out.  Lisinopril you're not maxed out.  So we can either increase this one or this one.  Uh I think since you're cutting the pill in half, you can just take that whole pill every day.

PATIENT V773
Just take the whole pill of it.

DOCTOR V773
A whole pill every day and then since you're telling me that your blood pressure is high when you come into the hospital, I would like to have it checked for the next two weeks if you don't mind and could you come to the hospital to see my nurse so that we can recheck your blood pressure?

PATIENT V773
It'll be high.

DOCTOR V773
Oh you think it'll be high?

PATIENT V773
Just coming over here yeah, I start thinking about it and uh.

DOCTOR V773
Or you know you can check at home for two weeks and then show me the records that you have two weeks and we won't check here.

PATIENT V773
Alright, well like I say it's uh.  I don't care if they check it here and every time I come in here it's, like I say I checked it this morning and it was 126.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah because I see here, I see that you've been running high for me too.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Right so probably if we take the average you're on the high side.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
So at home.  So I think that we will increase the medication if you don't mind.

PATIENT V773
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.  

PATIENT V773
Whatever.

DOCTOR V773
Alright so, so uh let's see.  I think we can definitely increase this one and then I'm thinking of increasing this one was well.

PATIENT V773
Which one is that?

DOCTOR V773
The lisinopril.

PATIENT V773
The lisinopril okay.

DOCTOR V773
So you can go up to 80 mg of lisinopril and then you can go up to 25 mg on the thiazide those are all maximum dose.  So and then um let's see and then you can come and see us in a month.

PATIENT V773
Alright.

DOCTOR V773
Is that okay?

PATIENT V773
Yes.

DOCTOR V773
And uh you can, I don't know, you don't have to see me necessarily so you can just log in your blood pressure and you can come to see my nurse and then you can hand in the log that you have.

PATIENT V773
Yeah, well this one's full so, I'll have to keep checking on it.

DOCTOR V773
Right, usually do it for a time.

PATIENT V773
Alright.

DOCTOR V773
So if you could give us a copy so that we can um uh, we can leave it in the hospital, one sheet of paper at the hospital that'd be.

PATIENT V773
Yeah okay yeah.

DOCTOR V773
That'd be easier for us.

PATIENT V773
Keep a copy of it.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah just in case so that we can, if I get that paper, I'll just put that into the computer so we can know where the blood pressure is running.

PATIENT V773
Alright.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.  So let's do that in one month.  Um and your blood pressure issue is okay and then the other thing I wanted to ask was, you had a flu shot, your shots are up-to-date.

PATIENT V773
Well I was gonna stop and get a flu shot on the way out of here.

DOCTOR V773
Oh yeah, you have that to do, you have a flu shot this year.  So you're going to get a flu shot today and then, how's your colonoscopy?  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT V773
No.

DOCTOR V773
Oh never?  So how old are, you're 58.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
So probably you should have one.  Like everybody over 50 it is recommended.

PATIENT V773
Yeah I know and the last, you know I asked the doctor a couple years ago.  I had a little woman doctor.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
And she says you know I says I just don't really think about having one but she says you know if you get blood in your stool with a lot of blood or if it's black.

DOCTOR V773
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V773
And it hasn't been black and I don't, I haven't had any blood in my stools so.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.  So, but even if you don't have blood in your stools uh, everybody over 50 is recommended to do a scope.

PATIENT V773
Well I'm not really interested in having one right now.

DOCTOR V773
So the reason for this colonoscopy, colonoscopy is basically a camera.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
That goes in through the rectum.

PATIENT V773
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR V773
Okay so they're going to give you some sedation.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
So that it won't be too painful.  The reason we do this is because you know that colon cancer is very prevalent in the United States, especially people who eat like American diets, high fatty foods and colon cancer, how it starts is like one small polyp, it starts with one small polyp and then as time goes, you know it grows, grows, grows and then it invades.  Invades, so if there's a colon here, it starts out like a tiny polyp.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
And then as time goes it grows, it grows okay and then it grows on this side too so instead of growing this side, there's a blood vessel coming into it.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
So usually when this thing reaches the point that it goes to the blood vessel, you're in trouble because there's a chance of going to the other places in the colon okay.  If you find out the polyp when it's this small, it's going to be a very simple procedure, you're already in the colon with the camera, you just put in some stuff that you can cut off the polyp so you can just cut off the polyp and that's it.  If you find it this big, okay.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
If you find it this big, it's too risky to go with the uh endoscopy procedure so in that case we need surgery.  What kind of surgery we do is that we resect the colon here to get a safe margin.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
If you find it in this stage, when it goes into the bloodstream and goes to the other organs, basically surgery won't cure this.  If it's in the other organ it's going to be chemotherapy and the prognosis is going to be very bad.  So, the reason behind this is that if we find colon cancer in the early stage, it's just staying as a polyp and it's not, it's gonna be a very simple procedure and you won't get recurrence.  If you find, if you find it later, if you find it more later the risk of doing a surgery or not even getting the surgery increases.  So that is the rationale of doing this colonoscopy in everybody over 50 years old.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
So we have a lot of patients that we just find a small polyp and we remove the polyp and every polyp that is removed is sent to the Pathology Lab.  They look in the microscope and they see if it's malignant or not and then there are polyps that we see, okay this has a potential to become malignant, it was great that we found it and we just removed it in a simple procedure and @@@.

PATIENT V773
I'll have to think about it.

DOCTOR V773
Okay so if you could think about and you could let me know and uh, um yeah and then I can just schedule it okay.  So that's about it.

PATIENT V773
Uh could I pick up these medicines, this prescription today?

DOCTOR V773
Sure, sure, sure.  You have, you're running out of all medications?

PATIENT V773
Nah, no, see I got them all at different times.

DOCTOR V773
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V773
So one's going to run out before the other two.

DOCTOR V773
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V773
And then the other one runs out and then.

DOCTOR V773
@@@.

PATIENT V773
The orange pills I got all at once.

DOCTOR V773
So I'm going to refill all the medications okay.

PATIENT V773
Yeah and it's good for a year?

DOCTOR V773
Pardon?

PATIENT V773
How long is this prescription good for now?  How many fill-ups do I get?

DOCTOR V773

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
You know I get, I got four refills.

DOCTOR V773
Sure I can do that.  I'm going to give you like three or four refills so that you won't have to worry.

PATIENT V773
Uh I'll keep track, I'll keep track of my blood pressure.

DOCTOR V773
@@@.  Then have you ever talked about an Advanced Directive and stuff?

PATIENT V773
A what?

DOCTOR V773
Advanced Directive and a Power of Attorney?

PATIENT V773
Oh I got that through my kids and that yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Oh okay.  So you have the paperwork sent to the VA?

PATIENT V773
Do I have it done through the VA?  No.

DOCTOR V773
So you should read this, it's like authorization of what you want to do in the future.  

PATIENT V773
Uh.

DOCTOR V773
So you don't take any medication outside the VA?

PATIENT V773
No, like I say, the only thing I take is if I get a little flare-up of the gout.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
But other than that, no I don't take nothing.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
Other than an aspirin once in a while for a headache or something.

DOCTOR V773
Okay and then um so there's another screening, uh people over 65, have you ever smoked before?

PATIENT V773
Yeah I quit about 22 years ago.

DOCTOR V773
So have you ever had a screening of the ultrasound of the abdomen?

PATIENT V773
Yeah they did that, I think the last time I was in here.

DOCTOR V773
Okay, they did it last time?

PATIENT V773
Yeah, I remember they took a ultrasound of my stomach and that.

DOCTOR V773
Okay and that was normal?

PATIENT V773
As far as I know, they never said nothing.

DOCTOR V773
Okay, let's see.

PATIENT V773
I think it was last year.

DOCTOR V773
I'll just see it and I'm sure it's going to be uh for it so, oh there is uh okay, so you're good, you're done.

PATIENT V773
Okay.

DOCTOR V773
Good.  

PATIENT V773
So no sugars huh, no sweets?

DOCTOR V773
No sweets, no salt.

PATIENT V773
And no salt.

DOCTOR V773
No salt.

PATIENT V773
Is pepper okay?

DOCTOR V773
There's the pneumonia vaccine if you want to do it.

PATIENT V773
I think I had that last time too.

DOCTOR V773
Last time too, okay, alrighty, that's good.  Okay so, I'll see you in six months is that okay?  Or is once a year fine with you?

PATIENT V773
No I think once a year is fine.  I come in to the VA, I spend the whole day here, I got other stuff to do.

DOCTOR V773
Okay, so @@@ better for you?

PATIENT V773
Did you want me to make an appointment for that blood pressure thing?

DOCTOR V773
Oh they're going to make that.

PATIENT V773
About a month you said.

DOCTOR V773
When you check out they're gonna make it.

PATIENT V773
Yeah I mean in about another month?

DOCTOR V773
Yeah about another month.

PATIENT V773
Okay.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah and then at that time you have to bring the records of the blood pressure.

PATIENT V773
Okay.

DOCTOR V773
Could you just sit down and I'll listen to your heart and stuff?

PATIENT V773
Oh.

DOCTOR V773
And I recommend keep working on your weight because losing your weight can help blood pressure be regular and also the sugar too.

PATIENT V773
Okay.

DOCTOR V773
So that's all connected, everything is connected, your food, your lifestyle.

PATIENT V773
You're taking all the good things away from me though.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah I know so I have to do that, it's my job so. Deep breath, breathe out, once more, breathe out, that's good.  Okay so okay so I'll talk to my boss.

PATIENT V773
Okay.

DOCTOR V773
And then I'll come back here okay.

(DOCTOR OUT: 96:10  DOCTOR IN:  106:24)

DOCTOR V773
Let me call the Pharmacy.

PATIENT V773
Do you want me to keep taking this other medicine till I run out that I got now?

DOCTOR V773
Yeah, I'll talk to you about that.  @@@.  (Doctor makes phone call)  Do you want to pick it up at the Pharmacy?

PATIENT V773
Yeah I'll pick it up as long as I'm here today.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.  (Doctor still on phone)  Okay, all the medications are done.

PATIENT V773
So you're saying no salt at all on anything or?

DOCTOR V773
@@@ no salt right?

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
If you can do no salt, I mean you put extra salt on the food?

PATIENT V773
Well like some places, just say McDonald's for instance, I know their fries they use a little packet of salt.

DOCTOR V773
They use a lot of salt.  They use a lot of salt.  

PATIENT V773
You know like I say if I order French fries or something, I'll put a little bit of salt on that or.

DOCTOR V773
No, no, no.

PATIENT V773
Oh.

DOCTOR V773
That's very bad.

PATIENT V773
That's bad.

DOCTOR V773
Yeah so that's very bad because they already have salt in there.

PATIENT V773
Alright.

DOCTOR V773
Then you're adding extra salt in it.

PATIENT V773
Okay.  No salt, no sugar.

DOCTOR V773
No salt, no sugar.

PATIENT V773
No sugar in the coffee or?

DOCTOR V773
It's possible, it's possible.  I would recommend getting used to no sugar.

PATIENT V773
No sugar and just milk or.  How about on cereal?

DOCTOR V773
On cereal, no, no, no, no.

PATIENT V773
No, no, no, no.  

DOCTOR V773
No salt or anything.

PATIENT V773
No sugar.

DOCTOR V773
No sugar, no sugar, no sugar.

PATIENT V773
No sugar. 

DOCTOR V773
So maybe you can work on that first, no sugar, no salt.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
And after a while you can think about decreasing because like I told you, everything down the line is going to be horrible if you have hypertension and diabetes.

PATIENT V773
What's hypertension?  Is that high blood pressure?

DOCTOR V773
Yeah.  We see a lot of those patients, initially, it's like you, you're just like having high blood pressure.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Pre-diabetic and eventually when you end up in the hospital they have all the complications of diabetes so you can name everything and they have it, so if you have diabetes, you can lose your eyesight, can have dialysis because of the kidney problems.

PATIENT V773
Hmm.

DOCTOR V773
And then you have neuropathy so you don't feel anything in your legs or your hands and then sometimes that's painful and you get erectile dysfunction, you get difficulty in moving your GI tract after you eat and also because you don't have sensation, good sensation, you're at increased risk of infection and once you get an infection in the foot it's very difficult to treat.  When they go into the bone you have to amputate the foot.

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
So it's horrible, @@@.   So if you can stop here and prevent that from happening, that's gonna be, I think that'll be a great thing so.  So today.

PATIENT V773
Start eating fish though huh?

DOCTOR V773
Yeah.  Today, what I changed today is um uh, I said I'm going to go up on lisinopril too but it seems like the Pharmacy won't allow me to go up on the lisinopril.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
So I'm just going to increase the thiazide, the pill that you're cutting into half.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.  So I'll take one of those.

DOCTOR V773
Just start taking one of those and then the medication you want to pick up today is going to be the same pill.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
But um enough that you can take it every day.

PATIENT V773
Alright.

DOCTOR V773
Okay so like I gave you three refills and then you're going to come back in one month with your blood pressure log and if that is high I need to add another medication okay.

PATIENT V773
Okay.

DOCTOR V773
Um and then for your gout there's a medication that can prevent gout from happening.

PATIENT V773
They gave me that once before here but it didn't work.

DOCTOR V773
Um.

PATIENT V773
This goes back a few years, maybe three, four years.

DOCTOR V773
Well maybe, yeah I'm not sure but sometimes it doesn't work.

PATIENT V773
Is it a pill you gotta take every day?

DOCTOR V773
Yeah because of treatment, you've done this before or even people who are taking, it doesn't happen.  Um but still it decreases the risk that we know, we know that it decreases the risk.

PATIENT V773
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V773
Of happening so I think it’s reasonable to start that medication again.  We usually start in the lower dose and then we increase the dose as tolerated.  Um I'm going to check, I just added a uric acid level in your blood tests so that when the results come back and if it comes back and if it's high we'll increase the pills you're on.  This pill is only once a day, one tablet a day but you can increase to three pills a day if there's no issues.  Um so I'll let you know, I'll let you know about the results and uh I'll let you know if we're going to increase the medication or not but for now you can just take that one pill.

PATIENT V773
Well what happens if I get a flare-up of the gout, can I take this with the medicine that I'm taking?

DOCTOR V773
No this medication will prevent that, so if you get a flare-up this won't help.

PATIENT V773
So I could take the other pills that I've taken now for it?

DOCTOR V773
Yeah, yeah, the indomethacin.  Right, I probably, have you gotten indomethacin?

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
You can take that pill and if the pain is still uncontrolled you can call us and we'll give you other medications.

PATIENT V773
This is what I didn't want is all this medication for this and this cause I really don't understand how I had one pill you know, it's just you take a pill for this, a pill for this and a pill for this.

DOCTOR V773
So these three pills are for your blood pressure you know that right?

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
And what I'm adding is just one pill; it's for preventing from the gout from happening okay.

PATIENT V773
Okay.

DOCTOR V773
Make sense?

PATIENT V773
I'll give it a try and see what happens.

DOCTOR V773
For now we'll see what happens okay.  So I'll see you in one year but um we're going to see my nurse in one month.

PATIENT V773
One month.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
Alrighty.

DOCTOR V773
Okay so you know how to check out right?

PATIENT V773
Yeah.

DOCTOR V773
Okay.

PATIENT V773
So I got to rid of this.

DOCTOR V773
Just give this to the check out.

PATIENT V773
Okay.

DOCTOR V773
Have a good day now.

PATIENT V773
You uh, now I can just go down to the Pharmacy and that stuff will be down in the Pharmacy?

DOCTOR V773
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT V773
Okay.  Alright thank you very much.

DOCTOR V773
