DOCTOR E862
PATIENT?


PATIENT E862
Yeah.


DOCTOR E862
@@@ over here. All right.  Dr. DOCTOR usually is the person who takes care of you?


PATIENT E862
Yeah.


DOCTOR E862
Okay.


PATIENT E862
Well he.


DOCTOR E862
What can I do for ya?


PATIENT E862
Well, the reason uh we called today is they called me to uh, uh talk to my doctor about the brace I had on my legs.


DOCTOR E862
Okay.


PATIENT E862
The reason I didn't uh wear it today is because uh uh the weather was bad and I couldn't get transportation, anybody drive me, so I took it off and drove it myself.  But for the past four or five days now I've been taking it off after supper which is 4 o'clock till about 6 and I'm walkin around the room and going downstairs and stuff like that, not doing any steps and things and it hasn't been bothering me.


DOCTOR E862
Okay.


PATIENT E862
I got the new walker so it helps.


DOCTOR E862
Before that it was bothering you?


PATIENT E862
Yeah, I my balance and stuff like that and uh, uh, the swelling and everything went down and they finally took more x-rays and it so they said it wasn’t an infection or anything it was arthritic, arthritic condition.


DOCTOR E862
Oh.


PATIENT E862
And they can't give me nothing for it until after the operation I'm having Thursday.


DOCTOR E862
Okay.  Do you have some left knee pain?


PATIENT E862
Not now, no.


DOCTOR E862
That's what it was like before.



PATIENT E862
Yeah, this whole thing, I couldn't sit, and turn it, I couldn't bend it.


DOCTOR E862
Okay.


PATIENT E862
You know like now I can, I always have to keep it straight, but for the past couple of months I've been wearing that brace and just taking it off at night.


DOCTOR E862
And now you're taking it off after dinner?


PATIENT E862
Yeah.  Like uh about three days now I've been taking it off and walking around and . . . 


DOCTOR E862
You've been able to walk okay?


PATIENT E862
Yeah, now yeah, yeah, real good now.  Before I couldn't, without without that brace I couldn't walk uh, I couldn't walk five feet.

DOCTOR E862
Okay.  You're not wearing any right now though?


PATIENT E862
No, no.  And the antibiotics they gave me and painkillers they gave me have actually been killing, killing the stuff and the swelling.


DOCTOR E862
Now, so who gave you that uh, those medications that you're talking about?


PATIENT E862
Uh, I got the paper here, in the Emergency Room.


DOCTOR E862
Okay, that was when you were here at the ER.


PATIENT E862
Yeah, yeah.


DOCTOR E862
All right.


PATIENT E862
She didn't do nothing with me, I haven't seen her since you know, I think, I didn't know you're supposed to talk to her, I thought I was supposed to go back to the Emergency and they would take it off or something, that's the reason uh I couldn't see her until way up till next year.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.  All right.  I'm gonna read, just looking at the X-ray report.


PATIENT E862
Yeah.


DOCTOR E862
All right, looks like things are doing a lot better.  The x-ray looks fine and it sounds like your symptoms are better now?


PATIENT E862
I'm smiling.


DOCTOR E862
Uh-huh.  Let's take a look here.  All right.  So where was the pain mainly?


PATIENT E862
Right in this, in this area here.  I couldn't do this and if I did, I'd be crying.


DOCTOR E862
@@@.


PATIENT E862
It's terrific pain.


DOCTOR E862
And now you're able to move it better?


PATIENT E862
Yes if I don't, if I don't like in bed, if I don't push too fast, too far, uh I'm alright.


DOCTOR E862
Good.


PATIENT E862
If I do I feel it.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
But otherwise if I just take my time getting up and walking and turning and that stuff, hey I can do without the brace, I even drove a car first time in two months.


DOCTOR E862
Alright, excellent.  And the other knee how's that one doing?


PATIENT E862
Well that's uh, it ain't bad but you know, yeah.  They figured it's gonna go the same way.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
And that's tough, I don't know why.


DOCTOR E862
Okay.  Well since its, since it’s doing so much better I don't think that we have a whole lot of work to do today.  I'm glad to hear that.


PATIENT E862
Yeah, you, oh God.  I talked it over with the head nurse at the retirement place and I said off the record, I said what'd happen to me if I, if I took it off and I sit for a couple of hours instead of taking it off at 9 or 10 o'clock at night and going to bed, what if I take it off at 6 and walk around with a walker and she said try it, so she was with me three nights in a row.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
And she says how ya doing, how's your balance, you tell me how my balance is and she say you're good alright.


DOCTOR E862
Alright.


PATIENT E862
Try it.



DOCTOR E862
I would say just follow that same pattern, take it off a little bit earlier.


PATIENT E862
Yeah.


DOCTOR E862
And make sure that you've got some stability.


PATIENT E862
Yeah.


DOCTOR E862
Alright good.


PATIENT E862
With this is the new walker that they gave me downstairs it helps a lot.  I borrowed a buddy of mines @@@.  I used to walk with a cane but that was not stable enough and I couldn't drive my car but uh no, as far as my sugar and blood pressure, I I brought my books with me if you want.


DOCTOR E862
No that's alright I'm going to have Dr. DOCTOR take care of most of that.


PATIENT E862
Alright, okay, alright.


DOCTOR E862
I think though looking at your numbers everything looks very good.


PATIENT E862
Uh-huh.


DOCTOR E862
You're uh diabetes looks good.


PATIENT E862
Uh, I need some test strips for my sugar, uh, do I call the . . .

DOCTOR E862
No I can get it for ya.


PATIENT E862
Yeah, oh okay.  I got about ten strips left, Monday, Wednesday and Friday and that's three, six, nine, I've got about the end of the month to go with.  I always like to get ahead of time.  No that's good to hear.  No all I got to do is sweat out Thursday.


DOCTOR E862
Thursday what's that?


PATIENT E862
That's the operation of the colon or the bladder.


DOCTOR E862
Oh yeah that's right.


PATIENT E862
And that's what I'm afraid of.


DOCTOR E862
You're going to be okay.


PATIENT E862
Um.  In the 1970s, late 1970s, I had prostate cancer and that was uh partially malignant and stuff like that.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
So, and I couldn't do nothing for, I went there the day after, the Monday after Labor Day and I didn't go back to work until the week of Thanksgiving so, all that time off, I figured oh God this things gonna be the same way, I'm kind of jumpy.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah, I don't know if this one's gonna be quite like that.


PATIENT E862
No?


DOCTOR E862
I don't think it is.


PATIENT E862
And every time I hear the word malignancy that, that uh, that's what my wife died of.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah, it makes you think about that.


PATIENT E862
Yeah.


DOCTOR E862
Well.


PATIENT E862
And me, I as a Polish guy that's a joke.


DOCTOR E862
Come on up here.


PATIENT E862
That's a joke, I I you talk about being Polish and that's got two strikes on ya.


DOCTOR E862
Ha, ha.


PATIENT E862
But uh, the first strike was in the 1970s with malignant cancer of the prostate, @@@ was malignant so that's what I'm kind of scared of.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah well, you'll just have to see what happens.


PATIENT E862
You want me to take it off?


DOCTOR E862
That's okay I'll put it on over the top. They already checked it once, I'm gonna check it again.


PATIENT E862
Yeah, uh-huh.


DOCTOR E862
I like your hat.


PATIENT E862
That's yeah, uh, uh, I was buying some tools at a tool place right by the house there.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
And uh, and she says my sister works there as an assistant or something, to help vets and she gave me this.
DOCTOR E862
It’s very nice. @@@.  Alright you can lay back down, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go talk with my boss about what's going on but I think I like the way your knee is healing.


PATIENT E862
Hey I would be, I wouldn't be smiling if it uh wasn't, look.  Oh God this thing's been bothering me for a long time.


DOCTOR E862
The knee finally, the knee is finally getting better huh?


PATIENT E862
Oh yeah.


DOCTOR E862
Well I wouldn't give up on the brace all together.


PATIENT E862
No, no, no.


DOCTOR E862
@@@.  Alright.  Yeah, I'll be right back okay.


PATIENT E862
Yeah.

(DOCTOR OUT: 84:04 DOCTOR IN:  88:46)

DOCTOR E862
Okay.  I think uh, about the knee, what I want you to do is wear the brace when you're not gonna be too active um, during the day.  Take it off after dinner.  You can try taking it off a little earlier each day if you want to, make sure that the knee is feeling good and not feeling off balance or anything and then as you gradually take it away you won't need it at all but I'd keep it around.


PATIENT E862
Oh yeah, that uh, I got it right by the bed there.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah because I think it's gonna be helpful for you to have around.


PATIENT E862
Oh yeah.


DOCTOR E862
If it feels unstable or starts to hurt again.


PATIENT E862
Right.


DOCTOR E862
Okay?


PATIENT E862
I feel uh, I could never do this, this or this, oh God.


DOCTOR E862
That's terrific.  No, I'm I'm so happy for you as well.


PATIENT E862
(Crying) This was . . . I’m living at this place for three years.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
And uh, I thought I'd found a place, then the damn stroke two years ago and this thing here, oh shit this uh.


DOCTOR E862
And you said they wouldn't let you stay there?


PATIENT E862
Uh no, just the idea of ya see, uh, the years of contentment and stuff like that you know, they kind of you know, and I figured that's what I wanted you know and I lost my wife 13 years ago and I'm living by myself and no cooking, no nothing and you know and then finding a place you got meals and once a week they, they come in and clean your apartment and stuff, they have good meals.

DOCTOR E862

PATIENT E862

DOCTOR E862

PATIENT E862

DOCTOR E862

PATIENT E862
Not only the tenants up there, the neighbors, the management oh they uh, when I came here one time with the leg and that stuff and when I was passing blood and uh I caught hell because I didn't say nothing to them, oh when I come back they really raised holy hell with me.

PATIENT E862

DOCTOR E862
Thank you.


PATIENT E862
I finally changed my mind.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
Cause I used to come here in 1949.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
And gifts to the Yanks and stuff like that to deliver packages to all the guys in the hospital.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
Uh, all the reservists from five different armories in Chicago would wrap gifts and then we'd pick them up with the tractor trailers and bring em up here to Hines, Great Lakes, Fort Sheridan, West Side, @@@ Hospital and here.  We all used to pay tribute to the @@@ Hines as we come up the old building.


DOCTOR E862
Really.


PATIENT E862
They used to have that big portrait that used to hang from ceiling on down to the floor, standing and they’d always film us saluting when we'd come in.  His father was real good about building the place, donating property here.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
The whole mile, mile square you know.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.  Alright sir, good luck with your surgery.


PATIENT E862
I hope that, I hope it comes off, ha ha.


DOCTOR E862
I think it's gonna go well.  I really think it's gonna go well for you.


PATIENT E862
Well.  Good thank you.  I, I hope to be like my mother.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah.


PATIENT E862
103.


DOCTOR E862
Oh my goodness.


PATIENT E862
My father was 95.


DOCTOR E862
That's a long life.


PATIENT E862
And uh, I hope I can continue with that but the way I'm going now, I feel like I'm lucky if I reach 85.  I just passed 84 so I don't know.


DOCTOR E862
I think, I think what's important is how well you live, not how long.


PATIENT E862
Well this place here, that's what I'm teed off about, being sick like that and because with all the activities they got up there.


DOCTOR E862
Yeah, you got some friends that live in there too?


PATIENT E862
