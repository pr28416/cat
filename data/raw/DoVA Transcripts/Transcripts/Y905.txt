PATIENT Y905
Okay and I have like a tingling sensation in my leg and my back, everything's on my left side and then they did a MRI and then they never told me anything else about my prostate when they found a spot on it.

DOCTOR Y905
Oh it looks like you're seeing the prostate doctors right?

PATIENT Y905
Right.

DOCTOR Y905
And uh yeah I think that was your kidney that they found the spot on, not the prostate.

PATIENT Y905
Oh the kidney.

DOCTOR Y905
Right so I think they didn't really think much of it, kind of reading their notes.  They just wanted to follow you.

PATIENT Y905
They told me my prostate was swelled and there was a spot on my prostate.

DOCTOR Y905
No they said.

PATIENT Y905
A lesion.

DOCTOR Y905
In your prostate?

PATIENT Y905
Yeah.

DOCTOR Y905
They said there was a lesion on your kidney.  

PATIENT Y905
Oh my kidney, oh okay.

DOCTOR Y905
But the thing is is that it's gonna be hard for us to, it looks like.  Have you been able to take your blood pressure medicine?

PATIENT Y905
Yeah.

DOCTOR Y905
Cause it looks like you haven't refilled it since December.

PATIENT Y905
That's because I had a lot.

DOCTOR Y905
Okay.

PATIENT Y905
You know I had a lot.

DOCTOR Y905
Okay.  Yeah it's gonna be hard for us to like treat the rest of your pain you know if you're not really taking your blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT Y905
I thought they said today its like 133 or 136, yeah.

DOCTOR Y905
Uh let me see exactly what it is.

PATIENT Y905

DOCTOR Y905
So it looks like.  Okay.

PATIENT Y905
When I came in I just had a stock pile at home.

DOCTOR Y905
Okay.  Uh it looks like uh let's see we did this, you had an x-ray done of like your hip and your knee.  It looks like you got arthritis um, let's see.  Well you know for the pain you're having in your leg and your back you know we could probably do physical therapy cause we haven't sent you to Physical Therapy.  Um.

PATIENT Y905
You know I'm doing a lot of exercising myself so I don't even know if physical therapy would work.

DOCTOR Y905
You know otherwise there's not, I mean I could send you to see the orthopedic surgeons to see if they'd like to operate on you but other than that there's not a whole lot we can do for arthritis.

PATIENT Y905
Okay so that, actually everything I'm having in my leg that's due to arthritis?

DOCTOR Y905
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y905
Okay what's, you know the other day I was watching this program on PAD.

DOCTOR Y905

DOCTOR Y905

PATIENT Y905
You know uh.

DOCTOR Y905
What symptoms are those?

PATIENT Y905
Uh poor circulation you know.

DOCTOR Y905
Well it's just poor circulation isn't a symptom.  Like symptoms are like pain and tenderness and tingling.  Poor circulation.

PATIENT Y905
See I have that tingling and you know like I said the tingling it's like someone is @@@ apart.

DOCTOR Y905
Yeah.

PATIENT Y905
Like cold water on the inside and it's like it's draining and running down the inside of my leg.

DOCTOR Y905
Well why don't you have a seat, let's take a look at it, how about that.

PATIENT Y905
And like I said this here on my left side, they said kidney because you know almost everything is on my left side.  Right, you know I have the soreness, stuff all on my left side.

PATIENT Y905
Cause as a matter of fact the last time I went to the doctor was for my prostate.

DOCTOR Y905
For gross hematuria, @@@ left renal mass, MRI, you had the MRI they didn't really see that much.  So it seems like they uh, so it just seems like they want to follow you for it.  They don't think it's much.  They think it might be a cyst on your kidney but.

PATIENT Y905
Check on, you know the last time I went over there and @@@ doctor told me that my prostate was swelled right.

DOCTOR Y905
