Date of Encounter:  @@/@@/@@  
Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR S614
Alright you even got me under @@@ a couple of times.

SECOND PERSON 
Yeah that looks okay.

PATIENT S614
We're doing good.  

SECOND PERSON S614
But we were at Dermatology.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah but I'm working on it.  I know the last time it was very late.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Um so.

PATIENT J239
Yeah we saw you come in late too today.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah don't tell anybody else.

SECOND PERSON S614
Don't tell anybody else.

PATIENT S614
I don't squeal.

DOCTOR S614
Alright so how have both of you been?

PATIENT S614
Good, still above ground.

DOCTOR S614
Good, good.  And you saw the dermatologist this morning?

PATIENT S614
Yeah, she shot me up.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah he @@@.

DOCTOR S614
Oh you know they froze all that stuff.  That's what they like to do, that's the whole treatment.

PATIENT S614
She had one of those fire knives, @@@.  I think she treated those @@@ spots on my arms from getting too much sun outside.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON S614
He needs some medications.

DOCTOR S614
Oh @@@ refills, I've got it right here.

SECOND PERSON S614
Metolazone and magnesium oxide that I know of.

DOCTOR S614
Looks like niacin, is he taking that?

SECOND PERSON S614
No he's not taking the niacin.

PATIENT S614
What's that?

SECOND PERSON S614
The niacin that uh uh the doctor, who told us to take the niacin?

PATIENT S614
I have no idea.

SECOND PERSON S614
Did you tell us to take the niacin?

DOCTOR S614
I might have, yes, yeah it was me.  You didn't like that?

SECOND PERSON S614
No it's that we talked to the cardiologist and he said uh he didn't think it was necessary, let's just try the fish oil a little longer.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.

SECOND PERSON S614
And see how it works.

PATIENT S614
And the fish oil I still take.

DOCTOR S614
Oh he does.

PATIENT S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

PATIENT S614
And what's that other pill I'm cutting twice too?

SECOND PERSON S614
The hydralazine.

PATIENT S614
That's the orange pill.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, it's the hydralazine.  That's for the blood pressure, is that for blood pressure?

DOCTOR S614
Yep.

SECOND PERSON S614
Uh that's the water pill?

DOCTOR S614
Not hydralazine um.

SECOND PERSON S614
That's the one he takes, supposed to take three times a day.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON S614
He took that to twice a day cause he was getting dizzy.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.  When did you see the cardiologist?  Was this at an outside cardiologist?

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.  I mean the niacin is fine.  I’ll defer to the…

SECOND PERSON S614
That's @@@.

DOCTOR S614
Uh your cholesterol is a little bit high.  The higher it is, the more risk that there's gonna be essel disease.  At 83 we don't know if that would be the best you know, we need our goals to be. 

PATIENT S614
@@@.

DOCTOR S614
Oh you @@@ what we use is the literature that averages people out.  People that they study are between 40 and 60 usually.  So we don't know if we need to be as aggressive with somebody after they're 80.  I mean the risks of having drug interactions like you've already had with other medicines.

PATIENT S614
Hmm.

DOCTOR S614
Um goes up so.  How aggressive do we need to be uh but we also don't want to have problems.

PATIENT S614
I had that other medication and that didn't work.

SECOND PERSON S614
Well that's what he's talking about.

PATIENT S614
And I experienced that once.

DOCTOR S614
Hydralazine is a medicine that the way it works is that every eight hours; it's three times a day.

SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.

DOCTOR S614
If you don't take three times a day, it will be worn off before the next dose so that there's.  I mean I don't want to step on the cardiologist's toes.

SECOND PERSON S614
No, no, he didn't tell, he didn't tell us not to take it.  He just decided not to take it cause he was getting dizzy.

DOCTOR S614
Like he told you twice instead of three times?

SECOND PERSON S614
No he, he.

PATIENT S614
He told us three.

DOCTOR S614
Oh.

SECOND PERSON S614
It's three times a day the way he prescribed it and he didn't have anything to do with it.  We decided that maybe if he took it twice a day he wouldn't feel that uh lightheadedness.

PATIENT S614
Yes.

DOCTOR S614
Well I mean, did you bring in your blood pressure cuff though?  Did you have them synchronize it or no?

SECOND PERSON S614
I don't know.

DOCTOR S614
I mean did you bring it into the clinic today; did you bring it to the nurse?

SECOND PERSON S614
The what?

PATIENT S614
No.

SECOND PERSON S614
The blood sugars or the?

DOCTOR S614
Yeah, no the cuff.  Remember how we were having this problem.

SECOND PERSON S614
Oh.

DOCTOR S614
You're always high.

SECOND PERSON J239
That's right, you told us I just, I forgot.

DOCTOR S614
It's no big deal cause actually it looks good today.

PATIENT S614
What did you need from home?

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.  The one that we’re doing at home?  He wanted us to bring our machine to check it with the nurses.

PATIENT S614
Oh.

DOCTOR S614
It’s all right. I mean it's not a huge deal but I know there was that discrepancy.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, it was always high here.

DOCTOR S614
It was always high here and.

SECOND PERSON S614
It was normal at home.

DOCTOR S614
Always normal.

SECOND PERSON S614
Now I'll go with normal occasionally.

PATIENT S614
They have me going on @@@ bring the machine.

DOCTOR S614
Uh no today your blood pressure looked good.

SECOND PERSON S614
It should, yeah well he was more relaxed today I guess.

DOCTOR S614
Good, good.  Um okay so otherwise um other than these issues with the hydralazine what.

SECOND PERSON S614
You don't think he should take it twice a day, that's not a good idea?

DOCTOR S614
Oh, well yeah what I'm saying is if we need to change it to something else we can but I don't think that's the best way to go about it because I mean the reasons that we, the medicines are certain time periods is because that's how they work.  If it was the hydralazine XL, and it was once a day.

SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.

DOCTOR S614
That would work 24 hours.  That’s why some medicines are once a day, some are three times a day.  Not because the three times a day ones are stronger but because the once a day ones go on slow and off slow, and the three times a day one goes on fast and off fast and if you don't take them three times a day there's a risk that so in the middle of the day your blood pressure is.

SECOND PERSON S614
Gonna go up.

DOCTOR S614
200 and.

PATIENT S614
Well why were my sugars was off?

SECOND PERSON S614
Not your sugars your blood pressure.

PATIENT S614
Well I'm just saying.

SECOND PERSON S614
Blood pressure.

PATIENT S614
Sometimes it happens to me.  I put some @@@ stuff in the back of my neck.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah sugars are a little different.

PATIENT S614
@@@.

SECOND PERSON S614
What else could be causing him to get lightheaded and dizzy?

DOCTOR S614
So that's what we have to talk about.  When are you feeling this?

PATIENT S614
Mostly in the morning.

DOCTOR S614
And you're saying.  Uh so in the morning you start to feel dizzy and lightheaded.

PATIENT S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
And is this when you open your eyes in bed or once you get up and get around?

PATIENT S614
When I get up I start to move.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.

SECOND PERSON S614
Sometimes.

PATIENT S614
Maybe a little aggressive in the morning, I don’t know, but it catches up with me right away and I gotta go sit down.

SECOND PERSON S614
Is it before you take your medication or after?

PATIENT S614
Yeah it's before the medicine.

SECOND PERSON S614
Before you take your medicine.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.

PATIENT S614
The @@@.

DOCTOR S614
Okay and this is kind of new?  Starting to be worse, how would you say?

PATIENT S614
It just seems like certain, certain times.  Sometimes I'll go for maybe weeks nothing and then in one week, two or three days I'm in the morning I get up and by the time I come downstairs and start to move in the kitchen I get lightheaded and I gotta go sit in the chair.  Not for long but.

DOCTOR S614
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S614
I can't walk; I can't continue to walk around.

DOCTOR S614
Okay. 

PATIENT S614
I feel weak.

DOCTOR S614
And do you feel like it's happening more often now?

PATIENT S614
Not really, no not really, just certain days I get up and I just can't function.  I want to do something and I say forget about it, I'm not doing it.  I want to do something outside and I say uh uh, forget about it, going back.

DOCTOR S614
Um and there's nothing that you can tell when it's gonna come on?

PATIENT S614
No.

DOCTOR S614
It's uh like before you take your meds, before you have any meals?

PATIENT S614
Before I have anything.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.  Do you feel like uh do you ever check your blood sugar at that time?

PATIENT S614
I check it in the morning.  Some days it's 140, some days it's higher.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.

PATIENT S614
But if it's low I'm shaky, I @@@.

DOCTOR S614
Uh do you notice that the blood sugar is associated with this feeling of dizziness at all?  Is it higher when you feel dizzy?

PATIENT S614
No, no @@@ no.

DOCTOR S614
It's kind of independent of that.

PATIENT S614
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S614
Um.  Okay.

SECOND PERSON S614
I thought it might be the blood pressure, not the blood sugar.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah exactly, that's the other thing uh.  When you say dizzy I know we said lightheaded already but do you feel like the room's spinning around you?  Or do you feel more like you're about to pass out?

PATIENT S614
I'm just weak.

DOCTOR S614
Weak.

PATIENT S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Uh.

PATIENT S614
I feel like, I'm afraid to do anything @@@.

SECOND PERSON S614
He's not steady on his feet.

DOCTOR S614
Uh-huh.  Any chest pain or palpitations?

PATIENT S614
No.

DOCTOR S614
Uh okay and you never had any episodes of actually passing out recently?

PATIENT S614
No.  Probably a year or so ago.

SECOND PERSON S614
When you passed out? That was three years ago. But that was a sugar related thing yeah.  That was not.  Could the blood pressure medication have something to do with it?

DOCTOR S614
Yeah that's what I was trying to look at it.  It could be a couple different things.  It might, I know you feel bad and it's a bad feeling but it might be because of the medication but not necessarily a bad side effect of the medication.  Um one of the medications, the one you take at night the atenolol.

SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S614
Have you always taken that at night?

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.  That may be one that we might want to switch you to the morning @@@ because that medication, the atenolol it will work.  How it works is it prevents the heart from beating too fast and what, the good thing about that is that uh that way your heart, your blood pressure doesn't go up because your heart doesn’t push the really fast and pump the blood pressure way up.

PATIENT S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Uh that's kind of one of the ways that that medicine works in multiple ways that we don't necessarily even understand but that's one of the ways it does that.

PATIENT S614
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S614
The problem is that if you want to do anything and exert yourself what the physiological, what the body does is it increases your heart rate so that your brain can get that, so your muscles can get all the blood, so your body wants the blood pressure up a little bit um.  If we give you this medication that doesn't allow your heart to speed up fast sometimes if you move around really quickly your body can't adjust to that.  Your heart can't adjust to that really fast so it makes you feel a little dizzy or lightheaded.

SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S614
And it can be to the point where you fall down.  That's when we say @@@.

PATIENT S614
I personally think it's just that I get up and I'm doing much too fast.

DOCTOR S614
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S614
I'm @@@ and I'm not going anywhere.

DOCTOR S614
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S614
And when that happens I just find a chair and then I go sit down.

DOCTOR S614
And another of the, on top of that, just um as we get older, we get into our 38s.  Um.

PATIENT S614
@@@ huh.

DOCTOR S614
The vessels because less compliant before when you're young the vessels can open and close a little bit more and you can variations in how we move around and stuff can be, that can help with that and as we get older the vessels don't do that as much.

PATIENT S614
They don’t function.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah they don't function fast enough so that they can't adjust when you get up really fast or you do a lot all at once.  Um I would say to start with um your heart rhythm looks fine so I don't think we're giving you too much of the atenolol.

SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.

DOCTOR S614
Um if it was down in the 50s or something I'd say we'll back off on that and see how you do um what I would say to start out is basically kind of lifestyle modification stuff.  Get up slower um, especially in the morning.  A lot of people will actually get out of bed and go jump in the shower.  Kind of slow movements, get up, sit down on the side of the bed for a second and then stand up.  Um don't do it all at once, the same with anything, just sitting on the couch.  Uh be careful about standing up really fast or getting up to go to the door.

PATIENT S614
Sudden moves, yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah um because that can also precipitate kind of this feeling of weakness.

PATIENT S614
That’s possible that’s what it is.

DOCTOR S614
Oh.

PATIENT S614
I get up and I come down, because we’re @@@.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah then the next step, I would say, if you're still feeling bad about that would be to switch this medication to the morning instead of late at night because what happens is you take this at night time and your heart rate goes down anyway at night.

SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S614
And you also have this medication that's on, it's a 24 hour medication so it's working all day but um theoretically it can be a little stronger, it can be like the peak of it will be right in the morning.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
So that maybe what's happening is that your heart rate's already slow from just, from sleeping, you're body's response and then on top of that you have a medication that slows it down a little bit more.

PATIENT S614
Yeah more.

DOCTOR S614
And then when you get up you're having symptoms so, it's not bad that it's on at night and we have lots of people on it at night and in the morning, it doesn't matter as long as you take it the same time of day.  So if you wanted to move that one to the morning and move one of the other blood pressure medicines to nighttime, which I'd recommend the fosinopril that you have to nighttime.

SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S614
Um just so you have, I mean you're taking the same amount of medications.

PATIENT S614
Different times.

DOCTOR S614
But we might prevent this a little bit more and see if it doesn't help.

SECOND PERSON S614
But keep the hydralazine at three times a day?

DOCTOR S614
I would.  I would unless you notice at home the blood pressure is below 90 on the top number.

SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.

DOCTOR S614
Which that would be.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, it's never been there no.

DOCTOR S614
Um cause that's when you start really seeing symptoms.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah well it's never been there.

DOCTOR S614
Being less than 100 or less than 90 uh that's when we @@@.

SECOND PERSON S614
No his blood pressure's usually about 145/67 and I don't know, is 145 is not too high for the age or?

DOCTOR S614
So again a lot of these things, we look at all these younger people and say, when they're blood pressure is under 140 or even under 130 they do better in the long run.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Ten, twenty years down the line.

SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S614
Um for you I don't know if we have to be that aggressive.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Especially if you're having other symptoms.  If we get aggressive about the blood pressure and you fall and hit your head, we didn't do you any favors you know.

SECOND PERSON S614
That's uh right.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.  So um I would say we can slowly work on it but um I'm not going to simply go in and throw you on a bunch of new medications.

PATIENT S614
Medications.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.

PATIENT S614
Cause I got enough changes in @@@.

SECOND PERSON S614
No it's just.

DOCTOR S614
And.

SECOND PERSON S614
What he's on now seems to be working fine.

DOCTOR S614
Good.

SECOND PERSON S614
Except that this lightheadedness.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON S614
I didn't know but your suggestion sounds good.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON S614
To switch those medications.

DOCTOR S614
If the blood pressure's starting to go up that's when we really want to do something.

PATIENT S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
But um, if it's staying the same or even improving like it was today it was better than it did the last time.

SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S614
I would keep what we're doing on and not worry so much that.

PATIENT S614
Just slow down.

DOCTOR S614
In the 140s.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah just slow down.

SECOND PERSON S614
Don't try to move.  Don't try to move too fast.

DOCTOR S614
Um the metolazone that you're on, I couldn't find it for some reason, you just take them on Tuesdays and Thursdays right?

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
@@@.  You get all of these in the mail?

SECOND PERSON S614
Yes we do.

PATIENT S614
She's been doing @@@ prescriptions.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.  

PATIENT S614
I think we just called in last week.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, there were no more prescriptions.

PATIENT S614
Right, which ones, @@@.

DOCTOR S614
Otherwise doing pretty good?

SECOND PERSON S614
He's got a scratch on his leg.  I don't know if his leg is infected or.

DOCTOR S614
What'd the dermatologist say?

SECOND PERSON S614
He didn't look at it.

DOCTOR S614
He didn't look at it.

SECOND PERSON S614
No.

DOCTOR S614
When did this happen?

SECOND PERSON S614
About I think last week.

PATIENT S614
Last week.

SECOND PERSON S614
Wednesday.

DOCTOR S614
So did you just scratch that.  Did you fall, you didn't fall?

PATIENT S614
Uh  bench on a deck.

SECOND PERSON S614
And we've been treating it with uh flushing it with saline water and putting an antibiotic on it.

DOCTOR S614
Just like a triple antibiotic?

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, triple antibiotic but then I noticed it started to get red but it's not feverish.

DOCTOR S614
No.  Have you.

SECOND PERSON S614
Just like.

DOCTOR S614
Is it painful?

PATIENT S614
No.

SECOND PERSON S614
It's like cellulitis.

PATIENT S614
But as soon as I touch something I, I know I get an infection.

SECOND PERSON S614
He's prone to infection.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.

PATIENT S614
Because of my sugars.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah um, if the sugars are up then infections are more likely but.

PATIENT S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Your sugars haven't been that bad.  The other thing is with having, you've had diabetes for a while now right?

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
With diabetes you get um, @@@ um you get diseases in our arteries and veins and stuff and so what happens is that if there's not good blood flow there then none of the things that cause us to fight off infection are there.  That's not painful when I press?

PATIENT S614
Just a little bit, not much.  It's gotten better.  But there was.

DOCTOR S614
Did you have it there too?

PATIENT S614
Yeah it was up there too.

DOCTOR S614
I don't think it's infected but uh do you wear, do you have compression stockings or anything like that?

PATIENT S614
No.

SECOND PERSON S614
He has them but he doesn't wear them.  We wrapped his leg up sometimes.

DOCTOR S614
It's not, it's not infected but um it's just kind of what we call hyperemic around there because it's gotten angry and because it's uh.

SECOND PERSON S614
It's gotten mad at us.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah exactly.

SECOND PERSON S614
When he hit uh, when he hit the bench he was mad.

DOCTOR S614
You were mad?

SECOND PERSON S614
He was mad.  He was angry then.

PATIENT S614
When I @@@.

DOCTOR S614
Right, yes.  Let me listen to you.  Deep breaths in and out.  Just breathe normal.  Well it might help in the short term to get, to make sure that that blood keeps flowing through that area and it doesn't just stay there um to help.  If you notice this getting any more swollen or the redness starting rather than staying the same or getting better, if it starts to spread, especially going up that's when we start thinking about infections.  Let's just say you're more prone to infection so keep doing what you're doing.  Keep the um.

PATIENT S614
Antibiotic.

DOCTOR S614
Antibiotic.  Usually what I say is you can keep it open during the day if you need to get it some air or whatever but at night put it on and cover it.

PATIENT S614
Well I'm just putting cotton gauze.

DOCTOR S614
No that's fine.

PATIENT S614
I don't put any medication.

DOCTOR S614
Oh I mean that's all fine too.  To be honest with you the triple antibiotic thing we do it because we think it helps but there's never been any research that's proven that it helps.

SECOND PERSON S614
Well you know the thing is when it was oozing.

DOCTOR S614
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON S614
It was, it uh prevented from sticking to the gauze.

DOCTOR S614
The medicine was good for that.

SECOND PERSON S614
So that's why I used it.  Now it's drying up quite a bit.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON S614
But then the redness started to and I see one of his ankles started to get all red, I said this is something.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah so.

SECOND PERSON S614
But it's not hot, it's not feverish.

DOCTOR S614
Right.  Those are all like if it's starts becoming more painful, if it starts to get swollen.  If the redness you think is getting worse, progressing, uh then you can either come in to Urgent Care Clinic or you can give the clinic a call and um they can call me and I'll call you back either send you something out.

SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.

DOCTOR S614
Or do something.  I mean it's not; it's not going to need anything right now.

SECOND PERSON S614
It doesn't need an antibiotic?

DOCTOR S614
Not just yet cause it's not gonna help.

PATIENT S614
Could you send me that stuff like to wash?

SECOND PERSON S614
The saline, we can get that.

PATIENT S614
Okay.

DOCTOR S614
I'm not sure.

SECOND PERSON S614
Saline water.

DOCTOR S614
Just water.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah the saline.

DOCTOR S614
I can see if I can put it in.

SECOND PERSON S614
Saline solution.

PATIENT S614
Is that paper?

DOCTOR S614
Oh you're allergic to the tape.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah he's allergic to that tape.

DOCTOR S614
Is silk okay?

SECOND PERSON S614
Yep.  He's allergic that tape.  That would cause us big problems.

DOCTOR S614
Then it would get more red.

SECOND PERSON S614
Then it would get more red.

PATIENT S614
When I had my appendix, the appendix healed and I was all covered with blisters and they found out it was the tape so now whenever anything happens, I say, paper only.

DOCTOR S614
Uh the other thing it looks like were you gonna see the GI doctors?

SECOND PERSON S614
Well he was supposed to in May but we never got an appointment.

PATIENT S614
I went you to put in a prescription.  They told me last week, to re-examine my hearing you have to put in my prescription.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah Audiology so just so they redo the hearing test?

PATIENT S614
Yes cause she's thinking that I might be due for new hearing aids.

DOCTOR S614
What do you think, are you just ignoring her?

PATIENT S614
No.

SECOND PERSON S614
Maybe it ain't the hearing.

PATIENT S614
No, no, no.

SECOND PERSON S614
But she, she, when we went there last year, late last year, she said you're not due till July of 2010 and you have to make an appointment through our primary doctor.

PATIENT S614
And I think you better put in the.

DOCTOR S614
And you've seen, you saw them last year yeah before.

PATIENT S614
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON S614
For Audiology.

DOCTOR S614
GI.

SECOND PERSON S614
GI they never called us.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah and that's weird.  We'll schedule an appointment today, no problem.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Um let me make sure and when did you see them last?

PATIENT S614
I think a year ago.

SECOND PERSON S614
GI?  In 08.

DOCTOR S614
08.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

PATIENT S614
Been two years.

DOCTOR S614
Okay and if it's been over two years they want us to put in a new consult but … May ‘08.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah I think it was May 5th when we.

DOCTOR S614
So I'll just put in another one just so they know why.  There's a certain way to do things around here.  @@@.  Um anything else that you guys need for sure?

SECOND PERSON S614
No that's it.  Let’s just see the medications that are.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah I'll make sure your meds are all refilled before.

SECOND PERSON S614
Oh I don't think he needs any blood work.  He's had it not too long ago.  I think the last time he was here he had blood work done.

PATIENT S614
The only medications that bother me is the one that put me in the hospital.

SECOND PERSON S614
But you're not on it any more.

PATIENT S614
Fish oil is working fine, take the fish oil twice a day.

SECOND PERSON S614
But we don't know what it's doing to your cholesterol.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah I will make sure @@@.  

SECOND PERSON S614
So would it be helpful if we constricted that leg a little bit, like put a band on it?

DOCTOR S614
@@@  Sometimes what happens when the blood slows down in the leg it sometimes puts a force.

SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S614
Any time there’s infection, not infection, inflammation, it can make it, we want everything to keep moving.

SECOND PERSON S614
To keep yeah.

DOCTOR S614
In that area.

SECOND PERSON S614
So keeping his leg up.

DOCTOR S614
Oh yeah, yeah, those are all good things um.  Let me see here.

SECOND PERSON S614
It's not too swollen.

PATIENT S614
Why are my legs this color though?  What causes that?  I mean it's uh.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah it's usually um the veins in there that aren't, that aren't working as good as they once did.

PATIENT S614
They're not pumping.

DOCTOR S614
Um and it's just what we call venous insufficiency.  The veins aren't, the veins all have little valves in them so that when you pump the blood up here and when it comes to the top it hits the valve and it pumps it keeps, them, and it's just that over time, especially if somebody's had diabetes or some sort of leg insult those valves don't work as good and they're not like.

PATIENT S614
They're not.

DOCTOR S614
They're not like heart valves.

PATIENT S614
The motor's not right.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah exactly.

SECOND PERSON S614
In the legs.

DOCTOR S614
It tends to stay down in the leg and that's when you get the swelling a little bit and then also it can become discolored a little bit.  That's why you also lost hair down there, not as hairy as you once were.

PATIENT S614
@@@ hairy legs.

DOCTOR S614
Alright.

PATIENT S614
I need hair up here too. The arms.

DOCTOR S614
Um around February we checked everything so probably what I would say is next time when you come in, before you come to the clinic, just stop by the Lab and we'll check your cholesterol again, it'll be about six months then.

SECOND PERSON S614
That would be uh fasting?

DOCTOR S614
Yes.

SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.  They'll want you to fast.

DOCTOR S614
That's true so it might be, anytime you’re in for a morning appointment.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah for sure.

DOCTOR S614
Stop by the Lab.

PATIENT S614
If I get up in the morning and try to get my car to drive or something without anything in my system, forget it.

DOCTOR S614
Right.

PATIENT S614
I'm gonna have something, even if it.

SECOND PERSON S614
We might.

PATIENT S614
Just a slice of toast.

SECOND PERSON S614
When we go to the cardiologist, perhaps we could have that cholesterol checked through him which is easier for us to do early in the morning.

DOCTOR S614
Uh-huh.  Yeah that's fine if you bring it in as long as we have a record of it.  Um.

PATIENT S614
Something.

DOCTOR S614
That's not a big problem yeah I don't think there's anything else that we need to check.  Alright, anything I didn't talk about that you need me to go over?  Let me talk with my supervising doctor a few moments and we can get this show on the road.

SECOND PERSON S614
Anything else?

DOCTOR S614
Do you see an eye doctor or foot doctor?  Oh it looks like you saw the foot doctor in December.

SECOND PERSON S614
Foot doctor we see outside of the clinic and actually the eye doctor was recent but we're going to stop going here too.  We're gonna start going outside.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.  That’s find, as long as anything that I mean.

SECOND PERSON S614
@@@.

DOCTOR S614
If you're telling me that is fine, I'm going to take your word for it but remember we're going to document what you say.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
And we have to say that @@@.

PATIENT S614
Yes.

DOCTOR S614
Those are just things we just have to check every year so, so that we get reimbursed or the clinic gets reimbursed.

SECOND PERSON S614
Right and we understand.

DOCTOR S614
Um, alright.  I'll be right back.

SECOND PERSON S614
Alright, thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  74:04  DOCTOR IN:  80:34)

DOCTOR S614
Alright it looks good.  One, the only thing that she was saying is that if you continue to have these symptoms, even after switching these medications around from the nighttime to the daytime.  Uh we may want to recheck an echo, that's the ultrasound of the heart just to make sure there's nothing new going on with the heart and it's causing you to feel this.  Generally it wouldn't be something that would only happen during the mornings if it were the heart but it'd be something that you'd notice throughout the day.  Um but that's like the next kind of step @@@ we okay.

SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.

DOCTOR S614
Um any other questions, concerns?

PATIENT S614
No.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.  

PATIENT S614
Everything seems to be okay, I'm still above ground.

DOCTOR S614
You're still above.

SECOND PERSON S614
So I just uh, give me some directions, I'll write down what we're supposed to do.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah, so what I would do.

SECOND PERSON S614
Change the.

DOCTOR S614
Just change as little as possible by switching.

SECOND PERSON S614
So write here.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah so um atenolol which is @@@.

SECOND PERSON S614
To the a.m.

DOCTOR S614
To the a.m. and.

PATIENT S614
Is that the green one?

SECOND PERSON S614
No it's the little white one you take at night.

PATIENT S614
Oh.

DOCTOR S614
And uh.

SECOND PERSON S614
Take that in the.

PATIENT S614
Oh it looks like the water pill.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah, we're gonna put that in the morning with the water pill.  Then the half a pill.

DOCTOR S614
Right.

SECOND PERSON S614
You're gonna take at night.

PATIENT S614
The one you break?

SECOND PERSON S614
The one we break in half.

PATIENT S614
That goes at night.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah we're switching those around.

DOCTOR S614
Well yeah you'll still get good blood pressure control throughout the day.

SECOND PERSON S614
And then you take the orange pill three times a day again.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah no I would do that just until.  If you notice low blood pressures then we can change that around.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
And I'm thinking over the next couple visits, probably the next visit, we'll talk about switching the.  How much is that dose again.

SECOND PERSON S614
Hydralazine?  I think it's 10.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON S614
Is it 10mg?

DOCTOR S614
So maybe the next time, I mean I don't want to switch everything all at once.

SECOND PERSON S614
No.

DOCTOR S614
Cause it gets confusing.  So maybe the next time we can talk about taking that off and going up on some of the other stuff cause there's room to go on the fosinopril the half a tab.

SECOND PERSON S614
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S614
We can always go to a full tab.  So we can do that next time.

SECOND PERSON S614
Sometimes he gets little tremors, little shaky but I don't know if that has anything to do with any of the medications that he's taking it might just be his demeanor at the time you know he gets a little angry and just.

PATIENT S614
Like yesterday.

SECOND PERSON S614
He gets shaky.

DOCTOR S614
Uh yeah I don't know.  You're on a lot of different medications.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
But you know that um. You’re on a lot of medications, you know that.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
@@@

PATIENT S614
First things @@@.

DOCTOR S614
Right, so let me know if that gets worse and we can start looking into stuff and we can start taking stuff off and putting stuff back on.

PATIENT S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
And the goals of all this, I mean are obviously to get you on as few of pills as possible.  It's gonna take a little bit of time.  It's a lot easier to throw a bunch of pills.

SECOND PERSON S614
Oh sure.

PATIENT S614
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON S614
Sure.

DOCTOR S614
Than take them off okay.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

DOCTOR S614
Alright so we'll see you back in like three to four months again and make sure that this has gotten better.

PATIENT S614
Make it four months.

DOCTOR S614
Okay.

SECOND PERSON S614
Well but in the meantime we should be hearing from Audiology and the GI Clinic.

DOCTOR S614
So take that up to the clerk at the front up here.

SECOND PERSON S614
Okay.

DOCTOR S614
And they'll try to schedule those appointments right now.

SECOND PERSON S614
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S614
Just so that we know you can get in okay.

SECOND PERSON S614
Alright.

PATIENT S614
We had some wind damage.

DOCTOR S614
When it was all crazy windy, past month.

PATIENT S614
It messed up our patio door.

SECOND PERSON S614
On the patio door.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.

PATIENT S614
The adjuster came @@@ gazebo, rebuilt it myself.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yesterday.

PATIENT S614
Got up on the roof, found a couple shingles loose, to make a long story short.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.

PATIENT S614
We have a thousand deductible and it came to $950 to buy a new patio door.

SECOND PERSON S614
Have it installed.

PATIENT S614
And he said because @@@ call this claim in and they'll readjust.

DOCTOR S614
Then.

PATIENT S614
I said to myself, you know I'm not a highly educated but I’m street smart.

SECOND PERSON S614
@@@.

PATIENT S614
Once I take that check and sign it. And I go back @@@

SECOND PERSON S614
You're not gonna get it.

PATIENT S614
@@@.  So we went shopping.  A heavier door costs lots of money, $3000 so I called him back and I said way out of line so he's gonna come to see us @@@.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah.

PATIENT S614
@@@.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah.

PATIENT S614

SECOND PERSON S614
So he got a little aggravated yesterday.

PATIENT S614
And then I took it out on her.

SECOND PERSON S614
Yeah and we were leaving the house and coming out of the garage and our neighbor happened to pull up and said I hear you two, she heard him yelling so loud.

PATIENT S614
We can fight, all the years. Thank you doc.

DOCTOR S614
Alright you have a nice @@@.

SECOND PERSON S614
You have a nice day.  That's right we won't see you now.

DOCTOR S614
Yeah I was going to tell you that.

SECOND PERSON S614

DOCTOR S614

PATIENT S614
