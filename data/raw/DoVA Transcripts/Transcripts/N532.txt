PATIENT N532
Hmm.

DOCTOR N532

PATIENT N532
So when I feel like taking it.

DOCTOR N532
Exactly.

PATIENT N532
I don't feel like it tomorrow.

DOCTOR N532
That's okay.  A couple more.

PATIENT N532
Yeah.  Well it could be closer to the next appointment.

DOCTOR N532
It really doesn't matter.

PATIENT N532
@@@.

DOCTOR N532
Do it, yeah.  As long as you're taking your medicine I don't mind.

PATIENT N532
Right.  As long as it's before the next appointment.

DOCTOR N532
Correct, yeah.

PATIENT N532
Do you think it'd be best to have it as close to the next appointment as possible?

DOCTOR N532
I will get it whenever you get it done.

PATIENT N532
Right.

DOCTOR N532
If you get it done sooner, I'll take a look at it.  You want to be in the record before the next visit, I'll look at it then.

PATIENT N532
Yes.

DOCTOR N532
You see what I'm saying?

PATIENT N532
Yes.

DOCTOR N532
So either way I'll take a look at it.

PATIENT N532
And so it doesn't make any difference really.

DOCTOR N532
Right.

PATIENT N532
As long as it's before the next appointment.

DOCTOR N532
Correct.

PATIENT N532
Yeah.

DOCTOR N532
So you seem to be doing well.

PATIENT N532
@@@.

DOCTOR N532
You seem to be doing well.  I'm going to visit with my attending and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT N532

DOCTOR N532

PATIENT N532
Alright.

DOCTOR N532
You can have a seat wherever you would like.

(DOCTOR OUT:  31:41  DOCTOR IN:  36:50)

DOCTOR N532
Alright sir.  @@@.  

PATIENT N532
@@@.

DOCTOR N532
You know your weight has been stable.

PATIENT N532
Yes.

DOCTOR N532
You're still overweight.

PATIENT N532
Yeah.

DOCTOR N532
So I want you to go to this program we have called TeleMove.

PATIENT N532
@@@.

DOCTOR N532
Do you have a phone at home?

PATIENT N532
Yeah.

DOCTOR N532
So what you can do is you can call this number here.

PATIENT N532
Yeah.

DOCTOR N532
And this is a program that we offer through the VA and it helps individuals to lose weight and to stay on track.

PATIENT N532
@@@.

DOCTOR N532
Helping people with diet and exercise.

PATIENT N532
Yeah.

DOCTOR N532
And it's something that kind of, you know keep talking to you about this and keeping an eye on it.  Are you interested in this?  I can give this to you.

PATIENT N532
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR N532
Okay.

PATIENT N532
Okay.  So I'm overweight.

DOCTOR N532
Yeah.

PATIENT N532
I'm not losing weight but I'm not gaining it.

DOCTOR N532
Correct and I think that it'll help your cholesterol and help with the other medicine if we'll try to see that you get a couple pounds off.

PATIENT N532
Right.

DOCTOR N532
And the wintertime is really a hard time for people to lose weight just because you're indoors a lot, all of the holidays, things like that.

PATIENT N532
Right, good.  Maybe I shouldn't eat as much hmm.

DOCTOR N532
Well I think it's not what you eat, it's just to watch the portion size.

PATIENT N532
Right.

DOCTOR N532
So.

PATIENT N532
And I don't want to be on those exercise machines.

DOCTOR N532
Well are you definitely, that’s why this is a really good resource cause they give you a lot of different options.

PATIENT N532
Hmm.

DOCTOR N532
And so they'll go through with you all of the things that you can do.

PATIENT N532
Right.

DOCTOR N532
So if you say oh no I don't want to exercise, she'll talk with you and help you out with that.

PATIENT N532
Right.

DOCTOR N532
Okay.

PATIENT N532
Okay.

DOCTOR N532
I will see you back in a couple of months.  We get a cholesterol drawn before you come in okay.

PATIENT N532
Right.

DOCTOR N532
So no rush on that.

PATIENT N532
Right. Cholesterol.  So you already ordered it so.

DOCTOR N532
