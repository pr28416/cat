DOCTOR X607
Did you feel?

PATIENT X607
I felt a little stick, like a stick.

DOCTOR X607
Okay.

PATIENT X607
It started feeling like I was having a heart attack, but it might have just been the light cycling.

DOCTOR X607
Okay.

PATIENT X607
But other than that, I continued on @@@.

DOCTOR X607
Um let's see your blood pressure is good today.  Are you taking all your blood pressure medicines regularly?

PATIENT X607
I haven't taken it yet.

DOCTOR X607
You haven't?

PATIENT X607
No.

DOCTOR X607
Okay.  Your blood pressure was fine uh right now.  You're not on a lot of blood pressure medicines, just the one.

PATIENT X607
@@@.

DOCTOR X607
That's fine um let's see.  And we checked your cholesterol back in January and it was okay.  Um when do you see the urology doctors next?  For the prostate?

PATIENT X607
I don't know.  I don't know.

DOCTOR X607
And you saw in October.  They just want to see you every uh.

PATIENT X607
Every six months I think.

DOCTOR X607
Every year.

PATIENT X607
Every year, oh that’s great, that's fine.

DOCTOR X607
So that's good so you're fine for a while.

PATIENT X607
That’s fine.

DOCTOR X607
Um let's see.  So we checked, the last time you mentioned that your calcium was high when you had um, you had um gone to a community fair and they test your calcium in your urine or something.  Do you remember talking about that?  They checked um.

PATIENT X607
Yeah they did and they said it was a little high.

DOCTOR X607
And it was a little high um here but not too high, um just barely over um.  So they said it's just a tad high um in the blood.

PATIENT X607
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X607
And they checked um a few other things um and it looks like you have what's called hyperparathyroidism.  So you have the thyroid gland here, in your neck, and inside, kind of behind it, it's just there's these four small, they are like this big, they’re real soft.  

PATIENT X607
Hmm.

DOCTOR X607
Um there are four little glands behind the thyroid called the parathyroid um and that is something that, that's the gland that regulates the calcium in our bodies.

PATIENT X607
Okay.

DOCTOR X607
Okay and sometimes for whatever reason um this will, it just is overactive okay.  Um we can send you to the endocrine doctors to have them talk to you more to see if you can do something about it.  Do you want to do that?

PATIENT X607
Is it that severe?  I mean.

DOCTOR X607
Uh it's not real high.

PATIENT X607
Is it something I have to look at?

DOCTOR X607
It's not real high but it might be worth talking to them about it to see if they think.  You know they may just say follow it, there's nothing we could do right now.

PATIENT X607
Okay.

DOCTOR X607
But.

PATIENT X607
@@@.

DOCTOR X607
Why don't you have a seat up here?  Other than that I think everything else is pretty good here.  Um, you're not due for anything else right now.

PATIENT X607
No you know I got a little soreness in there.

DOCTOR X607
Okay and that's where.

PATIENT X607
When they put this pacemaker in.

DOCTOR X607
Okay.

PATIENT X607
I don't know if it's from the pacemaker.

DOCTOR X607
It might be.

PATIENT X607
Or where it's lying or what.

DOCTOR X607
It may be the way that.

PATIENT X607
If it's kind of laying on my back.

DOCTOR X607
You know it may be the way you're lying now and you know if you're kind of.

PATIENT X607
