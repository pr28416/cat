Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR F237
PATIENT? 

PATIENT F237
Hi doc, how you doing?

DOCTOR F237
Actually @@@ right?

PATIENT F237
Well I think it's a little more than that doc.  I guess you’ll figure all that out.

DOCTOR F237
Isn't that why you called?

PATIENT F237
Yeah the ankle and from here to the ankle.

DOCTOR F237
Okay, let's take off the shoes and look at both of them.  Tell me what happened.

PATIENT F237
I don't know.  Uh you know I’ve been getting swelling in these ankles and in the ankle for a while but I'll ice it and it'll go down.  I injured it in the military and it never really healed.  When I was in the Army I had a cast on it.

DOCTOR F237
You said this has been going on ten years or something?

PATIENT F237
Uh.

DOCTOR F237
So what's the deal here?

PATIENT F237
You know it was off and on.  If I twisted it or something usually but since the last couple of months.

DOCTOR F237
Alright so the last couple of months.

PATIENT F237
It’s been swelling more and not going down.

DOCTOR F237
Last couple months having more swelling.  And pain or just swelling?

PATIENT F237
Well it was just swelling there, for the past three weeks.

DOCTOR F237
@@@, last three weeks.

PATIENT F237
And a coloration change.

DOCTOR F237
In the last three weeks with a color change and some pain.

PATIENT F237
No, not some pain, it's a sharp like pin sticking pain.

DOCTOR F237
Oh oh.  You got diabetes?

PATIENT F237
Yeah diabetes.

DOCTOR F237
Like needles?

PATIENT F237
Yeah.

DOCTOR F237
@@@

PATIENT F237
Worse at night?
It's also worse throughout the day and I'm having numbness too in the area.

DOCTOR F237
Since I'm not your doctor so I don't know your background but it could be that your diabetes is getting worse.

PATIENT F237
Yeah much worse.

DOCTOR F237
And you're having so alright. How do I explain this?  So you got some nerves right.  This is your leg right.  You have arteries and you have nerves right.  These are the nerves.  What do you think the nerves do right?

PATIENT F237
Probably sensation yeah.

DOCTOR F237
Sensation that's one.

PATIENT F237
@@@.

DOCTOR F237
One is moving them right.

PATIENT F237
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F237
And some of the nerves go up to the arteries all right.  So there's nerves going everywhere right.  So with the diabetes your circulation isn't great.

PATIENT F237
Right.

DOCTOR F237
Alright.  The less controlled you are the blood it's not circulating very well.  That's why they want you to check your blood pressure.  That's why they want that.  You don't have that, you're gonna have disease.  What's gonna happen, you're gonna have venous stasis, this chronic lower extremity edema and that's in relation like if somebody's not controlling themselves they're going to have ugly looking legs.

PATIENT F237
Right.

DOCTOR F237
You know when it gets all red and scaly.

PATIENT F237
Uh-huh.  @@@.

DOCTOR F237
And then there's more that do control themselves, they don't get that so.  Every time that kind of shows this @@@ control that kind of thing.  The nerves they need to nutrition.  It's just like how your muscles need nutrition to move so if your nerves have poor circulation to them they start getting damage and that's where the pins and needles and numbness, so they're getting damaged.  Why because the circulation is bad.  Why is the circulation bad, because of the diabetes @@@.  Some of that is irreversible.  Once we get to that point there is no more going back, so you just damaged it you know.  So the only hope is try to prevent it from getting worse and try to control your sugars.  So let me see how your sugars have been.

PATIENT F237
Yeah.

DOCTOR F237
Like I say I'm not your doctor so I have no idea of your history so on June 8th you were 8% which is not good.  Do you know what your A1c is?

PATIENT F237
I had another one at Advocate health fair and it was 7.4.

DOCTOR F237
And that was when?

PATIENT F237
That was one month ago, July they had that.

DOCTOR F237
They did a spot check?

PATIENT F237
No they took blood.  They took blood, sent it to a lab and sent me the results back within about two weeks.

DOCTOR F237
So 7.5.  So you've been averaging about 169 fasting glucose for the last three months.

PATIENT F237
Usually they're 166.

DOCTOR F237
So then with an 8 on June 15th you were averaging like 180 fasting.  So it's not very well controlled.

PATIENT F237
But I haven't been able to exercise cause @@@.  I used to just ride a bike @@@.

DOCTOR F237
Have you been taking your insulin?

PATIENT F237
I been taking insulin.

DOCTOR F237
And have you been watching what you eat?

PATIENT F237
Now I can't say I've been watching greatly but I have been yes watching it.

DOCTOR F237
What have your uh, what has your fasting glucose been like in the morning.  Like this morning what was it?  Do you check it every morning?

PATIENT F237
Oh yeah. This morning I was rushing and didn’t check it, I usually try to check it every morning but I'm usually in the 120s and many times lower in the morning.

DOCTOR F237
What was it yesterday?

PATIENT F237
Uh yesterday it was 119 yesterday.

DOCTOR F237
Okay.  

PATIENT F237
I have, like I say, I'll get up into the high 120s sometimes.  It's just the way.

DOCTOR F237
What's the highest it's ever been?

PATIENT F237
In the mornings 137 I believe it was.  Over this last couple of months.

DOCTOR F237
Yeah that A1c that you got from @@@ was like 130s, 120s you know.

PATIENT F237
It's during the day I think that it spikes on me pretty bad.  Uh I've had lows in the middle of the night uh when they first gave me that Aspart, then I'd have to get up and I'd have to drink something, some sugary drink or get some hard candy and I noticed that affects me when I take my morning sugar.  Uh but and I'm not eating much in the morning.  Yeah but when I eat.

DOCTOR F237
It doesn't help yeah.  For diabetics, like for other people it doesn't matter but for diabetics, it's more important that you eat every day at the same time.

PATIENT F237
Yes but what I do at my job.  But I eat; I may have dinner at 10-10:30 a night.  I think that affects me because of the way I work.

DOCTOR F237
What do you do?

PATIENT F237
Uh I do network stuff and I work odd hours, depends on when I'm called and what I'm doing.

DOCTOR F237
But think about it if you eat late and then you go to bed late.

PATIENT F237
Yeah.

DOCTOR F237
You know.

PATIENT F237
I think that's one of the main problems right there.  I've got this, I'm trying to change jobs right and I change what I do to get expanded out but I find myself eating @@@ constant now and I told my other doctor the same thing.  I mean I got to work and that sort of work is not really four or five almost is,@@@ there but never that late and I know that's the problem.  

DOCTOR F237
You didn't hurt your leg, like you didn't have trauma.

PATIENT F237

DOCTOR F237

PATIENT F237
Uh.

DOCTOR F237
That's for a diabetic otherwise there's nothing else then.

PATIENT F237

DOCTOR OUT:  28:10   DOCTOR IN:  35:42

DOCTOR F237
Alright sir.  So I'll have you come back in a week to visit the nurse and see if that infection is looking better, so I'll have come back for a nurse visit in one week and then I think we need to see you, just to see your primary care physician.  So I know you take a bath every day but I'm gonna try to mark it and see if you can try to avoid cleaning the markers off so when the nurse sees you in a week she can see if that redness has gone down, right in here.

PATIENT F237
Yeah.  All I take is a shower uh.

DOCTOR F237
Just kind of dab around it and try to avoid @@@.

PATIENT F237
Getting the water on it.

DOCTOR F237
Yeah or at least washing the marker so we can see if um.

PATIENT F237
So what I need to do is wash around that area.

DOCTOR F237

PATIENT F237
Yeah.  All around the bone area.

DOCTOR F237
Okay.

PATIENT F237

DOCTOR F237
Yeah.

PATIENT F237
Alcohol would take it off at the end of the day.

DOCTOR F237
Alright.  @@@.

PATIENT F237
Let me ask you a question, if you get @@@ stand in here this is a skin infection you say?

DOCTOR F237
Yeah.  It's called cellulitis.

PATIENT F237
That's exactly the area where the pins sticking me.

DOCTOR F237
Oh yeah.  

PATIENT F237
Okay that's why I can see.

DOCTOR F237
And uh cellulitis is not like cellulitis on you see on girl's butt or anything.

PATIENT F237
There on the rear.

DOCTOR F237
So it's basically inflammation of the underlying area of the skin.

PATIENT F237
So what am I supposed to do?

DOCTOR F237
You're gonna pick up Keflex antibiotic and gabapentin, I'm gonna start you on a low dose alright.  @@@.  Do have your doctor, you're real doctor @@@ put you on a higher dose based on your symptoms and titrate it a little bit up.

PATIENT F237
The gabapentin?

DOCTOR F237

DOCTOR F237
No like I know that it's at the window and then you tell them at the window make the changes to mail it that you have to go someplace, you know what I mean.

PATIENT F237
Okay, yeah.  Could I have been bitten by something also?

DOCTOR F237
Well this is another thing sometimes yes it could be spider bites.

PATIENT F237
Yeah because I had rats and I had to have the house fumigated.  

DOCTOR F237
Right.

PATIENT F237
White spiders.

DOCTOR F237
But the most common reason might be because of that fungus.

PATIENT F237
Fungus yeah okay.

DOCTOR F237
And because you're a diabetic.  The likelihood of it being spider bites is really low.

PATIENT F237
Okay.  @@@ anything you know @@@.

DOCTOR F237
Oh of cellulitis?

PATIENT F237
No the uh.

DOCTOR F237
Fungus?  @@@  So I won’t give you medication for the fungus for now, I want to treat the infection first.

PATIENT F237
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F237
And then once everything starts resolving you should definitely 
bring it up with your primary care physician.

PATIENT F237
Okay.

DOCTOR F237

DOCTOR F237
No pasta, spaghetti and noodles and the white rice.

PATIENT F237
Okay.

DOCTOR F237
So no chicken fried rice from you know a Chinese restaurant.  So do that for this week so your sugar is being monitored because I want you to take that insulin because your body's like whoa I'm not having carbs and that insulin really works too well alright so you've got to be careful.

PATIENT F237
Okay.

DOCTOR F237
You need to understand what I'm saying cause if you're avoiding the bad stuff your sugars will start getting lower.

PATIENT F237
I'm gonna have to adjust the insulin.

DOCTOR F237
Yes exactly.

PATIENT F237
So if I eat more of the vegetables.

DOCTOR F237
Yes, if you have any steaks boom.  Um green beans.

PATIENT F237
