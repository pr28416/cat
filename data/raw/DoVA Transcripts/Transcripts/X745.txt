PATIENT X745
No problem, I can work with that.

DOCTOR X745
Um, let's see what else.  Do you smoke?

PATIENT X745
@@@, I do.

DOCTOR X745
Do you want to stop?

PATIENT X745
I'm trying.  I smoke maybe a half a pack a day?

DOCTOR X745
Okay.

PATIENT X745
I need to quit.

DOCTOR X745
Okay.

PATIENT X745
Cause it's not good for my high blood pressure.

DOCTOR X745
It's not good period.

PATIENT X745
Period.  I got to take heed, doc, as of this day I'm gonna.  I don't want no gum.  What you think?  They gave me some gum but.

DOCTOR X745
I think every person is different.

PATIENT X745
I know, I uh.

DOCTOR X745
And your, let's just lay it all out and let's be perfectly honest with you.

PATIENT X745
Thank you, I would like to be.

DOCTOR X745
So smoking has probably been the least of your issues as far as substance abuse in general.

PATIENT X745
That's correct.

DOCTOR X745
Okay.

PATIENT X745
That's correct.

DOCTOR X745
Um so if you are still smoking a little bit, but you are no longer using cocaine?

PATIENT X745
Doing heroin no.

DOCTOR X745
Heroin.

PATIENT X745
No sir, no sir.

DOCTOR X745
What about alcohol?

PATIENT X745
No sir, never been a drinker.

DOCTOR X745
Good.

PATIENT X745
That, if I drink a beer, that lead me to get into heroin.  That's a gateway to go get that.

DOCTOR X745
Yeah.

PATIENT X745
Alcohol I have all day but I go get heroin.

DOCTOR X745
Yeah.

PATIENT X745
So I don't.

DOCTOR X745
So I mean in the short term, if smoking is a way for you to not use coke and not use heroin.

PATIENT X745
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X745
Then so be it but if you are done with that, it's over and it's no longer something that ever crosses your mind once in a while.

PATIENT X745
That doesn't cross, I was going through that crisis and that point, but wasn't no excuse for that cause the problem was still there.  We would have had to go through but I said what am I doing, so now I just, abstain, don't go around no people place and things and I been doing good doctor.  I been doing good.

DOCTOR X745
Now do you feel that that's where you're at then absolutely you should work on the smoking.  Um and you know it's different.  Some people they can just stop.

PATIENT X745
I know.  My sister stopped.

DOCTOR X745
But some people you know, the gum works, there are patches that work, there's you know just kind of drawing a line in the sand saying January 1st 2011 will be the day I quit.  I mean you're gonna have to find what that is for you.

PATIENT X745
And you know what doc, I'm gonna try.  I tried the gum but I was psyching myself out.  That gum helped me listen, I chewed two pieces, three pieces I put in my mouth.

DOCTOR X745
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X745
And that whole day I didn't smoke until later on that night.  I went about nine hours so it must be working to get my mind to say don’t get one.  I smoked a couple puffs and it didn't taste right.

DOCTOR X745
Good.

PATIENT X745
So see I think that gum might work for me.

DOCTOR X745
Well that's good.  I mean.

PATIENT X745
Yeah so we gonna work together doctor cause I got to quit.  I'm 55; I'll be 56 next year.  I'm not getting any younger.

DOCTOR X745
Okay.

PATIENT X745
And that's when the body needs to stop drinking and drugging.  I drug, but things start happening if you take it and I haven't used since that day and I thank God, just for the day now, one day at a time, you know how it go.  So doctor I'm doing great and I really think me being of service to my country is helping me cause if not I don't know what I would be.  I smoke though, this is it.  You know this is my start and I'm doing something for me.  I'm making the initial steps, you all are helping me, willing to help me but I got a.  I'm my worst enemy so I realize that.

DOCTOR X745
And best friend.

PATIENT X745
And best friend, so now I'm my best friend.

DOCTOR X745

PATIENT X745
Yeah a long time.

DOCTOR X745
Yeah.

PATIENT X745
I thought it was from that hernia but they say the hernia repair is good.

Now I come to my sense I say by the way you're doing, I be talking to myself but I ain't gonna answer myself.  I say what do you want, so I went through some change, went to prison, I'm keeping it real, went to ask me what am I doing.  I did what I did; I took my wait, now it's in the past.  I'm not gonna let the records of my past dictate my future.

DOCTOR X745
Good.

PATIENT X745
That’s a concept that stays with you.

DOCTOR X745
Good.

PATIENT X745
And I got God in my life, not preaching to you, I'm preaching to me, to do what's right today.  That's just how I do it doc.

DOCTOR X745
Good.

PATIENT X745
In six months, you’re going to see, my apartment.  I'm gonna continue to walk by faith.  All I got to do is do what's right.  If I do what's right doc, God put people in your path, they help you.  I realize now.  Thank you doc.

DOCTOR X745
Okay.  See you later.

PATIENT X745
I'll see you again.

DOCTOR X745
Alright.

PATIENT X745

DOCTOR X745
Yeah.

PATIENT X745
