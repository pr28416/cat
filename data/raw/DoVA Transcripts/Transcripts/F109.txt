Good, good.  Sorry I think got scheduled to the wrong clinic today.

PATIENT F109
Whoa oh.

DOCTOR F109
@@@ on Thursday.

PATIENT F109
Yeah I usually come in on Thursdays.

DOCTOR F109
Yeah so that's what was going on today.  They mis-scheduled a bunch of people.  Um I went through your chart and it looks like you were supposed to have your cholesterol and your labs done but you haven't had them done.

PATIENT F109
Right.

DOCTOR F109
Um why didn't you go up to get your labs done?

PATIENT F109
Nobody ever told me to go and get them done.

DOCTOR F109
Um back in July when they saw you they asked you to come back in two days and get your labs done.

PATIENT F109
I got them done back in July.

DOCTOR F109
Okay cause I looked at them and I didn't see any.  I think I'll just check one more time.

PATIENT F109
Last time I was here yeah.

DOCTOR F109
I saw the last one in June but not from July yeah.  So they weren't done since June.

PATIENT F109
Okay then that was, they only told me to go one time.

DOCTOR F109
Yeah.

PATIENT F109
Okay so @@@.

DOCTOR F109
You're just here for a follow-up appointment?

PATIENT F109
A follow-up plus I'm having some problems.

DOCTOR F109
Okay what's your problems?

PATIENT F109
Okay uh my I've got a toe on my, I guess I need to be referred to Podiatry.  I've got a toe on my right foot that if I don't work on it at least every three or four days I can barely walk.

DOCTOR F109
Does it hurt?

PATIENT F109
Yes.

DOCTOR F109
Is it ingrown?

PATIENT F109
No it's the nail when it starts to grow out.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.  Take a seat up here and let me take a look at you.

PATIENT F109
Ever since '79 in the snow.  I was out in the snow and the nail turned black and it never.

DOCTOR F109
Okay which toe is it?

PATIENT F109
It's next to the baby toe.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.

PATIENT F109
So I don't know what toe that is.

DOCTOR F109
Let me look.

PATIENT F109
But that's why of course back in June I told them that it felt like had pulled a muscle in my elbow or something.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
And it was hard for me to lift but I had an elastic band on my elbow.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
And now if I don't put a band around my elbow I can't lift any more than about four or five pounds and it feels like the tendon is about to tear from the bone or something.

DOCTOR F109
Your blood pressure looks good.  Okay let me see.

PATIENT F109
This toe.  There's a big callus here and when this nail grows out I can barely walk.  

DOCTOR F109
It hurts?

PATIENT F109
It does when it grows out if I don't work on it like every two or three days it's unbearable.  And then I've got a question.  I've been working for, I guess, about the last month removing mold and painting a basement.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
And the past week I've been really out of breath and my chest has been hurting.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
I guess from the fumes whatever. 

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
Is there anything I could put like in a.

DOCTOR F109
So you're being @@@ basement?

PATIENT F109
Yeah well they had water damage so I tore out all the mold and redid this stuff and I've been painting and cleaning and stuff and I guess the fumes just might, like I say for about the last week my chest has been hurting and I been out of breath so I thought maybe if there's something I could put on the inhaler or something that.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.

PATIENT F109
Maybe.

DOCTOR F109
Okay so does your chest pain only occur while you're getting short of breath?  How does it happen?

PATIENT F109
No I can, I mean I get short of breath now, some like just now bending over uh.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
And this is so back in June I was getting out of breath and if I go to exercise or do sit-ups or stuff I get dizzy.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
Okay I thought that was the blood work was to find out if something was wrong there but now it's uh like I'll go to sleep at night and all of a sudden I start having real bad chest pains.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
Or I'll get up and.

DOCTOR F109
How long has this been going on for?

PATIENT F109
This is, the chest pain for about a week now.

DOCTOR F109
A week okay and how long have you been working in the basement for?

PATIENT F109
Uh about a month, month and a half.

DOCTOR F109
And I saw that you were using cocaine.  Have you used any recently?

PATIENT F109
No.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.  When was your last use?

PATIENT F109
Uh probably June or July.

DOCTOR F109
June to July okay.

PATIENT F109
About that time.

DOCTOR F109
Cause you with cocaine usage it can actually cause heart attacks.

PATIENT F109
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F109
So.

PATIENT F109
But this doesn't feel like a heart attack, it's almost like somebody punched me in the chest.  It's like; it feels like I'm having pain in my lungs.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
You know I thought maybe if I got an inhaler and maybe put some Vicks on there or something.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
That I can inhaler could.

DOCTOR F109
Uh does the pain occur while you're sleeping?

PATIENT F109
Sometimes it's while sleeping, sometimes I walk to the store and all of a sudden my chest will start hurting.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.  How long does it last for?

PATIENT F109
Uh maybe oh half hour, hour.

DOCTOR F109
Half hour and you have problems breathing while that happens?

PATIENT F109
Yeah I get short of breath but you know sometimes I can.

DOCTOR F109
@@@.

PATIENT F109
Cough and some white stuff will come out you know and then it feels better.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.

PATIENT F109
So I thought maybe I'd inhaled too much paint or too much of the chemicals I was using to get off the.

DOCTOR F109
Does anything make it better, the pain?

PATIENT F109
Uh fresh air.

DOCTOR F109
Fresh air okay and then does anything uh make it worse?

PATIENT F109
When I get too hot, you know the apartment's too hot.

DOCTOR F109
Does exercising make it worse or better?

PATIENT F109
I haven't been able to exercise cause I go to exercise and I get, I'm getting so dizzy.

DOCTOR F109
So @@@ pains you stop walking or do you keep walking?

PATIENT F109
Yeah, yeah I stop.

DOCTOR F109
Does the pain get better if you stop walking?

PATIENT F109
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR F109
And can you describe the pain?

PATIENT F109
It's as if somebody just took their fist and punched me in the chest and it's just real sore and it hurts you know.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.  Um and any nausea or sweating or anything like that?

PATIENT F109
Yeah I get nauseous.

DOCTOR F109
Did you have a stress test in the past?

PATIENT F109
I had a stress test I think back in June or July or something.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.  Was that normal?

PATIENT F109
Yeah.

DOCTOR F109
Oh okay good. Just going to check.

PATIENT F109
Excuse me.

DOCTOR F109
Oh that's okay.  How long have you been working on this basement for?

PATIENT F109
About a month, month and a half.

DOCTOR F109
Does if feel like the breathing is worse when you're working on it?

PATIENT F109
It I mean, you know I'm finishing up now but like I say the past week, it started about a week ago and then it started getting real bad and then I started wearing masks and I turned on a fan and opened all the windows so it's not as bad as it had gotten you know.

DOCTOR F109
Do you feel like your chest pain is associated with your problems breathing?

PATIENT F109
I think so.  You know what it kind of reminds me of once years ago uh back in the '70s when I was young I bought a building and I was trying to clean it up.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
And I made the mistake I didn't know, I mixed some alcohol and some bleach together, I mean uh some ammonia and some bleach.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
And I was cleaning with it and the fumes, I inhaled them and my chest started hurting and started @@@ and that's the type pain I feel you know when I have these little episodes.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.

PATIENT F109
That's why I was thinking maybe it was coming from me inhaling too many chemicals.  

DOCTOR F109
Hold on one second.  (Doctor makes a phone call to check on the patient's stress test not in the computer).  Okay.  No thoughts of hurting yourself or hurting others?

PATIENT F109
Huh?

DOCTOR F109
No thoughts of hurting yourself?

PATIENT F109
Oh no, no.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.  You're taking aspirin every day?

PATIENT F109
No.

DOCTOR F109
No?

PATIENT F109
No.

DOCTOR F109
Why not?

PATIENT F109
Uh because I wasn't told to take aspirin every day.

DOCTOR F109
You weren't?

PATIENT F109
No.

DOCTOR F109
Okay. (Doctor talking to person regarding echo report on phone)
Okay so good.  So the good news is your stress test was negative.  So I'm not too concerned that this is your heart.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

DOCTOR F109
And then can I have you sit up here while I type.  I want to take a listen to your lungs and heart okay.  Take a deep breath.  Keep your feet here.  Okay great.  Okay.  And about your elbow what did you mention first about your elbow?

PATIENT F109
Right through here.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
It's like the muscle or something like that when I lift.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
It feels like it's coming lose.  I can't lift anything.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.

PATIENT F109
So I got it real tight in that one space and I wrap it and I can't even lift a five pound bag of @@@.

DOCTOR F109
Okay.

PATIENT F109
And it's been like this since I guess about May or June.

DOCTOR F109
Squeeze my fingers for me.  Squeeze as tight as you can.  Good.  Make two fists; go like this, good stop.  Now go like this.  Okay good.  You've got really good strength in your arm.  I'm not sure why you're not able to lift things.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

DOCTOR F109
Because I mean when I'm testing right now, you're really strong compared to other people that I know.  So it may be it's just you feel like you're a little bit weaker but you feel really strong.  I'm not sure what the problem is.

PATIENT F109
Yeah but when I, let’s say if I grab @@@.

DOCTOR F109
Does it lock?

PATIENT F109
No if I go to lift something like this, in fact this pops out like that.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
And then I have to drop it.  It's something right through here.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.  Cause you have really good strength when I'm pushing down on your arm, I think having stronger muscles @@@ now right.  I wouldn't be too concerned about it.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

DOCTOR F109
I'm gonna be right back.

PATIENT F109
Okay.  Now should I go to the Lab when I leave here?

DOCTOR F109
Uh yeah probably.  I'll be right back okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  73:49  DOCTOR IN:  84:00)

SECOND DOCTOR F109
PATIENT?

PATIENT F109
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT F109
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Um tell me about this chest pain.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
What does it feel like, sharp, dull, stabbing, pressure?

PATIENT F109
It's uh dull.  It's kind of like I just get hit in the chest you know.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
And it goes away and I feel sore for a while.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
How long does it usually last you?

PATIENT F109
It lasts maybe half hour to an hour and then it goes away and my chest stays sore for a while but the actual pain itself, @@@ but it stays sore for maybe another hour or so and then it goes away.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
What are you usually doing when you get the chest pain?

PATIENT F109
Uh when it first started I'd be painting or spraying you know removing mold, whatever I was doing @@@ you know.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
And uh the past week it's it usually occurs when I'm at the house and you know most time it happens at night when windows are closed, my apartment gets too warm the pain will hit me again or if I walk to the store, walking back sometimes the pain will hit me.  Um you know I thought that perhaps I just inhaled too many fumes and too much paint and too much boric acid.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
You know bleach and stuff that I was using to clean all this mold and stuff you know so you know the pain is gradually getting better, it's not hurting as much but I thought maybe I could put something in a vaporizer or something and help clean whatever it is out.  A lot of times it hurts and I'll start coughing you know and you know phlegm or something will come up.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Well does the shortness of breath start first or chest pain start first?

PATIENT F109
The shortness of breath I get now, I assume that was from just being fat but the shortness of breath has gotten worse since this started but uh I've had the shortness of breath now for I guess six, seven months.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.  Uh so what I am saying is that when you walk to the store and back you get short of breath first and then get chest pain or do you get chest pain first and then get short of breath?

PATIENT F109
The shortness of breath came first.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
The shortness of breath comes first.

PATIENT F109
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Okay.  So you're short of breath and then you get chest pain and then you rest.

PATIENT F109
Right, right.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
And it gets better.

PATIENT F109
Right uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Um does the pain move anywhere?

PATIENT F109
No it's like basically right in the middle of my chest.

SECONE DOCTOR F109
And you feel like you can't breathe in deep or that doesn't happen?

PATIENT F109
If I breathe in deep and it hurts more, sometimes I'll take a big breath.

DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
You know what I'm saying, as deep as I can take and then I'll start coughing and choking and stuff will come up.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Are you using cocaine?  When was the last time you used?

PATIENT F109
No.  The last time I used was I think back in June.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Alright.  We need some blood tests today and I also want a urine sample okay.  You did not give us one back in July; you need to give us one today okay.

PATIENT F109
Yeah okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Um you know you had that stress test.  It was a good stress test that you had done back in August or July or whenever it was a few months ago.  It did not show you had any blockages in your heart that we can see.

PATIENT F109
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Uh it's not the best test for checking to see if you have blockages but it's the next best test.  The best test is to put a you know a catheter in your groin and go up into your heart and look, you know, an angiogram.  I think that at this point in time it's kind of a little bit invasive.

PATIENT F109
Yeah.
 
SECOND DOCTOR F109
Because it seems like I think this is more lung problem maybe than actually a cardiac heart problem.

PATIENT F109
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
So what we would like to do is we're gonna go ahead and start you on an inhaler and I want you to carry it around with you always and whenever you start getting short of breath I want you to use the inhaler.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Okay we're also going to get some blood tests done.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Are you a smoker too?

PATIENT F109
No.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Tobacco smoker?

PATIENT F109
No.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Ever?

PATIENT F109
No.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Never?

PATIENT F109
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Um have you had a chest x-ray recently here?

PATIENT F109
I might have had one last year or the year before.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
A year ago.

PATIENT F109
Also could you tell me how many, I know last year I had both the flu shots and this year last week I took the flu shot.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
@@@ one time, you've had the vaccine.

PATIENT F109
Yeah I know.  Have I had the pneumonia shot at all?

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Um usually we wait till you're 65 with the pneumonia shot.

PATIENT F109
Oh.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Unless you're having lung problems.

PATIENT F109
Oh okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
We're diagnosing now and if we find you have lung problems then we'll go ahead and give it to you.

PATIENT F109
Okay.  I'll just @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Well I mean, have you been working in carpentry or construction for years?

PATIENT F109
No this is like a sideline and then you know I've never had problems until you know I've been working on this one for about a month, month and a half.  You know I've been around a lot of different chemicals.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
And when did your um.

PATIENT F109
The pain just started last week.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
You know you may have had this thing for a long time, that’s why we had your stress test was done.
 
PATIENT F109
Okay, the pain I was having was chest pain was kind of related to my heart now it feels like it's my lungs because it's just like the pressure isn't over here.  Like before I was having it felt like something was popped loose and it pushed in against my heart.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Okay.

PATIENT F109
Now this feels like it's in the middle of my chest and my lungs.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Alright, we'll get a chest x-ray and we'll do the lung tests.  You can actually go upstairs and get the lung test today and do the blood work @@@ um.

PATIENT F109
Can I do it another time?

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Yeah you can come in whenever you want to do it @@@.  Uh we'll go ahead and get blood tests, get a urine sample today.  I don't want you to use any cocaine at all.  Have you used this drug before?

PATIENT F109
No.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Tobacco?

PATIENT F109
All I ever smoked was marijuana and cocaine.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Crack?

PATIENT F109
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
How much cocaine did you used to smoke?

PATIENT F109
I used to smoke uh during the day I'd smoke every day.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
But uh in the past I'd @@@ about five, six years I might of smoked maybe ten times in six years so.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
So before six years you were smoking every day?

PATIENT F109
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
For how many years?

PATIENT F109
Oh I almost @@@.  I smoked a little every day for probably 15 years, 10 years, something like that.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
Okay.  Um now cocaine actually, you know just like tobacco we tell people that can actually cause lung damage, cocaine actually causes lung damage in fewer smokes.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
So it’s actually quite bad.  Um we'll do the lung tests and then we'll see we'll go from there but the inhaler I want you to carry around and I want you to use it whenever you get short of breath and we'll see if your symptoms get better.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F109
We'll have you come back in about a month, two months, okay.

PATIENT F109
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR F109
Okay.  And you said you smoked cocaine for ten years or so?

PATIENT F109
I started smoking cocaine, I mean on a regular basis I was smoking for about ten years but I started smoking I think in about maybe 85.

FIRST DOCTOR F109
Okay.

PATIENT F109
85 probably until 2000 on a regular basis and then the last, then I started smoking like maybe once a month but the last five years has been like maybe twice a year.

FIRST DOCTOR F109
Okay.  And then before that when you said regularly was that daily?

PATIENT F109
Uh for ten years it was almost every day I smoked at least ten dollars’ worth.

FIRST DOCTOR F109
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F109
But uh then I went to every weekend that I smoked a couple of hundred dollars’ worth and then finally it got to kind of where I am now where I don't even think about smoking it.

FIRST DOCTOR F109
Okay.  So you're all set for your x-ray and your labs and then your lung function tests okay.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR F109
Um go ahead and go to your labs first and then go to your x-ray and then go to the lung function tests.  I would just ask them where the Pulmonary Lab is when you get your x-ray okay.  The Lab is across the hallway.  Once you're done with the labs you can go all the way down the hallway it's on the left hand side, it's X-Ray.

PATIENT F109
Okay now she said since I have to be here Wednesday morning anyway.

FIRST DOCTOR F109

PATIENT F109

FIRST DOCTOR F109
Sure that's fine too.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR F109
Okay um and then your albuterol inhaler, I prescribed it for you, let me see maybe I should change it so you could pick it up at the window.  You can go ahead and pick that up at the window okay.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR F109
And then we'll see you back actually pretty closely from now on okay.

PATIENT F109
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR F109
