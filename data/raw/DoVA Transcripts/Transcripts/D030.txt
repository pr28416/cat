Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR D030
Good to see you.

PATIENT D030
Isn't that cool?

DOCTOR D030
Are they @@@ you?  Okay.  How are things going?

PATIENT D030
Uh pretty good, pretty good.

DOCTOR D030
Okay um so you're that heart test that you did was normal.  The one where they, it was done at the end of January.

PATIENT D030
The echogram?

DOCTOR D030
Yeah.

PATIENT D030
That echogram.

DOCTOR D030
Yeah.

PATIENT D030
Yeah @@@ wanted to ask you @@@ his heart.

DOCTOR D030
Yeah.

PATIENT D030
So I got a pretty good heart and you know that's, you know I have a good heart @@@ muscle.

DOCTOR D030
Yeah.

PATIENT D030
Gets the blood everywhere.

DOCTOR D030
@@@ sure.  Any problems since I last saw you?

PATIENT D030
Uh no not really.  You know but one thing I'm really concerned about and @@@ I take my blood pressure at home occasionally.

DOCTOR D030
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D030
And sometime my heart race, it's up to like 52, is that kind of too low or?

DOCTOR D030
Well if you have any symptoms from it?  In terms of do you feel lightheaded at all?

PATIENT D030
No, no, I don't think so.

DOCTOR D030
Okay.  Um any.

PATIENT D030
But you know, I know you can look at my records uh in February I spent a couple of days in the hospital here because I did pass out.

DOCTOR D030
Right yeah.

PATIENT D030
But I think they agreed with me like I just got overheated.  I told them I got real hot and I just stopped and sat down and the next thing I know they were putting cold @@@ somebody and uh they said I was out for maybe a minute, not even a minute, you know just half a minute so.

DOCTOR D030
Yeah there's lots of reasons why you can um be, why you can pass out.  Sometimes it's you're heart but it's not always.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D030
So I would say, you know there was one time you were here when it was reported in the 50s but it looks like you're consistently you know in the 60s or 70s which is actually good.  It means the medication's working.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D030
That's what we want it to do , because the atenolol, that medication you're on protects your heart a little bit.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D030
So um.

PATIENT D030
Well I'm like on a half a tablet only right now.

DOCTOR D030
I know yeah and you're on a small dose, that's right.

PATIENT D030
Yeah right.

DOCTOR D030
So I would say just continue.  You know if it were to recur again then we'll look at and when it does happen.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D030
If at that time your heart rate is low then we would consider stopping it but I think.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D030
When it happens your heart rate wasn't that low so it means that it wasn't that low, so just continue it.

PATIENT D030
Okay, that's good, that's really good.

DOCTOR D030
@@@.  Um so the other thing I'm going to send you vitamin D pills.

PATIENT D030
Oh yeah, I was supposed to have that a long time but you know I just bought some and so I taking them, I think @@@ 800 units. 

DOCTOR D030
Oh you do.

PATIENT D030
Something like that.

DOCTOR D030
Okay.

PATIENT D030
@@@.

DOCTOR D030
Is it cheaper for you to buy them?

PATIENT D030
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR D030
Okay, okay.

PATIENT D030
I get 400 in a bottle @@@.

DOCTOR D030
Okay so what I want you to do is um stop, I'm going to send these other, these concentrated pills uh just cause your level was borderline low so to get your numbers back into the normal range.

PATIENT D030
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D030
And then we'll and then you could, so don't throw those pills that you have away.

PATIENT D030
Alright.

DOCTOR D030
But I'll these send you these and you just take it once a week.

PATIENT D030
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D030
For 12 weeks.

PATIENT D030
Don't take it with the other ones.

DOCTOR D030
Right just hold, put those aside for three months.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

DOCTOR D030
And then once you're done taking these once a week for 12 weeks.

PATIENT D030
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D030
Then start taking those.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

DOCTOR D030
Okay and it should, you know now that's it's sunny outside that'll help your Vitamin D.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D030
Help you.  I think all people who live in Chicago are Vitamin D deficient.

PATIENT D030
Yeah right.

DOCTOR D030
Um and otherwise no changes to any of your medications I think.  Your blood pressure looks good.  Your cholesterol is still at goal um.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D030
And then my only other question, you don't have a urology appointment until October right?

PATIENT D030
I don't know.  It's like once a year.  I don't know, I just wait until they call me.  It's only like a once a year basis now.

DOCTOR D030

PATIENT D030

DOCTOR D030
Okay so, oh my only other question is do you know when your, I know you've had a colonoscopy.  Do you remember what year it was?

PATIENT D030
Uh probably two years ago.

DOCTOR D030
Okay.

PATIENT D030
And I think they said I'm good for five years so.

DOCTOR D030
Okay.

PATIENT D030
This time they did find some polyps the first time but you know they werenâ€™t bad.

DOCTOR D030
Yeah and they take then out right then.

PATIENT D030
Right.

DOCTOR D030
So it's just the, yeah I don't know let me just make sure that there's no other.  We just checked your blood so I don't think there's anything for me to look at but hmm.  Do you have any questions for me?

PATIENT D030
Yes.  Well I have a question; I have something I would like for you to do for me.

DOCTOR D030
Sure.

PATIENT D030
I have to renew my handicapped sticker.  I have it because I have these arthritic knees and when I have to walk a long time, a long distance, it's like I'm only doing my walking in the day so I got a knee brace on to help me get up.  Uh it expired yesterday but I had, last time I was here I had the doctor fill out the form for me.  The Secretary of State wouldn't accept it because uh he put over here one year.

DOCTOR D030
Oh yeah.

PATIENT D030
See it's either permanent or six months and I have a permanent one.

DOCTOR D030
Do you have a new form or can I just @@@.

PATIENT D030
No, no, no.  They wouldn't let me change that.

DOCTOR D030
Okay.

PATIENT D030
So I got a new form, see I got already had a permanent when they did the @@@.

DOCTOR D030
Oh okay.

PATIENT D030
And uh I got a new form.

DOCTOR D030
Oh yeah let's do that then.

PATIENT D030
And they have to be filled out and they wouldn't accept this one because he put one year in there and I said what, can I just eliminate that?  I just is that what he said, probably just @@@.  And I @@@ handicapped @@@.

DOCTOR D030
Yeah.

PATIENT D030
You got to do all of this stuff and I see this was expired yesterday and I don't want to be getting no ticket for it.

DOCTOR D030
What did we put on the old one?

PATIENT D030
It's up here knee osteoarthritis is what they put.  Uh I don't know that it's terrible, I see that date of birth up here.  

DOCTOR D030
Oh sure.

PATIENT D030
Does it call for that?  

DOCTOR D030
This one is.

PATIENT D030
The one that says now that's what disability, that's why I come here, @@@ permanent @@@ right.

DOCTOR D030
Yep.

PATIENT D030
Yeah but that's why we'll get this right.

DOCTOR D030
What's this on the bottom here?  Down here.

PATIENT D030
Yeah.  Oh.

DOCTOR D030
Now DOCTOR isn't here any more.

PATIENT D030
Oh.

DOCTOR D030
Did she tell you?

PATIENT D030

DOCTOR D030
There's somebody who replaced her and her name is DOCTOR.  @@@ introduce herself.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

DOCTOR D030

PATIENT D030
@@@.

DOCTOR D030
I'll have her fill this one out.

PATIENT D030
Alrighty.

DOCTOR D030
@@@.  Otherwise it looks like you're in good shape.

PATIENT D030
Alright.  @@@.

DOCTOR D030
Just sit up here for me, I'm gonna take a look at you.  Anything else I can do for you @@@.

PATIENT D030
No I think that's about it.

DOCTOR D030
Okay.  

PATIENT D030
You know it took a long time cause I had a 10 o'clock appointment and @@@ could have done you know at least 30 minutes after my appointment now and I'm usually in and out.

DOCTOR D030
They told me they checked you in.  They had here you were at 10:30.

PATIENT D030
Oh.

DOCTOR D030
When I came to look for you um and I couldn't find your @@@ they had the paperwork and then it disappeared and so.

PATIENT D030
Yeah okay, I talked to two people out there and try to you know, like this guy with the heart thing and then talked to him.

DOCTOR D030
Oh okay.

PATIENT D030
So maybe.

DOCTOR D030
Yes.

PATIENT D030
Maybe they pulled my papers while I'm talking with them or something I don't know.

DOCTOR D030
I think that's the problem cause I know you showed up early.

PATIENT D030
Oh yeah I was here long before 10 o'clock.

DOCTOR D030
And you were yeah.

PATIENT D030
Always, I'm always early.

DOCTOR D030
And maybe they took it yeah.  So that's.  Few deep breaths for me.  One more.  You sound good.  

PATIENT D030
Okay.  Did I mention to you, I did mention to you about that low heart rate I get sometimes at home right?

DOCTOR D030
Yep.

PATIENT D030
But you said that's nothing to worry about huh?

DOCTOR D030
But if you feel, dizzy if that does happen. 

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D030
Then um I would say you could just hold off on your atenolol.

PATIENT D030
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D030
For a few days and see if it helps you.

PATIENT D030
I'll see.

DOCTOR D030
And you can always come back to Urgent Care.

PATIENT D030
Yeah, I'll keep track of that then.

DOCTOR D030
But yeah.  I'd say the best thing to do is take it, if you want to check it, take it first thing in the morning but you're on a small dose and your blood pressure is otherwise controlled so it's helping protect your heart a little bit but if you know, it you check it and it's low then you can stop it.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

DOCTOR D030
Uh I'll check it and if it's low. You can always many an appointment to see me sooner.

PATIENT D030
I always check it first thing in the morning.

DOCTOR D030
Okay.

PATIENT D030
Right before I eat.

DOCTOR D030
Okay.  Um yeah if you have no other problems I'll see you back in four months.

PATIENT D030
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR D030
Yeah but let me go have DOCTOR.

PATIENT D030
Oh oh, okay yeah.

DOCTOR D030
@@@ so she can have those @@@.  So I'll see you in August.

PATIENT D030
Oh okay good.

DOCTOR D030
Four months.

PATIENT D030
Good.

DOCTOR D030
About a week before you um, like a few days before the next appointment, come to the Lab and get your blood drawn and we'll check to make sure that vitamin D has been replaced.

PATIENT D030
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D030
I suspect it should.

PATIENT D030
Uh and when I come to the Lab for that, I'm probably not going to be in the computer or anything.   I just go in there and I don't have to be right?

DOCTOR D030
Yes I'm putting in the computer right now.

PATIENT D030
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D030
For um August.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

DOCTOR D030
So any time after August 1st you can come in and get that checked.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

DOCTOR D030
And I @@@ these other pills that will replace your low level.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

DOCTOR D030

PATIENT D030

SECOND DOCTOR D030

PATIENT D030

PATIENT D030

SECOND DOCTOR D030
Hanging in there.

PATIENT D030
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR D030
I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR D030
I've been working in the Blue Clinic.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR D030
So the Blue Team I'm working is DOCTOR gave me the scoop on your history.  Sounds like you're doing great.

PATIENT D030
Oh yeah I feel great too.

SECOND DOCTOR D030
Yeah youâ€™re not leaving us much to do.  

PATIENT D030
Good.

SECOND DOCTOR D030
Yeah but there's a couple things we can talk about but for the most part you're doing really well.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR D030
So I just wanted to make sure that you met me.

PATIENT D030
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR D030
So I'm always around but DOCTOR is taking good care of you.

PATIENT D030
Okay.  DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR D030
DOCTOR.

PATIENT D030
DOCTOR okay.

SECOND DOCTOR D030
Okay take care.

PATIENT D030
Okay, sure will.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
Thank you.  Okay, so um I'm going to write your cholesterol numbers down so you have them on this paper.

PATIENT D030
Okay, the what now?

FIRST DOCTOR D030
Your cholesterol numbers, would you like to have them?

PATIENT D030
Yeah, do that, yeah, yeah that's a good idea.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
Okay this is a list of all your medications that you're on right now anyway so we'll just give you and um so all of your numbers look good.  So your total, @@@ total cholesterol.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
Um HDL is the good cholesterol.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
And remember H is for healthy.

PATIENT D030
Yeah okay.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
And it looks like you're 149 and then your LDL remember L for lethal, is your bad cholesterol.

PATIENT D030
Hmm.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
Is 67 and so we want, so to meet your goal less than 200 you want this above 40, this one less than 150 and this is less than 70.

PATIENT D030
Above 40?

FIRST DOCTOR D030
So right, so there's no medication.  Well there is a medication that can raise it but the other thing that can raise it is doing aerobic exercise.

PATIENT D030
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
So either walking or riding a bike or something.

PATIENT D030
Kind like kills the walking.  Cause my wife gets up at 6 o'clock every morning and goes for a walk, oh maybe about a mile, mile and a half, with my neighbor.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
Okay.

PATIENT D030
And I'm going to go so bad but I drop out about half a block because this knee is so bad.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
Oh right.  Now can you do swimming or biking?

PATIENT D030
Uh a stationary bike.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
Yeah.  So if you just do it you know for about 20 or 30 minutes, enough to break a sweat.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
You don't have to be drenching.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
But you need to do that @@@ and that'll help raise it.

PATIENT D030
Oh okay.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
But this number is everything else looks good so I wouldn't say that this is low enough and these other numbers are not abnormal so I wouldn't.

PATIENT D030
Okay that should be up in the 70s?

FIRST DOCTOR D030
40s.

PATIENT D030
Oh show I should go, I was looking at that @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
That means greater.  Greater than and less than.

PATIENT D030
Okay.  Okay, @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
So it's not low enough because @@@ I wouldnâ€™t put you on another medication.

PATIENT D030
Uh-huh.  I'll see if I couldn't get it up by the next time I get here.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
Okay.

PATIENT D030
Alright.  Thank you very much.

FIRST DOCTOR D030
You're welcome, take care.

PATIENT D030
You have a nice day now.

FIRST DOCTOR D030

PATIENT D030

FIRST DOCTOR D030
Nope, you don't have to check.  I'll send that medication in the mail.

PATIENT D030
