DOCTOR O873
Well let's see, I'm going to look over at Jesse Brown and see what they're talking about.

PATIENT O873
Okay.

DOCTOR O873
So you just had a bunch of lab tests today.

PATIENT O873
Yeah, yeah, so see I missed my first operation that they scheduled me.  It was back during October or November because my church was doing a rehearsal to do our Christmas concert.

DOCTOR O873

PATIENT O873
Okay doctor.

Okay.

DOCTOR O873
Maybe a touch higher but.

PATIENT O873

DOCTOR O873
Okay.

PATIENT O873
And I keep getting flyers.

DOCTOR O873
Do you see a DOCTOR?

PATIENT O873
Yeah, yeah DOCTOR is the surgeon.  I just started seeing him and he's a surgeon so I know they getting ready to operate and I can't see out.

DOCTOR O873
Are you doing whatever eye drops they're telling you to use?

PATIENT O873
Yeah, yeah I'm using that but the thing is my pressure still be elevated and then I'm becoming far-sighted.

DOCTOR O873
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O873
You know, every time I do that, what is that called way front you know where they have you look and then get your eyes adjusted and it be clear.

DOCTOR O873
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O873
But it always be blurry and then when I read, I'm farsighted.  Farsighted, I really can't see out of this eye now.  I can't see past 50 feet.  And then now it's beginning to happen with my left eye and my left eye is my good eye so I'm wondering what's going on and then well now, last time I seen the private doctor for my uveitis he had gave me a prescription for bifocal glasses.

DOCTOR O873
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O873
And then after about two or three appointments here I went back to him and he said all of a sudden I got a lens problem, the bifocal glasses won't help me.  So he had to get me, so I had new reading glasses.

DOCTOR O873
Hmm.

PATIENT O873
I said what happened and he say I have a lens problem now and I said well when did that develop and he say glasses won't help me with my farsightedness.

DOCTOR O873
Hmm.

PATIENT O873

DOCTOR O873
Can you see him today or?

PATIENT O873
Well I scheduled to see him uh next month.  My appointment is. 

DOCTOR O873
April 15th.

PATIENT O873
Yeah April, uh-huh cause I called in and rescheduled and I was just so busy cause my wife @@@ when I needed my wife came in, I had to bring her in, uh because she did a biopsy the last time she was here and I had to bring her in last week and they had to go in and get some more of the tissue because they said it may be cancerous.

DOCTOR O873
What kind of a?

PATIENT O873
She has and so she had surgery on the fourth floor in the fourth floor, I brought her in the other day and that's when I came down here and made them find out when was my appointment was to see you.

DOCTOR O873
Okay.

PATIENT O873
Yeah.  Since I was wondering when my appointment was cause I know I needed to talk to you and my wife was having her surgery to see if they tissue, they had to go back into the side and take a lot of this tissue off to make sure they got it all so she was having cancer in a mole, uh-huh.  So she, then her car went out on her, she had a car went out on her.  The timing broke and then torqued the engine, I never heard of that.  They say Japanese made cars, if you don't change the timing belt in 60,000 miles it'll zap your car and you don't get, you out of the warranty.

DOCTOR O873
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O873
And I say well man, I said @@@ cars out there cause let them know when they bring in the car in when you get 60,000 miles, 
they said no that's their responsibility, they're supposed to read their manual.  I say oh man and she got to spend 4 grand on an engine man, just finished paying on the car.

DOCTOR O873
Geez.

PATIENT O873
I tell you man it's always something.

DOCTOR O873
There's always something.  Are you taking aspirin still?

PATIENT O873
No I had to discontinue that because when they did the surgery and when I developed a glaucoma.

DOCTOR O873
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O873
What it is the aspirin thins my blood and it ended up raising the pressure in my eye.

DOCTOR O873
Okay.

PATIENT O873
And they definitely told me I couldn't take it prior to that oral surgery.

DOCTOR O873
Yeah cause of surgery but otherwise did they tell you you shouldn't take it at all?

PATIENT O873
Yeah, yeah and I been having chest pain.

DOCTOR O873
Did you get that treadmill test done?

PATIENT O873

DOCTOR O873
Oh you.

PATIENT O873
Yeah.

DOCTOR O873
Did you do it here as well?

PATIENT O873
I did it here and I did it at Jesse Brown and I talked to the heart doctor up there.

DOCTOR O873
What did they say?

PATIENT O873
They wanted me to do the test again but Jesse Brown ended up doing it prior to my cause I had to have the operation and instead of putting me on the treadmill, they induced the heart rate.

DOCTOR O873
Right.

PATIENT O873
You know how they give you an injection.

DOCTOR O873
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O873
And some man there and my heart is racing and they got me hooked up to the EKG machine and then when I got through my eyes was bloodshot red man.

DOCTOR O873
You're sure you even had this stress test in the last few months here?

PATIENT O873
Oh yeah it was a little farther back, a little farther back.

DOCTOR O873
But you saw this DOCTOR.

PATIENT O873
Yeah.

DOCTOR O873
In October and he ordered one.  Did you get that one?

PATIENT O873
He ordered one here but I ended up having it done at Jesse Brown.

DOCTOR O873
Okay.  Okay, so you didn't have it done here.

PATIENT O873
Yeah.

DOCTOR O873
You had it at Jesse Brown.

PATIENT O873
Yeah.  Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O873
So I'll see if we can find that at Jesse Brown.

PATIENT O873
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O873
You said it was fine or?

PATIENT O873
Uh yeah, yeah because they say it was okay to have surgery.

DOCTOR O873
Okay.

PATIENT O873
You know.  The only thing I was concerned about is that my eyes turned red and then after I come out of surgery in Recovery the doctors knew my pressure was high, my blood pressure was high and my eyes were red again so I don't know if something has something to do with the @@@ pressure is up or something going on with my eyes again.  You know they noticed that they were bloodshot during that test.

DOCTOR O873
I never heard about not taking aspirin.  I mean I know for surgery.

PATIENT O873
Yeah.

DOCTOR O873
But not in general.

PATIENT O873
Oh they definitely said not to take it prior to surgery.

DOCTOR O873

PATIENT O873

PATIENT O873
Yeah, yeah cause I have a heart murmur.

DOCTOR O873

PATIENT O873
I have a heart murmur and prior to exercising, walking on the treadmill, I get the chest pains and then all of a sudden once I get into my exercise it goes away yeah.

And uh, they told me well your testosterone was low and that's what started it but you know, I don't know, if you want.  I know my wife was taking hormones and then her doctors made her take them when she started coming to the VA, made her stop taking them because they were messing with the women,  they were telling the women they were causing cancer.
