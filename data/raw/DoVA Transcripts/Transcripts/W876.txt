DOCTOR W876
How are you?

PATIENT W876
Good.  I was falling asleep over there.

DOCTOR W876
@@@.

PATIENT W876
What's that?

DOCTOR W876
@@@.  Uh once a year I'll find something @@@ send you here um pulmonary function tests and the reports were normal.

PATIENT W876
Yeah Excellent.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah exactly.  Uh how you doing overall?

PATIENT W876
Um I still have that cough.

DOCTOR W876
Still have that cough huh.

PATIENT W876
Yeah.  It um hasn't got any better um.  As a matter of fact it's gotten um I think its a little worse um.  I believe, I'm getting heart palpitations and I think it might be from that uh because I think it's something I get not only at the time I cough or right before I cough.  I haven't figured it out before or after I cough it seems like I've been getting little heart palpitations.

DOCTOR W876
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W876
And I know @@@ probably so.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah and you had a stress test recently.  You had a TSH that was normal.  Uh.

PATIENT W876
What do all these numbers mean?

DOCTOR W876
Cause your stress test is pretty much to see if you're having – what would be causing the palpitations or its just decreased blood flow to your heart, serious heart problems.

PATIENT W876
We did that last year I think it was, wasn't it?

DOCTOR W876
Yeah, yeah.  You got that last year.

PATIENT W876
Yeah we did it last year.  I remember that.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.  Um we ended up getting a TSH cause we concerned about the thyroid hormone and that your thyroid hormone was elevated @@@ through that that was normal.  Uh we checked your cholesterol once again this also goes along the lines if you don’t have blood flow to your heart, cholesterol is high then it could be what causes palpitations but that was normal.

PATIENT W876
Okay.

DOCTOR W876
So um the reason I ordered the pulmonary function tests, one of the most common causes of a chronic cough is asthma and you don't have asthma.  Uh so there are other common cause of chronic cough actually, there are two other causes.  One is reflux.  Reflux can actually cause a cough, it can cause a cough @@@ asthma @@@.  So um do you have reflux after you eat?

PATIENT W876
You know I didn't know what's going on here um I think um a while back they gave me some pills cause they was thinking it was acid reflux.  That was before the uh any of the tests that you just described uh the cardio test or that pulmonary test, that was before that.  They gave me some medication um which actually caused one of the side effects and I read those things, unlike most patients.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
I read them.

DOCTOR W876
Sure @@@.

PATIENT W876
One of the side effects was coughing.  So you ask me will it really do any good, I took these pills so I think maybe 30 days.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
Three or four weeks.

DOCTOR W876
Do you know what pill it was?

PATIENT W876
Should be in my records, I don't remember the name of it.  But um that was supposed, I guess @@@ the cause but they was discussing acid reflux and uh cause I was like, “acid reflux?” 
Cuz’ isn’t that something you can feel like in your throat like you're about to throw up or something.

DOCTOR W876
Uh @@@.

PATIENT W876
They said no this could be going on in my stomach and I wouldn't feel it.  But one of the side effects was coughing so how are you going to get someone on medication for coughing when one of the side effects is coughing?

DOCTOR W876
Well I mean.

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
Right, like you said, profiles oftentimes, unless they are like black-box warnings, oftentimes, for example I can say nausea and vomiting, you'll see nausea and vomiting or GI upset for almost every single medication, but it doesn't mean that everyone has it.  Uh they can actually improve your @@@ so there’s multiple random-controlled trials of uh and well-documented uh trials showing that these medicine can help with the cough.

PATIENT W876
Well when you come back and you say well  did it do any good.

DOCTOR W876
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W876
So my answer to that is I don't know.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.  Well @@@.

PATIENT W876
If one of the side effects is coughing.

DOCTOR W876
If it didn't suppress your coughing, then it didn’t do good.

PATIENT W876
Yeah.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
If it cause coughing – I didn’t know if it suppressed it.

DOCTOR W876
No, no right.

PATIENT W876
And then I had a side effect?

DOCTOR W876
No it's very simple.

PATIENT W876
Oh.

DOCTOR W876
Did the medication help, did your coughing stop after you started taking the medication?

PATIENT W876
No.

DOCTOR W876
Okay so it didn't help.  

PATIENT W876
Um and I guess I've been noticing I mean when I get up in the morning I'm okay and usually after I eat you know later on in the day is when the cough starts, starting back.  So I'm thinking am I having an allergic reaction to something um.

DOCTOR W876
I'm sorry what?

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
Repeat what you just said I'm sorry.

PATIENT W876
I said in the morning time it seems to be okay.  Then later on in the day is when it starts, after I eat something.  So I start to notice that.  I don't eat a lot of acidic foods.  That's one thing about me I do not eat acidic foods so I'm thinking am I allergic to something cause I try to keep my PH balance in my day.  I take pills for that.

DOCTOR W876
What are you taking?

PATIENT W876
Uh well I take a thing that's @@@, that's alka balance.  But you know I don't take them every day.  No I just kind of watch my pH I have a pH strips that I use @@@. 

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
To see what my pH, because I want to keep it slightly Alkaline @@@. Well, that’s going to help anyway because it helps acidic @@@

DOCTOR W876
Well I mean actually you know, those medications can result in uh.  You're talking about altering the pH of your stomach um which.

PATIENT W876
Yeah.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah you can do that but uh often times we recommend against that and the reason why is because the bacteria, the reason why your @@@ low pH for one reason @@@ protective mechanism uh but that uh @@@ kills the bacteria yeah.

PATIENT W876
I think that was supposed to @@@.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah so uh it keeps the pH at a very low level to slow bacteria up here so if you're @@@ high reflux you know you can aspirate some of the reflux um it won't be filled with bacteria, you know what I'm saying.  Um so I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing that.  Uh what we can of do though, I mean uh how long have you been on it?  Are you still taking the omeprazole?  Are you still taking that?

PATIENT W876
I think it was a 30 day supply.

DOCTOR W876
30.

PATIENT W876
Yeah two weeks or 30, something like that.  Two to four weeks.

DOCTOR W876
Three refills @@@ on.  And you say you took it only for 30 days or did you take it for less than that?

PATIENT W876
I just took whatever was in the bottle.

DOCTOR W876
What was in the bottle.

PATIENT W876
I didn't refill it.

DOCTOR W876
And it didn't help you at all?

PATIENT W876
Uh uh.

DOCTOR W876
Okay alright.  Uh usually three month trials.

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah let me see what DOCTOR thinks about that.  The other thing that it possibly could be is uh people end up having postnasal drip and uh postnasal drips occurs.  What it sounds like to me, it sounded like reflux coughing because you're saying that it occurs after you eat um and that you notice when you wake up in the morning and it occurred after you eat um.  You know the postnasal drip cough is a little bit different because the postnasal drip cough occurs at night when you lay back down, you get it then.  So now, omeprazole like with a reflux cough can happen at night @@@ too.  That's a very common reason for @@@ when you lay down you cough @@@.  But I mean it sounds like it occurs after you eat, that's what you were saying.  So it very well could just be that I mean you need a higher dose of the omeprazole.

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
Okay, alright. 

PATIENT W876
That one didn't work.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
So I don't, I mean if I double up on something that doesn't work.

DOCTOR W876
Well I mean it could just be the fact that you need a higher dose you know.

PATIENT W876
Yeah.  My body is supposed to take care of itself.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
And that's what I don't want to take pills to take care of this stuff so why. I don't suspect the cough.

DOCTOR W876
Well @@@.

PATIENT W876
I want to find out what's causing it.

DOCTOR W876
Well sometimes it's very difficult to find out what's causing it.

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
And I wouldn't expect and @@@ is suppressing the cough, you're not suppressing the cause what you're doing is you're ending up treating the cause and that is the way you go about finding out how, what the cause is.  If you end up taking the omeprazole and it actually works then that is the cause.  You understand?

PATIENT W876
@@@.  I think if I have a problem and I take something that suppresses the cough or makes me feel comfortable with it, what stops, then I'm taking the pill and I @@@.

DOCTOR W876
Uh well if you want to problem to go away.

PATIENT W876
What's causing me, what's causing acid reflux?

DOCTOR W876
Very common.

PATIENT W876
Is it the food that I'm eating or I wouldn't think so because I'm not eating acidic foods so I'm starting to watch what foods I eat.

DOCTOR W876
Do you drink coffee in the morning?

PATIENT W876
No I do not.  I do not drink coffee no.

DOCTOR W876
Well first of all right now we don't even know whether it's reflux or not so I mean, so I mean I think it sounds like reflux to me but if you're not willing to take the omeprazole then we'll see what else, I mean that's not something that we need to do.  The other thing is @@@ it seems like the serious causes are out of it.

PATIENT W876
See my thing is that the problem keeps coming and the pills take care of it and dilutes the acid in my stomach that means yeah the pill dilutes the acid in my stomach then I stop coughing.

DOCTOR W876
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W876
But the problem still exists.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah well sometimes you can't, you can't.

PATIENT W876
I want to know what the problem is.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
So if you're gonna be taking something and we don't know what the problem is.  We don't even know if it's acid reflux.  I take the pills, like they asked me to.  I took their pills.

DOCTOR W876
Right.

PATIENT W876
It didn't help.

DOCTOR W876
Right.

PATIENT W876
I took them as prescribed, they didn't help.

DOCTOR W876
Sure yeah.

PATIENT W876
Uh it didn't help at all.

DOCTOR W876
Okay.

PATIENT W876
So to me @@@.

DOCTOR W876
So it didn't help at all then that's surprising.  Uh like I said I would admit that doesn't fit, in the picture. It didn't help at all, that surprises me.

PATIENT W876
It got worse.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah, yeah and then the other thing that we can possibly do is we could once again is trial, but what we'd do is we'd give you a trial of medication and we'll see if it works.  If it works then that's the cause.  That's the way that it works.

PATIENT W876
If it works, it helps resolve.

DOCTOR W876
Exactly.

PATIENT W876
The issue but it doesn't cause.

DOCTOR W876
It doesn't cure the problem.

PATIENT W876
It doesn't cure the problem right.

DOCTOR W876
Well unfortunately we don't have a lot that we can cure problems with.

PATIENT W876
Yeah.

DOCTOR W876
@@@.

PATIENT W876
I want to find out why.

DOCTOR W876
Okay.

PATIENT W876
Why I’m haVing @@@.

DOCTOR W876
Okay.

PATIENT W876
I mean because my diet and I changed my diet.

DOCTOR W876
How's everything else going for you other than the cough?

PATIENT W876
Heart palpitations I don't know if it's being caused by the cough.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah we can give you some.

PATIENT W876
That’s kind of scaring me.

DOCTOR W876
Well I totally understand.  When you get, we can give you something called a Holter monitor.  Have you ever had one of those?

PATIENT W876
@@@ thing that monitors the beat of the heart.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.  So it monitors the beat of the heart but it monitors it for 24 hours and when you're telling me is you have heart palpitations almost every day, when you cough right?  Whenever you cough?

PATIENT W876
Yeah I think it just recently started in the last week or two.

DOCTOR W876
Week or two, I have it documented for like the last time you were here that you had heart palpitations.

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah and that was back in, let's see it was back in uh let's see.

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
Back in November.

PATIENT W876
Yeah, November?

DOCTOR W876
Yeah and.

PATIENT W876
Last month?

DOCTOR W876
Last month.

PATIENT W876
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR W876
And then.

PATIENT W876
Okay.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah and I have it again back in August of 2009 and then I have it back in.

PATIENT W876
Oh okay.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah so I mean.

PATIENT W876
So it's been doing this.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah actually you had it back in 2008 that you'd been having heart palpitations.

PATIENT W876
Yeah it's getting worse then.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah um okay.

PATIENT W876
But now I get it almost daily, It wasn’t daily back then.

DOCTOR W876
Well we can go ahead and give you a Holter monitor.

PATIENT W876
Okay.

DOCTOR W876
And uh see how you do.

PATIENT W876
Does it @@@ something?  

DOCTOR W876
No it just monitors your heart.

PATIENT W876
For the acid reflux.

DOCTOR W876
Um I don't think so, not that I know of.

PATIENT W876
@@@ what are the causes?

DOCTOR W876
Um anxiety.

PATIENT W876
Hmm.

DOCTOR W876
That could cause it.

PATIENT W876
I could definitely have that.

DOCTOR W876
I mean.

PATIENT W876
Stress.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.  Definitely.

PATIENT W876
Fatigue.

DOCTOR W876
That could cause it.

PATIENT W876
Cause I been trying to get more rest.

DOCTOR W876
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W876
I definitely try to get more rest since that started happening @@@.  So I been trying to get more rest.  The last couple of nights I haven’t been having @@@ seems like I get like four hours, five hours waking up @@@.

DOCTOR W876
Pretty stressed out?

PATIENT W876
Well stuff on my mind.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
You know @@@ I'm aware of that.  @@@ before.  So that's why I need to bring it down and try to eliminate all the things that causes stress so maybe that.

DOCTOR W876
You know.

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah that's good.

PATIENT W876
It helps.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah I know it does.

PATIENT W876
Yeah I need to get more of that.  @@@ love.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah um.  When do the palpitations occurs other than the coughing.  Do they ever occur without the coughing?

PATIENT W876
I'm thinking it's more the cough and I'm just trying to remember you know um.

DOCTOR W876
I mean if you.

PATIENT W876
I don't need to have any more.

DOCTOR W876
If you cough a lot.  If you end up coughing a lot and your heart, your hearts’ just going faster in response to it.

PATIENT W876
So that's what’s happening.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.  It very well could be that.  But you know we have to make sure that it's not necessarily a serious kind of palpitations.  Like I mean first of all it could be severe serious causes and non-serious causes causing the palpitations okay.  Uh serious causes result in your heart stopping beating so um and non-serious causes are I mean I'm sure that @@@ but at least you have the comfort of having a non-serious causes @@@ you know your heart beats irregularly for a couple of beats and then it comes back to normal.  So we can get, if you get the Holter monitor we can watch it for 24 hours and I mean you can just be walking around you know doing your everyday things and it will be analyzed and uh we'll go from there.

PATIENT W876
Okay.

DOCTOR W876
Okay.

PATIENT W876
With that I'm just going to get the heartbeat, I don't know if it monitors the breathing as well.

DOCTOR W876
No, it'll monitor, but the palpitations, the cause of it is the heart so.  I mean it could be the heart, it could be just your anxiety but we'll at least be able to find out whether it’s the heart or not.

PATIENT W876
With that, okay.  That's a little more cardiac stuff I guess.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah that always helps.  Exercise is excellent.

PATIENT W876
I want to do more cardiac stuff.  Cause I know exercises can do more cardio stuff.

DOCTOR W876
Where you lift?

PATIENT W876
Yeah I need to do more cardiac.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah I was going to say I lift but I don't @@@ run as much as I should.

PATIENT W876
Yeah I did real good when I @@@.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah that is pretty cool.

PATIENT W876
Then I think I'm fat.  @@@ more fat old age.

DOCTOR W876
@@@.

PATIENT W876
@@@ just to see if I cough.

DOCTOR W876
Sure.

PATIENT W876
And then if I cough I want to see if it's after I eat.

DOCTOR W876
Sure, yeah.  Monitor that.

PATIENT W876
See if that occurs.

DOCTOR W876
Try that, yeah that's a real good idea.  Uh.

PATIENT W876
Well I'm @@@ the body @@@ machine.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
So I'm just gonna have to watch my body.

DOCTOR W876
Alright let's @@@.

PATIENT W876
I'll take it cause this coughing @@@.  You know we had this back in, you know I had the palpitations but not the cough.  I had to come into the Emergency Room with that.

DOCTOR W876
Really.  For what?

PATIENT W876
I had palpitations um nauseousness.  Think it was last year, in 08 I think that was.  They put me on monitoring.  They monitored me for a few hours.  They took an EKG on me and everything.  

DOCTOR W876
Yeah so what we see, an EKG is just a snap shot, it's like what's occurring as body @@@ it's like a picture right.  Now this, the Holter monitor is a video recording.  So it watching, I mean you just go through your activities every day you know and so it kind of sees your every day life and it sees how your heart reacts to it so.  You know like I mean if you're not having palpitations at that minute and they did the EKG then it doesn't mean anything right?

PATIENT W876
Right, right.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
This is the smart way.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah.

PATIENT W876
So whenever it happens it's going to record it.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah and it usually happens during the day.  Sometimes the Holter monitor during those 24 hours might not have any palpitations at all so you know it @@@ much use.  But if you're having palpitations, you actually have heart palpitations then you know let's, just they can still take a look at it and we'll see what happens.  So when you actually get the Holter monitor, remember whether you had palpitations that day okay.  Okay check your other labs real quick.

PATIENT W876
Did you see whether I had any more refills for all the pills you gave me?

DOCTOR W876
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT W876
I need a refill for um; I think it was a cream from Dermatology.

DOCTOR W876
Oh, now what was it?  Is it the hydrocortisone, what was it?

PATIENT W876
I think it was um.

DOCTOR W876
When was the last time you saw Dermatology?  Do you remember?

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
Here we go.

PATIENT W876
Uh.

DOCTOR W876
You're on Retin A cream.

PATIENT W876
Retin A right.

DOCTOR W876
Yeah no problem.

PATIENT W876
That'd be good.

DOCTOR W876
@@@.  Is there anything else you need?

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
@@@.

PATIENT W876
Yeah that kind of concern me more @@@ cough is when the palpitations kick in @@@, four or five times a day you know @@@.

DOCTOR W876
How long do they last when it comes on?

PATIENT W876
It's like an interruption you know I guess.

DOCTOR W876
And do you get any chest pain or just palpitations?  Any shortness of breath?  I mean you can take a deep breath right, @@@ occasionally?

PATIENT W876
Well no, I @@@ no more of that.  I need to do more cardiac okay.  Maybe lifting more I mean, I mostly doing push-ups and I can push them up you know.

DOCTOR W876
Oh okay, yeah.

PATIENT W876
@@@.

DOCTOR W876
How many push-ups do you do?

PATIENT W876
Well I used to run.  I maybe do about; I mean I do about 60.

DOCTOR W876
Okay so about an hour.

PATIENT W876
And then I stop.

DOCTOR W876
Okay.

PATIENT W876
And then the only thing I maybe do 25, so probably like 100 pull-ups, you know five minutes.

DOCTOR W876
I think you're heart's in good shape though.  Alright I'll be right back.

PATIENT W876
Alright thanks doctor.

Okay.

PATIENT W876
Then I start, uh a little bit later on I start to cough.

SECOND DOCTOR W876

PATIENT W876
But I don't know if it's because I eat.

SECOND DOCTOR W876
And when they were @@@ treating you um you know DOCTOR a diagnosis and giving you the acid reflux pill, um, we could do relation with the eating you could you know get a formal upper GI where they have you swallow the barium and see if there is @@@ acid reflux they do the same thing.  Um and it's causing you to have more severe  reflux cause @@@.  Uh so we could check if there’s are relation after you’re eating and then you’re coughing. So if we could to an upper GI @@@ make an appointment @@@.
