PATIENT Y768

DOCTOR Y768

PATIENT Y768

DOCTOR Y768
Okay.

PATIENT Y768
And I take that you know the prostate thing at night.

DOCTOR Y768
Okay.  And that should be about it.

PATIENT Y768
Yeah should be about it.  I came in here back in February.  I came to the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR Y768
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y768
And they did some blood work on me for, for I think checking for kidneys or something because of the prostate pill that I was taking.

DOCTOR Y768
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y768
How does that look?

DOCTOR Y768
In January?

PATIENT Y768
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR Y768
Your liver function tests were normal.  Yeah it looks like all they checked was your liver function.

PATIENT Y768
I think so.  Yeah and I wanted to see about my blood count.  I haven't had nothing did on that in a while.

DOCTOR Y768
Yeah we should check some labs today, check some urine today.

PATIENT Y768
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Y768
Um and then the thing with the chronic cough like that.

PATIENT Y768
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Y768
Um have you had a chest x-ray recently?

PATIENT Y768
No, except when I had the surgery back in last August.

DOCTOR Y768
Okay.

PATIENT Y768
I think it was last August I had one.

DOCTOR Y768
Um have you ever been exposed to TB, tuberculosis that you know of?  Worked in a hospital or been in jail?

PATIENT Y768
Yeah, now a guy that I knew, sometime an old fellow I knew he had it.

DOCTOR Y768
Okay.

PATIENT Y768
But I came in.

DOCTOR Y768
You didn't live with him or anything like that?

PATIENT Y768
No, no.

DOCTOR Y768
Alright, alright.

PATIENT Y768
But I came here right after I'd heard and had a TB test about a year ago.

DOCTOR Y768
Yeah I know it doesn't sound like TB.

PATIENT Y768
Hmm.

DOCTOR Y768
So with a chronic cough the three most common things are could be a little bit of heartburn or reflux can irritate your vocal cords and sometimes you don't even notice it.  You don't even get the heartburn but enough acid gets up there to irritate it.  Um another thing can be the postnasal drip like the back of your sinuses can drip down into the back of your throat.

PATIENT Y768
Hmm.

DOCTOR Y768
Irritate the vocal cords.  So it sounds like maybe a little bit of each of those could be contributing but also what might be most likely it's this medicine lisinopril.

PATIENT Y768
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Y768
That's it's most common side effect is a cough and it sounds like the cough started around the same time you started that medication so I think it would be worthwhile to stop the lisinopril, see how you do um.  Your pressure today is pretty good.  Your pressure, you know we may not even need that lisinopril on there cause for the most part.  Like I don't think we need to replace lisinopril with another blood pressure medicine.  I think at this time we could just stop that and continue the water pill.

PATIENT Y768
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Y768
And if your pressure gets too high then we'll add a blood pressure medicine next time.  Can you take your shirt off and I'll get a good listen to your lungs.  And you haven't noticed like any chronic fever or weight loss or anything like that have you?

PATIENT Y768
No.

DOCTOR Y768
Could you take your other shirt off for me please?  Big deep breath.  Take a breath. Listen to your  heart.  Open your mouth, say ah.

PATIENT Y768
Ah.

DOCTOR Y768
Stick your tongue out a little bit.

PATIENT Y768
Ah.

DOCTOR Y768
Real wide ah.  Okay relax and then open wide ah.

PATIENT Y768
Ah.

DOCTOR Y768
Again.  No pain here right?  Yeah I think we'll try first stopping that uh, stopping that medicine, the lisinopril.

PATIENT Y768
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Y768
And that should take care of your cough.  If that doesn't work I think the next step would be maybe restarting that pill for your stomach because you could be having heartburn that is just enough to get up.  For instance since it's worse in the morning when you lay flat, the stomach contents can kind of travel up your esophagus and then irritate the vocal cords.  It might not be enough for you to feel it, feel the burning but it may be enough to cause that cough.

PATIENT Y768
Okay.

DOCTOR Y768
Well start first with that lisinopril.

PATIENT Y768
Okay.  And also I need my refills.

DOCTOR Y768
Uh-huh.  I'll refill them.

PATIENT Y768
Yeah cause the nurse was checking and she said something about some of them needed to be renewed.

DOCTOR Y768
Sure.  I'll be right back.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT Y768
Hmm.

(DOCTOR OUT:  15:35  DOCTOR IN:  18:56)

DOCTOR Y768
Alright so um, had a little bit different strategy.  It could be, it could definitely be the lisinopril but because it sounds like it's a little worse in the morning, that kind of leans more toward it being that reflux irritating it.  So I was going to talk it over with DOCTOR and we thought first we would try the omeprazole, that pill for your stomach, try it twice in the day and one in the night.  Um the best way to take that is on an empty stomach and then don't eat for about 30-60 minutes because that gives it time to absorb and it decreases the acid production.  Uh take that morning and night.  We're also gonna get a chest x-ray since it's been going on for a year.  Um and then we'll see you back here in about a month um, about four weeks, see if it's better.  If it's better then good, if not then we'll try stopping the lisinopril and switching that to a different medication.

PATIENT Y768
Okay.

DOCTOR Y768
Because of your diabetes you should be on a medicine either in the class of medicines like lisinopril is in or another class which is very similar, helps protect your kidneys, especially in diabetic patients.  So um sound like a plan?

PATIENT Y768
Okay.

DOCTOR Y768
Okay.  Uh and then have you get some blood work today too.

PATIENT Y768
Okay.

DOCTOR Y768
So you can head to the Pharmacy, Radiology and less than a month they'll schedule you your follow-up with me in four weeks.

PATIENT Y768
Okay.

DOCTOR Y768
Alright.

PATIENT Y768
Alright.

DOCTOR Y768
And then oh head to the Lab too, cause that's gonna check your diabetes measures and uh some other blood work as well too.

PATIENT Y768
Okay.  So I go to the Lab.

DOCTOR Y768
Lab, Pharmacy and Radiology.

PATIENT Y768
Oh that on the third floor, this floor?

DOCTOR Y768
Um actually Outpatient is on this floor, it's all on this floor.

PATIENT Y768
The Radiology?

DOCTOR Y768
Yeah.

PATIENT Y768
Where's that?

DOCTOR Y768
It's right next to the Lab.

PATIENT Y768
Oh.

DOCTOR Y768
You now what I mean, you're looking at the Lab its right there.

PATIENT Y768
Oh okay.  Alright.

DOCTOR Y768
Alright. 

PATIENT Y768

DOCTOR Y768
