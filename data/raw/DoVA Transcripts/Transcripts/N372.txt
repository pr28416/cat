PATIENT N372
I called for uh; renew that one prescription, pravastatin.  

DOCTOR N372

PATIENT N372
And they said I got to talk to a doctor.  Now I looked on my printout, not on there no more anyway.

DOCTOR N372
Hmm.

PATIENT N372
I don't take that no more?

DOCTOR N372
Uh I don't think I got, I didn't get any note saying that you needed more.  I'll check on that.

PATIENT N372
I just got a printout today.

DOCTOR N372
Right, yeah.

PATIENT N372
And it's not on there.

DOCTOR N372
Have you been taking every day though? Or are you out?

PATIENT N372
Yes. Yes, I'm out.

DOCTOR N372
When was the last time you took it?

PATIENT N372
Oh, I take it at night and it'd be tonight, otherwise it'd be last night or this morning.

DOCTOR N372
Okay.

PATIENT N372
Uh it's at nighttime so.  I took it last night.  Why isn't it on my list?

DOCTOR N372
Um it's expired so.

PATIENT N372
Oh I get it.

DOCTOR N372
Let's see.  Would you like it sent to you by mail?

PATIENT N372
Yeah.

DOCTOR N372
And then you're levothyroxine or your Synthroid that looks like it's been expired as well.

PATIENT N372
What is it?

DOCTOR N372
Your Synthroid, thyroid hormones.

PATIENT N372
Oh.  No I think that was there, wasn't it?

DOCTOR N372
Yeah it's called levothyroxine.  Synthroid is the trade name.

PATIENT N372
Oh.

DOCTOR N372
Same thing.  So we need to renew that for you.  

PATIENT N372
Looks like I still got some left on that one, I don't know, whatever.

DOCTOR N372
Okay.

PATIENT N372
DOCTOR wants me to keep taking that.

SECOND PERSON N372
For what reason?  The thyroid?

PATIENT N372
Yeah.

DOCTOR N372
Now let's go through medications.  Okay, so overall you've been okay though since the last time I saw you a few months ago?

PATIENT N372
Now what?

DOCTOR N372
You've been doing okay since I saw you last?

PATIENT N372
Yeah.  That's how I play.

DOCTOR N372
Okay um.

SECOND PERSON N372
It's amazing how you young people can do that.

DOCTOR N372
You know, but it takes a lot of practice you have to learn it in school and train your mind.

SECOND PERSON N372
Yeah, I mean they're training little kids in preschool and that's you know.

DOCTOR N372
Yeah when I was growing up we learned it when we were in middle school.

SECOND PERSON N372
Yeah.

DOCTOR N372
And we didn't, there were no computers @@@.

SECOND PERSON N372
Oh my God, just when I see your fingers move and I see my little grandkids come over and start just typing away like crazy on the computer.

DOCTOR N372
Yeah, yeah.  Um okay so you're still taking your Coreg 12.5 twice a day for your heart?

PATIENT N372
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR N372
You don't have them memorized, your medications?

PATIENT N372
Yeah that's like a half a tablet yeah.

DOCTOR N372
And then the water pill you only take when your foot swells right?

PATIENT N372
I been taking it every day.

SECOND PERSON N372
No.

DOCTOR N372
Did you have it.

SECOND PERSON N372
Every day, I don't know why cause he keeps going to the bathroom all the time.  Is it necessary for him to take it every day?

DOCTOR N372
It's um it's not necessary but it helps control your blood pressure and takes like the fluid off.

SECOND PERSON N372
Oh.

DOCTOR N372
It's not a bad thing if you're doing both and your blood pressure today was great.

SECOND PERSON N372
Yeah.

DOCTOR N372
Um, let's see and then um you're on the pravastatin 40 mg which has been reordered now.  Um and you saw Cardiology.  I had you go see them @@@.

PATIENT N372
They added and he.

DOCTOR N372
They started the lisinopril.

PATIENT N372
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N372
Um then they stopped the Plavix.

PATIENT N372
Right.

DOCTOR N372
Alright.

SECOND PERSON N372
Is that a good thing?

DOCTOR N372
Yeah I mean the Plavix you don't need forever.  It's only for you know a time for a bypass or heart attack or something.  Um and then they also, you still follow with the Coumadin Clinic right?  Your INR today was 2.66 which is good.  Um and then I saw you walk in with a cane, you looked like you were doing fine.  How's that going, any falls or?

PATIENT N372
I didn't fall.

DOCTOR N372
No falls.  That's always good.  No falls.

PATIENT N372
Next spring.

DOCTOR N372
Um alright and then we're continuing your Synthroid and you did say that DOCTOR already talked to you about that.  Um and in terms of a health maintenance there's really not a whole lot, right now, you know given your age you kind of already had all the shots that you needed and you don't need any more colonoscopies, your last one's normal.  Um and then we talked the last time about following your abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Uh you didn't really have one; it was 2.9 centimeters which may be a little bit more than normal but not quite an aneurysm.  Uh that was seen on CT last summer and then we talked and you didn't really want to follow it every year.  Um so it looks like you're doing pretty well um.

PATIENT N372
Does it say what my blood test today and Coumadin does it way what it was?  Yeah it was 2. uh actually no, yeah 2.66 today.

DOCTOR N372
Oh that's good.  Yep.  And I didn't really need you to do any labs this time, but maybe next time. If you wouldn't mind actually now that you're up here, just having a seat on the table.  And I'll just take a quick listen to your heart and lungs.  

PATIENT N372
Can you pull that out?

DOCTOR N372
Oh sure, there you go.

DOCTOR N372
Let me see if I can get it to work, no I don't think it's going to work, sorry.  Sometimes it.

PATIENT N372
Alright.

DOCTOR N372
Do I need to help you?

PATIENT N372
No.

DOCTOR N372
Okay.  Alright.  Take a quick listen to your neck and then your heart and lungs.  Take deep breaths in and out.  Can you open your mouth for me?  Tongue, okay.  I'm just checking your pulse.  I want to take a look at your legs.  Okay you have just a tiny bit of swelling.  Do you feel like this gets worse when you've been on your feet?

PATIENT N372
Oh I don't even pay attention, I don't know.

DOCTOR N372
It's just barely anything but the water pill is good for that so you're okay if you don't have it every day.

PATIENT N372
That's what I take them for.

DOCTOR N372
Yeah.  Okay.  Alright I'm going to run over and talk with my attending really quick and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT N372
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N372
We have to do that unfortunately.

(DOCTOR OUT:  54:11  DOCTOR IN:  56:56)

DOCTOR N372
Alright.  You're actually good to go um.  I put in all of your refills to be mailed to you.

PATIENT N372
Okay.

DOCTOR N372
And then if you need any labs I'll take care of that before and they'll just have the nurse call you but I don't really need to see you back for six months.

PATIENT N372
Good.

DOCTOR N372
You're doing pretty good um.  You know the main thing last time was having you see Cardiology and managing your medications and your blood pressure is controlled, that looks perfect.

SECOND PERSON N372
He's going for eye surgery in June.

DOCTOR N372
Okay.

PATIENT N372
Cataracts.

DOCTOR N372
Oh I see okay good.  Um but besides you know the things we already talked about there's really nothing left for me to do.

SECOND PERSON N372
Okay.

DOCTOR N372
So you're doing good.

PATIENT N372
The only reason I use that wheelchair is cause it's a long walk to the parking lot.

DOCTOR N372
I know, that's why they're available.  But I watched you walk, you're walking very well.

PATIENT N372
Yeah.

DOCTOR N372
With the cane so that's good.

SECOND PERSON N372
Thank you.

DOCTOR N372
You're very welcome.  Let me walk you over to this.  Alright sir.

PATIENT N372
Okay.

DOCTOR N372
Nice seeing you again, take care.

PATIENT N372
Take care.

DOCTOR N372
Take care.

SECOND PERSON N372
