Okay, here’s what we’re going to do.  We're going to get the cough medicine called guaifenesin.  That'll help you cough up the stuff.  The other thing is, do you have a humidifier at home?

PATIENT E128
No.

FIRST DOCTOR E128
Sometimes a humidifier can help with that.  Um it can, if you get the air a little bit wetter, because the air feels dry and everything.

PATIENT E128
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR E128
Then it makes the mucous dry and then it's harder to cough up and if you have a humidifier or if not um you know you can boil some water on the stove and breathe in the steam that might help too.  But I'm gonna give you this medicine to help break it up.  You want it mailed to you or do you want to pick it up?
