Yeah.

PATIENT V298
I only sleep about four hours.

DOCTOR V298
Are you using your oxygen at night?

PATIENT V298
Every time I do it doesn't help me @@@ but then they told me to put uh the distilled water, you know what I mean but we've been out of it.  Uh that didn't help either for my mouth and my nose is very dry.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
They can’t find out what it is.  It's been about seven, eight, ten years ago.  There was a little lump in here.  They took it out @@@ it was not cancer or anything like that.

DOCTOR V298
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V298
But what is it, blood clot or something, why does it stop me from breathing.  Why can't they find that out?  Is it on my lungs; is there something wrong with my lungs or what?

DOCTOR V298
Hmm.  Um.

PATIENT V298
And uh, and another thing and another thing the last time I was here, I went over to the urologist.  @@@ for a CAT scan and never got nothing out of it.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
And uh I'd like to take uh @@@ what is it, sometimes I feel like a little pain in here you know, it's coming down from the heart, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR V298
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT V298
So I don't know uh so @@@ and find out what it is @@@.

DOCTOR V298
Like do an EKG, the EKG you mean?

PATIENT V298
Yeah.

DOCTOR V298
Oh.

PATIENT V298
Yeah. I want to find out @@@ the blood is circulating okay.  Is the heart working out okay.  I don’t even know.  I told them to find out or get some kind of a test you know when they took the biopsy of the kidney, see if that kidney function or something.  But this time I'm falling apart.  I usually be able to walk and I'm doing exercise.  Now I can't do it, I just can't breathe now.  I'm coughing like crazy.

DOCTOR V298
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V298
So what's causing that, what it is then.

DOCTOR V298
Well okay, so let's focus on one thing at a time.

PATIENT V298
Okay.

DOCTOR V298
Let's talk about the breathing.

PATIENT V298
Okay.

DOCTOR V298

DOCTOR V298
So did the dry mouth get better after stopping it?

PATIENT V298

DOCTOR V298
Tiotropium?

PATIENT V298

For the past five, six months, they've tried six different guys - the urologist @@@ you know and uh he was going to take a CAT scan to find out and see what's happening with my inside, you know, not only the kidney and @@@ but they never or they're supposed to call me.

DOCTOR V298

DOCTOR V298
But a different medicine for your bladder.

PATIENT V298
No, they're not giving me any other medicine, what is it?

DOCTOR V298
They said that you were taking it and then stopped it because you had some side effects.

PATIENT V298
Maybe that's the one.

PATIENT V298
When @@@ of the kidney.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298

Okay so then just wait until the CT scan.  

PATIENT V298
Okay.

DOCTOR V298
I remember you telling me about this.

PATIENT V298
Yeah.

DOCTOR V298
But I don’t think it's really that big of a deal.

PATIENT V298
Alright.

PATIENT V298

DOCTOR V298
Okay uh, I’ll put it in. Let's see Pulmonology.

PATIENT V298
When the doctors talked to me, @@@ I actually want to find out why I can't, why my breathing is so bad.

DOCTOR V298
Well I saw his note, what they wrote in the computer.

PATIENT V298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V298
Um let's see if they can see you on the same day so you can do it on the same day as the CAT scan.  @@@ yeah @@@.  Uh so they evaluated you for the breathing okay.

PATIENT V298
Yes.

DOCTOR V298
Um.

PATIENT V298
Well one time @@@ try to find out @@@.

DOCTOR V298
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT V298
And then to say.

DOCTOR V298
It was not complete.

PATIENT V298
It was not complete and they had trouble with @@@.

DOCTOR V298
So they said that um.

PATIENT V298
Because I didn't do nothing.  All I knew is @@@.

DOCTOR V298
Yeah well they said that they could repeat it.  And sometimes that happens with studies, they're just not, you know it doesn't happen properly for whatever reason.

PATIENT V298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V298
So but uh you were reluctant to repeat the studies so they said that they think that you were having maybe some decrease of oxygen at bedtime.

PATIENT V298
Yes I do.

DOCTOR V298
And that's why they wanted you to just keep the oxygen on at nighttime and they said that might help with your sleeping.  Has that happened or?

PATIENT V298
No it, I didn’t sleep from 9 o'clock, 9 o'clock in the evening till the morning 7 or 8 o'clock, I do have the oxygen.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
And I do it.

DOCTOR V298
But you're still not sleeping well?

PATIENT V298
No.

DOCTOR V298
You're not sleeping well.

PATIENT V298
No.  I @@@ four hours.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
One day I had one hour of sleep.

DOCTOR V298
Why are you waking up is it because you have to urinate or?

PATIENT V298
No I used to, but not anymore.

DOCTOR V298
Okay um.

PATIENT V298
It's not that I @@@.

DOCTOR V298
Are there problems with like falling asleep or @@@?

PATIENT V298
Well normally I wake up and then like after three or four hours I wake up.

DOCTOR V298
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V298
And you know all of a sudden that's it, I'm awake.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT V298
I try to stay in bed you know so I can sleep some more.

DOCTOR V298
So do you wake up, uh does anyone sleep around or, do they say you snore?

PATIENT V298
No, no, @@@.

DOCTOR V298
@@@.

PATIENT V298
No I don't snore, not that I know.

DOCTOR V298
No one's every told you you snore.

PATIENT V298
Yeah, yeah, I don't snore.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.  The best thing do is the sleeping test, I don't know what else to tell you.

PATIENT V298
Okay @@@ cause this is a lung problem.

DOCTOR V298
Yeah.

PATIENT V298
Can they take uh x-ray of my lungs and see what it is?

DOCTOR V298
Well you can't tell from an x-ray.  They did do an x-ray.  They did an x-ray back about a year ago we did an x-ray and it was normal.  The only thing that you have is the emphysema which we already know.

PATIENT V298
Emphysema is what, it's in the lungs right?

DOCTOR V298
It's like a disease from smoking that you get in your lungs.

PATIENT V298
And @@@ right.

DOCTOR V298
It means that your lungs are kind of stretched out.  It just happens from smoking.  Cause that's why you take all these inhalers, that's for emphysema.

PATIENT V298
Oh, that's not clear in other words, what will it get better or stay?

DOCTOR V298
It doesn't go away once you have it.

PATIENT V298
Doesn't go away.

DOCTOR V298
What we do is just treat it.

PATIENT V298
Treat it.

DOCTOR V298
With just using the inhalers that's it.  But that shouldn’t cause you from having problems with sleeping.

PATIENT V298
I understand but it's different.

DOCTOR V298
So that's a different problem.

PATIENT V298
Well.

DOCTOR V298
So what we need to do.

PATIENT V298
The other thing I have is I feel sleepy now.

DOCTOR V298
Yeah.

PATIENT V298
So it's for a lack of oxygen I have.

DOCTOR V298
Yes.

PATIENT V298
And that's what causes.

DOCTOR V298
Yes.  

PATIENT V298
Okay.

DOCTOR V298
But you know you're using the oxygen and you're not, it's not any better right?

PATIENT V298
Now you also told me.

DOCTOR V298
But are you using the oxygen @@@.

PATIENT V298
Yes I do.

DOCTOR V298
@@@.

PATIENT V298
No.

DOCTOR V298
So then the only other thing is to do the sleep study again and watch, they monitor your oxygen, they monitor your breathing, everything.

PATIENT V298
And you think I should go back.

DOCTOR V298
Yeah, it’s a completely safe study there’s nothing @@@

PATIENT V298
No I understand that.

DOCTOR V298
You know, but it's important @@@.

PATIENT V298
Okay, okay.  If you want me to I'll do it.

DOCTOR V298
Well if you, you know you can't sleep so you need to know why and the best way is to come up and do a sleep study so.

PATIENT V298
Oh.

DOCTOR V298
You know it's not like a harmful study you know.  It's just that you @@@.

PATIENT V298
But I think, I don't know if it was overnight.

DOCTOR V298
Overnight yeah.

PATIENT V298
Yeah overnight.

DOCTOR V298
Yeah.

PATIENT V298
Okay.

DOCTOR V298
So.

PATIENT V298
That's what I did the last time on it.

DOCTOR V298
Yeah.

PATIENT V298
They could not get good results.

DOCTOR V298
There was something wrong with it and so they'll have to do it over.  That happens also unfortunately sometimes the studies, you don't get the information they want.

PATIENT V298
Now what about, how can they check my heart see if it's about blood circulating.

DOCTOR V298
Why don't you think you don’t have @@@.

PATIENT V298
Cause I do get a pain once in a while.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
And I got to reach in and grab a Bayer aspirin.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
Because I’m afraid that I’m gonna have a heart attack.

DOCTOR V298
Okay when does this pain come?

PATIENT V298
Uh when , what time?

DOCTOR V298
Like what are you doing?  Are you just sitting there or?

PATIENT V298
Oh once.

DOCTOR V298
Walking or?

PATIENT V298
No not when I'm walking.  It's when I'm sitting sometimes then you know when I watch TV.

DOCTOR V298
Uh-huh yeah.

PATIENT V298
Or uh.

DOCTOR V298
So just sitting.

PATIENT V298
Yeah.

DOCTOR V298
Do you feel short of breath when you get this pain?

PATIENT V298
Oh yes, yeah.

DOCTOR V298
But you get the pain then you feel like you can't breathe?

PATIENT V298
Right.  @@@ can't breathe @@@.

DOCTOR V298
Short of breath. Do you feel sweaty and your jaw hurts?

PATIENT V298
No.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
@@@.

DOCTOR V298
If you want to do an EKG we can do an EKG and we'll know in a second, look at it you know and see.

PATIENT V298
Well.

DOCTOR V298
If there's anything abnormal.

PATIENT V298
If it is will it show on it or can they do it here or @@@ do I set it up?

DOCTOR V298
Oh your angiogram.

PATIENT V298
Angiogram.

DOCTOR V298
Well they aren't get an angiogram just for once in a while chest pain.

PATIENT V298
I understand that.

DOCTOR V298
@@@.

PATIENT V298
When do they do an angiogram to find out?

DOCTOR V298
If they do an angiogram, we check your heart if you having chest pain or if you do a stress test and it comes back abnormal they might do an angiogram.  If you're having really bad chest pain and it's very likely you're having a heart attack.  But if it's just once in a while when you're sitting watching TV that's not necessarily that worrisome.

PATIENT V298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V298
Um but if you have chest pain very often or say you're walking and you have chest pain and you rest and it goes away, that’s a scarier type of chest pain.

PATIENT V298
So that's.

DOCTOR V298
Then we're going to do an angiogram for that so.

PATIENT V298
What do you recommend?  Is there one that @@@ clean out the arteries what is it just one artery?

DOCTOR V298
No.

PATIENT V298
How ca I figure out what artery it is.

DOCTOR V298
You have to do a stress test and look inside or you can look inside.  They aren't going to just do an angiogram unless there's some really concerning findings.

PATIENT V298
Okay.

DOCTOR V298
Um and like I said you have to have really bad chest pain or you have to have an abnormal stress test.

PATIENT V298
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V298
If you really want a stress test, you can get a stress test and we can see if you know @@@ something is going on with your heart.

PATIENT V298
I don't know if the stress test @@@.

DOCTOR V298
If you feel tired you know when you're walking and things like that.

PATIENT V298
Yeah, right, right.

DOCTOR V298
Anything like that.

PATIENT V298
If I'm walking yeah.

DOCTOR V298
Okay so an EKG and we can get a stress test if you want.  Have you ever had a stress test before?

PATIENT V298
Uh stress test, not here.  I had a stress test.

DOCTOR V298
Long time ago?

PATIENT V298
Yeah.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
A couple of times.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
Like before, when I had, with my other doctor and I @@@.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
@@@ Blue Cross Blue Shield.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
And I had it at St. Luke's over here @@@ hospital you know.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.  Can you walk on the treadmill?  Probably not, do you get too tired?

PATIENT V298
I don't, I get tired when I'm walking you know from the parking lot.

DOCTOR V298
Yeah.

PATIENT V298
To the, like maybe 100 feet or something.

DOCTOR V298
Okay.

PATIENT V298
Now a treadmill, I might, I don't know how many steps or whatever you know but the people over there.  The last time there were four or five different specialists over there.  You know what I mean they're waiting for the, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR V298
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V298
If anything happens then they bring you back to normal or uh.

DOCTOR V298
Okay so I just ordered a stress test for you.  

PATIENT V298
But before we do anything else, they'll probably do, @@@ run out of it right?
