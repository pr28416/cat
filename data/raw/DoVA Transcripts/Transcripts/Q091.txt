DOCTOR Q091
PATIENT?  You're here. 

PATIENT Q091
Here.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh, there you are, sorry about that.  I wasn't looking at this chair.  How you guys doing?

PATIENT Q091
Alright.

DOCTOR Q091
Come on back.  Come on in, alright.  Good to see you again.  It's been a few months.

PATIENT Q091
Yes it has.  I don't like this system.  I used to make appointments, now they you get on at six months.

DOCTOR Q091
I know.

PATIENT Q091
Anyway, I was just looking this list over.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

PATIENT Q091
And this one is missing, the vitamin D.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
And I'm out of them.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  Oh.

PATIENT Q091
I have the one I take for the 15th but that emptied it and I called them in and they tell me they're gonna get to you and get permission and call them back in a week but.

DOCTOR Q091
Well you know why because we only do that high dose monthly vitamin D for three months but then it's supposed to go to weekly.  Let me just see what we need.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Really.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah, if somebody is very deficient in vitamin D, we put them on a high dose pill once a month for a few months, no you know what we do, we do it once a week for a few weeks and then we'll go to once a month.

PATIENT Q091
I was once a month always.

DOCTOR Q091
You never were on once a week.

SECOND PERSON Q091
No.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh, let's just see what we had.  Did I prescribe this for you or did you get it from one of the other doctors, do you remember?

SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh I wonder if DOCTOR.

PATIENT Q091
No uh uh, it was a doctor here.  I don't know.

DOCTOR Q091
Not the kidney?

PATIENT Q091
I've had so many.

DOCTOR Q091
Kidney folks?

PATIENT Q091
Could have been DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh yeah could have been DOCTOR.

PATIENT Q091
Probably DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON Q091
@@@.

PATIENT Q091
Or what's that gal's name that was the pharmacist?

SECOND PERSON Q091
I don't know.

DOCTOR Q091
You know it looks like your levels are actually and you just had them done and they look normal.  Let me just.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh good.

DOCTOR Q091
It looks like they've come back up.  So we may be able to put you on a lower daily dose rather than worry about this high dose stuff.  Let me see here.  Yeah I think we could probably move to a daily.  How long have you been taking that monthly vitamin D?  Has it been a long time?

PATIENT Q091
Oh I would say at least a year.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  Just that one tablet a month?

PATIENT Q091
Yes.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Yes.

DOCTOR Q091
Well I mean if it's working.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Alright, okay.  It was added uh in December of 2010 and it was DOCTOR.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh so it was uh, okay so we'll just keep going with it then.  I don't want to change the uh you know.  You want to just here; do you want it in the mail?

PATIENT Q091
Yes.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
I still, I just took the one, the 15th I took one and so I got a month to get it.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Q091
There's no overdose problems?

DOCTOR Q091
No it's rare to overdose on vitamin D yeah um okay, so that's in, okay.

PATIENT Q091
And there's a lot of these that you better check cause they're down to one refill.

DOCTOR Q091
Yep we'll go through all of them.

PATIENT Q091
I really have fun trying to get them when they run out.

DOCTOR Q091
Let's go through all those.

PATIENT Q091
That pharmacy joke.

DOCTOR Q091
But first just to check in are you still taking your blood pressures at home?

PATIENT Q091
Yeah I got a new blood pressure machine here because I think and it starts here.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
And goes on the back page because the other one was way off.

DOCTOR Q091
So this was your new one you just got like a week ago or so.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.  I'm running at 130 you're talking about.

DOCTOR Q091
You're a little high.

PATIENT Q091
Every once in a while I'll get down but uh.

DOCTOR Q091
Overall a little high.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
Now I was just looking at the last time you saw DOCTOR.

PATIENT Q091
Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
And DOCTOR you see him too it looks like.

PATIENT Q091
That was just Friday.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah and they had suggested that you, so you're taking the Valsartan 160 mg in the morning and then.

PATIENT Q091
No.

DOCTOR Q091
What are you taking for Valsartan?

PATIENT Q091
I take Valsartan 160 after dinner.  I take 160, two of the pills.  Then at bedtime I take either one or two, depending on what the blood pressure is at that time.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  So you take two in the morning?

PATIENT Q091
I don't take them in the morning.

DOCTOR Q091
How come you're not taking them in the morning?

PATIENT Q091
Cause I'm taking them when they told me to, for years.

DOCTOR Q091
They told you to take those at night?  We have written in the note that it's in the morning, that's the only reason I asked.

PATIENT Q091
Well I think that'd be a lot smarter because it doesn't work very fast.  For instance.

DOCTOR Q091
Right.

PATIENT Q091
If I take it at dinnertime, the blood pressure, you'll notice on there the blood pressure goes up at night.

DOCTOR Q091
Right.

PATIENT Q091
Every night and after I've taken two of these, so they must be very slow acting.

DOCTOR Q091
That's, so that's the reason I asked because what they suggested was that instead of taking that extra Valsartan if it's high you change it and make it a different medication that's faster acting that you can take if you have a high reading, called hydralazine.  It's another blood pressure pill.  It works very quickly so it'll bring you down faster.  Like you said the Valsartan doesn't work quickly.

PATIENT Q091
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q091
So I think what we should do.

PATIENT Q091
Why don't they put on the bottle when to take it?

DOCTOR Q091
I don't know and it should be.

PATIENT Q091
None of them do.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh they don't put that on them?

PATIENT Q091
Not a single bottle tells us when to take them.

DOCTOR Q091
Well I can @@@.

PATIENT Q091
This is what I take when.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  So after breakfast, okay let me check it with my list here.  Alright so amlodipine you're taking the one in the morning and then your furosemide you take in the morning, metoprolol you take a half twice a day good.

PATIENT Q091
Yep.

DOCTOR Q091
And then allopurinol you're only taking every other day?

PATIENT Q091
Yes.

DOCTOR Q091
I don't even have that on here, oh yes I do.  Do you get that from us?

PATIENT Q091
Yes.  Oh wait a minute, maybe I.

DOCTOR Q091
No maybe you get that one.

PATIENT Q091
Maybe that's the one I get at Target cause it's four dollars.

DOCTOR Q091
Yes that's probably what it is and then after lunch you have a gabapentin okay and then another one in the evening okay.  Then you have the Valsartan at okay and your aspirin and then another Valsartan.  And you have the simvastatin at night.

PATIENT Q091
And then that one, on the other side it's the, that was the vitamin we were just talking about.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh the vitamin D and then you have you're um your pain pills, the Vicodin as needed okay.

PATIENT Q091
Okay now what I have, I have a three year old bottle of, I wrote it down, I'm having runny nose and itchy eyes, you know spring has come early.

DOCTOR Q091
Uh-huh.  Sure has.

PATIENT Q091
And this is what I used to have.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
Uh and also on the bottle I've gotten written for itch.  I haven't seen it, is that for, is this another one?

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah that's you know for allergies.

PATIENT Q091
My kids have cats so I really have a problem so what I need and they're three years old so I was afraid to take them.

DOCTOR Q091
We can get you some new ones, not a problem.

PATIENT Q091
But I'm wondering if that's what I should be taking now.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah that should be fine and then you can get this stuff over-the-counter but if it's easier we can get it for you. It's called, you'll see it over-the-counter as Zyrtec um and it's for itchy eyes, runny nose, these types of things um.

PATIENT Q091
Well put.

DOCTOR Q091
You could take one a day which is probably what you were taking previously.  Do you want a prescription for this?

PATIENT Q091
Yes please.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay let's put that in then.  Let me get that sorted out.  Do you want to pick it up today or do you want it sent out?

PATIENT Q091
No that's why I'm all dressed up; I'm going down to the big city for symphony for my birthday.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh my goodness.  Oh wonderful.  Oh yeah, so it was just your birthday a couple days ago huh.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Yes it was.

PATIENT Q091
Like yesterday.

DOCTOR Q091
How exciting.

PATIENT Q091
But I've had three of them so I.

DOCTOR Q091
So you're going to the Chicago Symphony is that the?

SECOND PERSON Q091
Yeah, three nights of it.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh how fun.

SECOND PERSON Q091
For a celebration.

DOCTOR Q091
My parents used to have season tickets and they were in the um seats that are like around the back of the orchestra so you're looking down.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh I wanted that.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Q091
We've never sat there.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh it was fun.

SECOND PERSON Q091
We'll have to do that sometime.

DOCTOR Q091
Sometime you guys should try the tickets there cause it's really interesting to be right in front of the conductor and you get to look down on the percussionists and it's a completely different view and the sound is, in that place is great everywhere.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Yeah.  We sat on the last row in the gallery.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh yeah.
SECOND PERSON Q091
It's wonderful.

DOCTOR Q091
Its awe, I mean it's such an amazing place.

SECOND PERSON Q091
It is.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay, so that one's in and then I have on here that you have an albuterol inhaler.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
Do you still have that one?

PATIENT Q091
Yes.

DOCTOR Q091
Do you take it as needed?

PATIENT Q091
Yes and I only seem to get wheezy at night.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
Usually every night I'll have to take a couple of puffs of that.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  I think what we'll.

PATIENT Q091
Is that not on there?

DOCTOR Q091
Uh it's not on; it's not on your list.

PATIENT Q091
No well I don't show it there.

DOCTOR Q091
It's on mine though and you still have it.

PATIENT Q091
Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
I think what we should do is have you take the valsartan um 160 mg in the morning, that after dinner dose, I think you should move it to your after breakfast dose.  Are you okay with doing that?  Because that's what they have written in your kidney doctor notes that you're taking it in the morning and I don't know why that got confused um but usually it's better to spread out those doses so that it will work for you.

PATIENT Q091
You say take two, cause I get 80 mg.

DOCTOR Q091
So take the two of them after breakfast.

PATIENT Q091
Okay and then when do I take the next one or two?

DOCTOR Q091
You know what I think probably what we should do is maybe bump you up to having you just take two in the evening.

PATIENT Q091
So two in the morning and two in the evening?

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah that's kind of.

PATIENT Q091
When you say evening are you talking bedtime or you're talking dinnertime?

DOCTOR Q091
You know what, it doesn't really matter that much um.

PATIENT Q091
Well.

DOCTOR Q091
You know usually with a medicine like this that you take twice a day, we space them about 12 hours apart because that's the amount of time they usually work so if you get up and you eat breakfast at 8 o'clock and you take your medicines at 9, then take it probably before bed at 9, but if you're a real early riser and you're taking them at about 6.

SECOND PERSON Q091
He's not an early riser any more.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay, okay.  So take them after breakfast and then maybe before bed.

PATIENT Q091
Would you write that down please?

SECOND PERSON Q091
I am.

PATIENT Q091
Is there any way they can put that on the tab?

DOCTOR Q091
I'm gonna change it so that you do.

PATIENT Q091
Because not a single medicine there.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah I.

PATIENT Q091
And uh.

DOCTOR Q091
And I know, they'll probably.  I'm trying to think, you're running a little bit high um.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah I'm running.

DOCTOR Q091
But we don't want you to be too low either.  DOCTOR wrote in her note that um they want you to be more a goal of the 140/90s for you because we don't want you to drop too low.

PATIENT Q091
I never get 90 the second one.

DOCTOR Q091
Well under, under 140/90.  But your top number's usually higher than 140.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
So.

PATIENT Q091
140.

DOCTOR Q091
You do have a couple in the 100, 110 reading.

PATIENT Q091
@@@ well I even got a 103 here.  103, 46.

DOCTOR Q091
We don't want you know, those low ones to go any lower.

PATIENT Q091
142 but then it's 122, 19, 10, then 160, 146, 165, 150.

DOCTOR Q091
So you're not, you're not really far off goal.  You're not so high that I want to make a lot of changes so maybe instead what.

PATIENT Q091
Maybe it won't be high if I take them at the right time.

DOCTOR Q091
Well that's what I'm thinking.  You might be under better control if you're going to take your valsartan in the morning now and you're seeing DOCTOR again next month.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah because the creatinine got high.

DOCTOR Q091
Creatinine went up a little bit.

PATIENT Q091
She wants another blood test in six weeks.

DOCTOR Q091
So yeah okay.  So maybe that's the only change I want to make today is to really change the time.

PATIENT Q091
Right.

DOCTOR Q091
Of that dose and see if that helps um, cause I'd hate to add another medication and have you go any lower.  We don't want to see you get too low because then you can start seeing things like dizziness or.

SECOND PERSON Q091
He went through a period of that.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Now if he takes two pills it’s been so erratic @@@.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Q091
It's hard to change.

DOCTOR Q091
Right.

SECOND PERSON Q091
The medications.

DOCTOR Q091
I'd almost rather you be just a little above goal then to worry about falling.

SECOND PERSON Q091
He really feels lousy when it's low.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh I'm, it's a terrible feeling I mean, so 150s-160s but with some lower values in the 100s-120s.  We'll give you valsartan after dinner 160 mg and also before bed either 80 or 160 mg okay.  How are you feeling overall?  Are you feeling okay?

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  So you're not having low blood pressure where you're actually getting real dizzy or lightheaded?

PATIENT Q091
No I haven't had that.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
And I haven't had any swelling either.

DOCTOR Q091
That's great.  That's good.  And then the Vicodin is controlling the pain okay?  You have the arthritis pain is that right?

PATIENT Q091
Well it's funny how that, it does the back and hips really good.  I mean plus the fact that my family doctor I see every six months.

DOCTOR Q091
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q091
Gave me some exercises in the morning.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh that's good.

PATIENT Q091
Back exercises.  And that, so I really, I was always taking six Vicodin and most of the time now I take four.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
But if I can't sleep because I'm in so much pain but the Vicodin doesn't work for the shoulders.  It seems to work from here down.

DOCTOR Q091
That's a little strange.

PATIENT Q091
And that's strange isn't it.

DOCTOR Q091
Hmm.  Have you tried ever anything else?  I mean that's a pretty good pain medicine but.

PATIENT Q091
No.

DOCTOR Q091
Maybe the shoulder, we're seeing a little more inflammation.

PATIENT Q091
Well I just.

DOCTOR Q091
I don't want you to take any.

PATIENT Q091
When I had my six month with the family doctor.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

PATIENT Q091
And he gave me a cortisone shot.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh okay.

PATIENT Q091
He wouldn't do the other one because he wants to see if it works and it worked.

DOCTOR Q091
Good.

PATIENT Q091
So I may go back and have another one, but I had the right shoulder replaced.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh you did okay.

PATIENT Q091
That was eight years ago and it's the worst but and I was trying to get an appointment with that guy and I don't know, they don't answer their phones.

DOCTOR Q091
You saw an orthopedic doctor?

PATIENT Q091
Oh yeah, the one that.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Was it here?

PATIENT Q091
The one that, no it was at the Hinsdale Hospital.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay. 

PATIENT Q091
Hinsdale Orthopedics, for both my back and both knees have been replaced too.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  Are you doing okay with the orthopedic doctors there or did you want to see someone here?

PATIENT Q091
No.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay, okay.

PATIENT Q091
I got enough doctors.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  Alright so we did the medicines um and then you have your allopurinol you get at Target.  The aspirin, baby aspirin you take, we looked at that one and then your eye drops, it looks like and you get that from someone else.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah after this doctor here I wouldn't take them.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh really.  @@@.

PATIENT Q091
Which made my eye doctor mad cause he was involved somehow with the hospital here and so I went to her and she said you got to quit him and bring all your files to me.  It was a woman downstairs here.

DOCTOR Q091
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q091
And I said all I wanted to do was get the medication and she said nope won't do it.

DOCTOR Q091
Hmm.

PATIENT Q091
Eye drops so I was paying, well I just went generic it went from $97 a month to 12 or something.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh well that's good.

PATIENT Q091
Crazy.

DOCTOR Q091
That's a lot better isn't it?

SECOND PERSON Q091
Wow.

PATIENT Q091
So it's uh and one of them is about $40 and one of them is $20.  I went to Canada to get one of them.

DOCTOR Q091
Hmm and they tried to get them and they wouldn't give them to you here?

PATIENT Q091
Nope.

DOCTOR Q091
Hmm.

PATIENT Q091
Now any other time, like my heart doctor's recommendation.

DOCTOR Q091
Hmm.

PATIENT Q091
And he would fax it here and they would you know whoever would, I've had five of you.

DOCTOR Q091
Right I know.

PATIENT Q091
But they automatically would put it in.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

PATIENT Q091
The heart doctor did that and I don't know that my family doctor.

DOCTOR Q091
Well if you fax me a prescription from your eye doctor I can try to get them here.  If I have prescription I can try to put it in.  @@@.

PATIENT Q091
Well it's down to you know $12.

DOCTOR Q091
Well that's a lot better yeah.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah it's not worth doing now I don't think but uh.

DOCTOR Q091
Maybe we can have.

PATIENT Q091
Well you give me three capsules of course I don't know what that would cost outside.  So many of that stuff is in the $4 list now.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

PATIENT Q091
At the drug store.

DOCTOR Q091
It makes it much easier.

PATIENT Q091
But I don't know and you.

DOCTOR Q091
I think ours are 8.

PATIENT Q091
Uh I think they're 9 now, they were $8 now they're 9.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh they're 9, they all went up.

PATIENT Q091
Which is alright but when you're only getting three pills I don't know.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.  Well we'll go through your lab tests real quick.  Your vitamin D, as I said, it looks okay.  A little low still so we'll keep you on the same thing that the kidney doctor wanted.  Um I'm sure they talked to you a little bit, your creatinine is elevated as you know.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah but I didn't get the point there was anything I could do about it.

DOCTOR Q091
No I think they're just observing like keeping away from any medications that could make it worse and I think controlling the blood pressure as well.

PATIENT Q091
That's what.

DOCTOR Q091
As you can is the best thing.  Blood counts look fine, no problems there.  No anemia anything like that.  Um urine looks good.  Electrolytes all look fine.  We talked about the creatinine.  Cholesterol looks good, no problems with that and the liver.

PATIENT Q091
I'm surprised that's as good cause they cut that down, I'm cutting out the pill I have in quarters.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh really?

PATIENT Q091
Yeah what does it show here? 

DOCTOR Q091
Simvastatin.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah well I probably have 80 originally.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh and now they're.

PATIENT Q091
I was taking a half of that.

DOCTOR Q091
You're at 20.  Are you getting your 40 mg pills now?  You are supposed to be getting 40.

PATIENT Q091
I haven't gotten any yet because I got them once but I had so many left over that I'm cutting up.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh.

PATIENT Q091
And I've been taking those.

DOCTOR Q091
Well that's, that's annoying but it's fine if you want to use those up.  I know it's annoying to cut them in fourths.  The next one you get should be a 40 mg pill so you'll only have to cut that one in half.

PATIENT Q091
And you cut that in half.

DOCTOR Q091
Right but the cholesterol levels look really good.  Your liver function looks completely normal and your iron is normal too.  Your iron level, so everything looks actually really pretty good.  Um except for the kidney function and we talked about that already.  So keep going on that and then make sure you have a refill.  Gabapentin you're taking basically two capsules a day.  Is it easier for you to get 90 day supplies of things?

PATIENT Q091
Yes.

DOCTOR Q091
Let's change that then.  Some of these are at 30 or 60; I don't know why they do that.

PATIENT Q091
I don't know either.

DOCTOR Q091
So the next time you should get 90 day supply, we'll give you three refills so you don't have to keep calling.  Metoprolol oh that one's a 30 day supply, see I don't know why they have it.  Let's give you a 90 day supply of that one too.  And then hopefully it'll last you a little longer.  It looks like pantoprazole has been renewed.  That's the one you take for the acid reflux.  

PATIENT Q091
Has it been renewed?

DOCTOR Q091
It's been renewed.

PATIENT Q091
Because that's the one that ran out.

DOCTOR Q091
Simvastatin.

PATIENT Q091
And how many?

DOCTOR Q091
That's a 90 day.

PATIENT Q091
But you're putting that in for.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

PATIENT Q091
Some more refills, because we figure what you're six months.

DOCTOR Q091
Yep.  Yep so you should have at least you know.

PATIENT Q091
Now the one you can't do for six months is the Vicodin.

DOCTOR Q091
Right I can only do a 30 day supply.  Amlodipine, let's give you a 90 day supply of that one cause you're on a 30 day supply okay.

PATIENT Q091
How many refills can you give me on Vicodin?

DOCTOR Q091
Um I don't think, I don't know that there's a limit.  I can give you as many refills as you want.

PATIENT Q091
Well somebody said they could only go for four refills or something.

DOCTOR Q091
You have two right now.

PATIENT Q091
That changes and I don't think it's a good as it used to be.  I don't know what they did to it.

DOCTOR Q091
They took a little bit of the Tylenol out of it is what they did.

PATIENT Q091
Did that affect it?

DOCTOR Q091
Well you know, the stronger drug in the medication, the hydrocodone was not changed and they decreased the Tylenol because they're finding that higher doses of Tylenol can cause liver problems along down the road so having less Tylenol in there is less harmful to your liver but it may have taken away some of the pain.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah it doesn't work as good.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay I've given you a bunch of refills of that one so you'll have enough.  Albuterol you have plenty of refills on your inhaler.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah I don't use that as often.

DOCTOR Q091
Pantoprazole was already done.  Lasix, the furosemide you have a lot of refills but it's only a 30 day supply so let me make it a 90 day supply and we’ll havet everything to be 90 okay and valsartan you only have a 30 day supply so let me can change that one.  So this will basically just mean that the next time you order it, it should be 90 days worth, which will make things easier, you don't have to call as often and then the calcitriol.

PATIENT Q091
It makes it easier until you change the medicine and then I've got 90 days of it.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh yeah.  Well that's true.  Hopefully we won't be making too many changes and then the calcitriol, wait were you still taking that one?

PATIENT Q091
What one?

DOCTOR Q091
The calcitriol?

SECOND PERSON Q091
Calcitriol?

DOCTOR Q091
I don't think.

PATIENT Q091
What is that?

DOCTOR Q091
It's another type of vitamin D actually.  You had two times weekly is what I have on here.

SECOND PERSON Q091
He might take that I don't know.

PATIENT Q091
Look on our list.

DOCTOR Q091
And then the big vitamin D we already and your metoprolol it's showing me has expired.

SECOND PERSON Q091
What's that?

PATIENT Q091
What did you call it?

DOCTOR Q091
Calcitriol, this guy.

PATIENT Q091
Well I'm taking it.

DOCTOR Q091
Twice a week you're on that one?

PATIENT Q091
Yep.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh my gosh and you're taking the once a month as well?

DOCTOR Q091
It's yeah.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Gee, that's a lot of vitamin D.

DOCTOR Q091
Sometimes when people are low, so I mean I don't think I was the one who prescribed that for you.  Oh.

PATIENT Q091
That's what I'm doing.

DOCTOR Q091
So was this, this is from your primary doctor okay.

PATIENT Q091
No he is my primary doctor.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh but you made this?

PATIENT Q091
I made this also because everybody asks me.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

PATIENT Q091
These are all the operations and.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh yeah, this is good, okay.

PATIENT Q091
Do you want a copy of it?

DOCTOR Q091
No that's okay cause we have most of this information in here but it's good to have that with you.

PATIENT Q091
But does that clarify this?

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

PATIENT Q091
Cause I take, what's there I take.

DOCTOR Q091
So let's get you some refills then if it's, you know it seems to be working.  And the metoprolol we've got, oh wait that one twice.

SECOND PERSON Q091
How many milligrams is that vitamin D?

DOCTOR Q091
0.25 micrograms.  It's a different kind of vitamin D.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Oh is it?  Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
Um it works differently.  I can't tell you all the mechanisms but, make sure I am telling you the right thing.  You know I think it's because of the kidney disease, if I'm not mistaken.  I did that one twice.  So let's sign all those and these should be all refilled now.  It's telling me, why are you beeping at me.  It's telling me you had side effects to furosemide before, is that true?

PATIENT Q091
No. 

DOCTOR Q091
You’ve been taking it for awhile.

PATIENT Q091
No, no I haven't had any side effects from furosemide.

DOCTOR Q091
@@@.

PATIENT Q091
There was another one that I did have side effects with.  I forget what it was.  I think that it was one that I was taking when I was, before I had that tumor removed, what's that kidney, I forget.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  Alright so I have that all straightened out.  Let's do an exam and make sure everything looks okay.  Have a seat up here.  What time is your concert today?

SECOND PERSON Q091
1:30.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
When is it?

SECOND PERSON Q091
1:30.

DOCTOR Q091
I'm gonna retake your blood pressure just to see if it's gone down.

PATIENT Q091
I think it's gone down since I walked a half a mile.  You know since they changed the parking.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah I know.

PATIENT Q091
It's really a hike.

DOCTOR Q091
And you took all your blood pressure pills this morning?

PATIENT Q091
Yep.

DOCTOR Q091
Good.  About 152/72.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah see that's unusual too cause usually when I take those pills I go over to the Health Club and I ride the bike for a half an hour.

DOCTOR Q091
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q091
And I walk the treadmill for ten minutes.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

PATIENT Q091
And when I get home, I take it, you know I walk in the pool sometimes and uh when I get home it'll be in the 120s.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh well that's terrific.  I'm just going to peek in your ear.

PATIENT Q091
So the exercise must be.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh that's helping a lot yeah that's great.

PATIENT Q091
Helping.

DOCTOR Q091
You've got some wax in there.

PATIENT Q091
But I notice uh.

DOCTOR Q091
I'm going to look for you can put them back in.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah put you back on the air.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah that's why I don't really want to give you more blood pressure medicine because you have periods of time where you're normal, 120.  We don't want you to be a lot lower than that I mean then we'll start seeing some dizziness.  Open wide for me, say ah.

PATIENT Q091
Ah.

DOCTOR Q091
Good, and lift the end of your tongue, good.  Take your glasses off just for sec I want to take a peek at your pupils here.  Okay, you can put them back on.  Let me take a quick feel of the neck here.  Oh maybe a little bit of a lymph node on this side.  So do you have a little bit of?

PATIENT Q091
One of them was removed.

DOCTOR Q091
This side maybe.  Maybe that's why it's a little different.  Do you have a removal on that side?

PATIENT Q091
I don't remember which side cause I was about 30 years old.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
And I'm now 87 so that was a long time ago.

DOCTOR Q091
Long time ago.  A couple deep breaths here.  Good.  Alright go ahead and lay back for me, look at the belly.  I'm going to untuck you for a second here.  Have your bowel movements been normal?

PATIENT Q091
Yes.

DOCTOR Q091
No blood or tarry stools, black stools?

PATIENT Q091
Nope.  A stomach ache every once in a while that nobody can figure out.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah I think we talked about that last time you were here.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.  My family doctor said I should have a test at the hospital but.

DOCTOR Q091
How often are you getting it now?

PATIENT Q091
Well I think, about two or three weeks apart.

DOCTOR Q091
And it's still sort of late in the day?

PATIENT Q091
But it wasn't as severe last time.

DOCTOR Q091
Sit up for me.

PATIENT Q091
Only lasted four hours instead of 12.  I've had them last from after breakfast I would get it on Sunday so I didn't have to go to church and it would last until 11 o'clock at night.

DOCTOR Q091
Wait one more test for you.  Lets check your strength here.  Toes up in the air, you've been getting them less frequently, push down and kick up.

PATIENT Q091
I don't know if they're less frequent.

DOCTOR Q091
Push back.

PATIENT Q091
There's not as severe.

DOCTOR Q091
A little shorter okay.  This thigh up in the air, good and this one, ooh, you okay, got the hip huh.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
I'm sorry about that.  Give me a good squeeze, okay pull me towards you, now push me away good.  Arms up like this, nice and strong.

PATIENT Q091
Careful of that.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah you got that the shoulder, huh?

PATIENT Q091
The right one.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh this one okay.  Pretty good strength though, good.  Go ahead and relax.  Can you shrug your shoulders up, okay.  Can you put your arms up to your sides?  A little stiff.

PATIENT Q091
That's as far as they go.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay go ahead and relax, good.  Puff out your cheeks, all the way out like you’re blowing a candle.  There you go.  Stick your tongue out and to the right, to the left.  Let me see your teeth, good.  Now squint your eyes closed real tight for me, good.  Open them up.  Feel the same on both sides of your face?

PATIENT Q091
Yes.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  Chin to your chest like this and head all look at the ceiling.  A little stiffness in the neck.

PATIENT Q091
A lot of stiffness.

DOCTOR Q091
A lot of stiffness in the neck.  Can you turn your head towards the door and resist me, turn your head, keep going good and that side good okay.  Need a quick listen to your neck and then we'll be done here.  Turn back towards the door there and hold your breath.  Okay let it out, turn towards me and hold your breath again.  Okay good.  Alright go ahead and sit back down.  Do you have any trouble with your stools when you're having one of these stomach episodes?

PATIENT Q091
No.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay and does anything tend to make it better or does it go away on its own?

PATIENT Q091
Well it doesn't hurt when I sit and it doesn't hurt when I lie down.

DOCTOR Q091
So it's when you're up and about.

PATIENT Q091
So I go back to bed.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh I see okay and then when you get up again do you just feel better?

PATIENT Q091
I don't get up until it does get better.

DOCTOR Q091
I see okay.

PATIENT Q091
But they used to last 11 hours, almost to the time.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah I remember you were having more problems with them.

PATIENT Q091
But now I had a slight one yesterday when I went to my family doctor and he set up and I'm sorry I didn't write that, you wrote it down but you wouldn't remember it, what test he's giving me but there's a lower abdomen.  He's wondering about a artery blockage or something.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT Q091
So I'm waiting for the hospital, the La Grange Hospital to call me to go over for a test.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
That he called for but I can't tell you what it is because the name is unbelievable.  It's not something simple thing like lower stomach check.

DOCTOR Q091
So they're working that up with your primary care, okay.  Just let me know, you know what happens or if you need us to do anything here.

PATIENT Q091
Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay, let's just make sure we're up-to-date on all our other health stuff um.  Have you had a colonoscopy in the past?

PATIENT Q091
Yeah I used to take company physicals every year.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON Q091
That was a long time ago.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

PATIENT Q091
I haven't had one in 20 some years.

DOCTOR Q091
We don't, there's a certain age at which we stop doing those.

PATIENT Q091
Well that's what my doctor said.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah so I don't think we need to worry about it.  I was just wondering if there'd been one done because of the stomach pain okay so.

PATIENT Q091
Depending on what he finds he may want to do more so.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay and then let's just double check where we have with the immunizations, flu shot, pneumonia, tetanus and everything is up-to-date.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
So good and did we ever, were you a smoker in the past?

PATIENT Q091
Yes.

DOCTOR Q091
Did we ever, has anybody ever looked at your um aorta, do an ultrasound of the aorta?  We usually do it for men who've had a history of smoking.  Again you're probably over the recommended age where we tend to do them but we usually start them at 65 um and just check and see if that big vessel in your belly has dilated at all.  Do you ever remember having that done?

PATIENT Q091
I've had so many tests.

DOCTOR Q091
I'm sure you have.

PATIENT Q091
I don't know that that was one of them.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  I think you're over the age we usually do them but I'll double check.

PATIENT Q091
You don't show it in your records?

DOCTOR Q091
I don't show it in ours no.

PATIENT Q091
Cause I did something here but I don't remember what it was.  It was one of those, it's a little round.

DOCTOR Q091
That would've been it.  Was the thing like they use when a woman's pregnant?

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
Yep, then that's probably what it was.

PATIENT Q091
I don't know if that was here or at La Grange Hospital.

DOCTOR Q091
Alright we reviewed that, I thinks that's all.

PATIENT Q091
But I did, I had that.

DOCTOR Q091
And you have all your lab tests done with us right?  Do you get any blood work done outside?

PATIENT Q091
No.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  So we'll keep doing that.  We'll do some checks in six months and make sure everything is looking fine so and you're getting some blood tests done with the kidney doctor but I think.

PATIENT Q091
Yes.

DOCTOR Q091
Let me just see when that is ordered for you.

PATIENT Q091
She said six weeks.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah, yep so I'll double check and you know if nothing's been done in six months we'll just kind of update everything but it sounds like they're actually following you pretty closely too with the blood tests.

SECOND PERSON Q091
They're very good at that.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah good.  Um and I think we talked about everything else um.  I just have to run everything by my attending before we let you go but is there anything else you wanted to bring up or any concerns you have?

PATIENT Q091
No.

SECOND PERSON Q091
No I think we've covered everything.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
You've done a good job.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
Covering it today.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay good.  Well let me just go run everything by her um.

PATIENT Q091
Who is she?

DOCTOR Q091
She DOCTOR is the attending that supervises the clinics or we have two of them DOCTOR um and we just run everything by them before we let you head out and I'll just double check the blood pressure thing.  I don't think I want to add anything just because sometimes you're just fine or even low and I don't want you to be much lower.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah I'm confused too because I think I been, I don't think the blood pressure machine has been correct.

DOCTOR Q091
Maybe now that you have your new one.

PATIENT Q091
Maybe it'll, I hope that one's correct although it was off yesterday when I took it.

DOCTOR Q091
And we'll start the, we'll start the valsartan try a morning dose and see if that makes you a little more stable throughout the day.

PATIENT Q091
And you've got uh 160 in the morning.

DOCTOR Q091
160 in the morning.

PATIENT Q091
And either 80 or 160 at night.

DOCTOR Q091
Right depending on what you see in your blood pressure.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  Well let me just go double check everything with my attending might have another suggestion so I'll just be back in a few minutes okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  61:57  DOCTOR IN:  81:29)

DOCTOR Q091
Okay, sorry that took a while.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
I know you guys are ready to go so, we just talked a little bit about your blood pressure um and I think what we're gonna do is like I told you we're gonna start taking the valsartan in the morning, that two pills in the morning and then um as needed depending on what your blood pressure is running that day, take one or two then 12 hours later in the meantime and then when you follow up with DOCTOR next month then you can show her what you're getting at home and they can decide if they want to add anything else or if we want to just keep you where you are okay.  And then the other question I have for you, which we talked about that last time and I forgot to ask you was, is that gabapentin helping at all?  Do you feel?  With the pain?

PATIENT Q091
You know I wouldn't know unless I quit taking it.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah I know we talked last time that maybe it wasn't, wasn't really doing much for you and we were gonna see how it went.  You were put on that for the arthritis or for do we really know?

PATIENT Q091
Well I was going to a pain doctor and at one time they were gonna install, they tried that device where they put the wires up on both sides of the spinal cord and then you have a remote control controlling vibrations and if it worked it was on the outside and if it worked they were gonna implant it.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

PATIENT Q091
And we got to that stage and then I had that angina attack and they had to put in a splint and then they decided they wouldn't do that at all.

DOCTOR Q091
Well did you feel like that was working?

PATIENT Q091
Uh, actually I quit using the outside stimulator because I didn't, it helped when I had the severe pain but the Vicodin started handling it and the exercise started taking care of that pain pretty good so I.

DOCTOR Q091
Do you want to try to get off the gabapentin?  I mean if you're not having a lot of nerve pain then we can.

PATIENT Q091
What's nerve?  How.

DOCTOR Q091
You know with the numbness, burning, tingling pain fingers, toes, shooting pains that go down the legs into the feet or down the back, into the buttocks um.

PATIENT Q091
Nope don't have any of that.

DOCTOR Q091
Um sort of like um more of a burning inner pain than uh like a.

PATIENT Q091
Alright there you've got that set up, they're not sending all of these automatically are they?

DOCTOR Q091
No I think you have to call when you run out, even.

PATIENT Q091
Okay but I.

DOCTOR Q091
But I think.

PATIENT Q091
The one that I ran out of was.

DOCTOR Q091
Which one did you run out?  Oh I see what you're saying um so the cetirizine you'll get automatically because it's a new medicine.  The other ones I think what I did was just renew and so if you find that you're getting low on the pills just call them and say hey I need them by next refill.  You have plenty of refills now and you'll be getting 90 day amounts.

PATIENT Q091
Okay so.

DOCTOR Q091
@@@.

PATIENT Q091
Maybe I should quit the gabapentin and see what happens.

DOCTOR Q091
I was going to ask you, that gives you one less pill to take.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
We could see, sometimes gabapentin makes people feel a little tired.  I don't know if that's been a problem but it might give you more, I don't know so.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah I fall asleep reading the paper.

DOCTOR Q091
So we could give it a try.  The way we do it is you're taking 300 mg twice a day, what I would suggest is we usually taper it so you don't stop cold turkey.  Um take one pill for about a week, just to let your body get accustomed to it and then we can probably stop it completely.  You're not on a very high dose.  We can actually have, gabapentin can be a very high dose for people with a lot of nerve pain.  But with arthritis we don’t really see a lot of nerve pain, we see more of an inflammation pain, an achy pain and with nerve issues we see a lot of people with diabetes or things like that and you don't have any issues with those types of things so.

PATIENT Q091
Alright I'll.

DOCTOR Q091
You can give it a shot.

PATIENT Q091
I'll cut it back to one and see if it makes.

DOCTOR Q091
Cut it back to one and if you start to feel like your pain is getting worse, then by all means we can keep it on there.  There's no real side effects or toxicities to gabapentin so if its.

PATIENT Q091
Except sleepiness.

DOCTOR Q091
Of the gabapentin yes.

PATIENT Q091
This is one of the things that bothers me.

DOCTOR Q091
You do, it can cause some sleepiness.  Vicodin can cause a little sleepiness too.  The Vicodin pills can do that.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
So

SECOND PERSON Q091
Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
So you know try it and see how you feel.  If you don't notice any difference after a week just stop, stop the medicine completely.

PATIENT Q091
Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay um and then you don’t have to call.  I'll keep it on your list for now just in case but you don't have to call for a refill if you're not using it obviously and so the next time you come we'll discontinue it completely if you're not taking it.

PATIENT Q091
Alright.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Cetirizine?

DOCTOR Q091
Right. 

SECOND PERSON Q091
So what does that do?

DOCTOR Q091
Uh so its, its for allergies.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Is that the new one?

DOCTOR Q091
That was the new one.

SECOND PERSON Q091
The one you were adding.

DOCTOR Q091
It's, you've heard of it as Zyrtec, yeah that would be a 10 mg pill that you can just take one time.

PATIENT Q091
Oh that and the one that I'm out of which was the uh.

DOCTOR Q091
The vitamin D.

PATIENT Q091
Vitamin D.

DOCTOR Q091
That one should be on its way.  If you don't get it in the next week, call them, call the Pharmacy.

PATIENT Q091
Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay cause it should be coming.  You have a little time.  You said you took your last one on the 15th.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah the 15th.

DOCTOR Q091
So call them in the next week if you don't see it in the mail okay.  And the Zyrtec just take it, you know, once a day.  If your allergies seem to be worse when you wake up in the morning take it when you get up in the morning and it should last you throughout the day okay.

PATIENT Q091
Is that quick acting?

DOCTOR Q091
Uh it should start taking effect in the first half hour to hour you take it.

PATIENT Q091
Sometimes my nose runs all day long.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah um and you can use over-the-counter stuff too if you have a lot of.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah there was one I read that said if you have glaucoma ask your doctor before using it and that was the one I got at Cosco.

DOCTOR Q091
Which one was that?

PATIENT Q091
They called it an allergy pill.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh just.

PATIENT Q091
They don't have a name on it.

DOCTOR Q091
Oh.

PATIENT Q091
Allergy.

DOCTOR Q091
Well bring it in next time if you want to talk about it cause I'll need to see what ingredients are in it and we can talk to the eye doctors about that okay.

PATIENT Q091
So I haven't wanted to take that.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah.

PATIENT Q091
And that made me sleepy if I remember.

DOCTOR Q091
Allergy pills can sometimes make you a little sleepy.  They can also make you feel a little bit dry cause.

PATIENT Q091
I have yeah.  

DOCTOR Q091
So.

PATIENT Q091
Is this what I'm getting, also make you sleepy?

DOCTOR Q091
I don't think so.  I think this one is a good one for the daytime um let me just see, I'm looking at the side effects.  There are like some of those decongestants out there they recommend you only take them at night um.  So yeah some people can be drowsy.  So see how you feel, you can take a half also of this medication.  If it works you can just have a half, 5 mg.

PATIENT Q091
Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
Uh and see how that goes okay.  Any other questions for me?

SECOND PERSON Q091
I actually feel great.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.  Well, just call me if anything comes up okay.

PATIENT Q091
That's a joke.

DOCTOR Q091
Well I know but what you can do is call the scheduling number.  I admit it doesn’t always work, call the general clinic schedule number and say I want to leave a message for DOCTOR and they will send me an e-mail and I'll be able to get back to you in the next couple days.  If not.

PATIENT Q091
You're only in here on.

DOCTOR Q091
I'm only in here for one week and then I'll be @@@ four weeks and then I'm in @@@ and then I'll be back in five weeks.  So I'm here one week out of every five.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Hmm.

DOCTOR Q091
Is how it works now?

PATIENT Q091
So check your e-mail.

DOCTOR Q091
But I still get my e-mails even when I'm in the hospital and I can give you, I can call you without a problem okay.

PATIENT Q091
Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
So they'll schedule you for my clinic um, what do you, do you come every six months to see me?

SECOND PERSON Q091
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
Is that right?  So that'll be around September time and like I said we'll look for some labs.  I'll look at the labs and see if you, you know.

PATIENT Q091
I usually have blood tests before.

DOCTOR Q091
It worked well that way because then we can go over them when you're here.  So plan on a couple weeks for the blood tests.  Let's see uh yes.

SECOND PERSON Q091
@@@.

DOCTOR Q091
Yes they're not going to @@@.  A little disconcerting.

SECOND PERSON Q091
You don't have anything to walk on.

PATIENT Q091
@@@.

DOCTOR Q091
I know they're doing some constructions right off the.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Thank you.

PATIENT Q091
Thank you.

DOCTOR Q091

SECOND PERSON Q091

DOCTOR Q091
I hope you have a lovely day.  Here's your folder and you check out with one of these nurses, people at the desk here okay.  Bye.  @@@.

PATIENT Q091
And they'll make the appointment?

DOCTOR Q091
I don't think I can make it that far.  I don't think they make an appointment that far ahead.  You'll get a reminder letter okay.

SECOND PERSON Q091
That helps.

PATIENT Q091
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q091
Yeah you'll get it like five months before the six months.

SECOND PERSON Q091
Okay.

DOCTOR Q091
Okay.

SECOND PERSON Q091
