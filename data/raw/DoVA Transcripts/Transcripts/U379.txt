DOCTOR U379
Yeah.

PATIENT U379
And that one's the next month.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah, it is.  

PATIENT U379
And they put this up to you and I had this special ladder, even when I get up to the steps.  I don't know what they trying to do to me, what do you think?

DOCTOR U379
Well it's because they saw this thing in your, in your lungs.

PATIENT U379
Yeah it's been there a long time.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah.

PATIENT U379
That's what they told me, we been checking it for a long time but now they said it moved some or something.

DOCTOR U379
So when we got this other one in July, you know to follow up, it said you had a 2 x 1 cm sized mass in the right upper lobe of your lung.  So the top part of your right lung.  This was new since previous exams uh and then that's when they recommended that maybe you needed a PET scan which is another CT scan.

PATIENT U379
Yeah I said I'd go up for that.

DOCTOR U379
Um I don't think they noticed this before that time.

PATIENT U379
Yeah it's been since, that's been since 95, 96, it's been a long time.  That gentleman was checking it all the time.  Check me one time it was six months then they went to a year to check it.

DOCTOR U379
Is that right?

PATIENT U379
Yeah.

DOCTOR U379
But they're saying that it wasn't there before.

PATIENT U379
Yeah it's been there since 96, 95 I think DOCTOR started checking that out.

DOCTOR U379
Here at the VA?

PATIENT U379
Yeah.

DOCTOR U379
Okay.

PATIENT U379
I told them that uh to go back and it's been there but then they said it moved or something or other.

DOCTOR U379
Uh they're saying it's new because it's moved.

PATIENT U379
Yeah it moved or something but no we've been checking that for a long time.  It's been there and what not.

DOCTOR U379
And I read their note cause this is beyond me you know.

PATIENT U379
It is?

DOCTOR U379
Yeah.  These are people that, if there's something they see that's abnormal they take control and so it's uh a cancer doctor DOCTOR and lung doctor, DOCTOR you'll see them.

PATIENT U379
Yeah man we @@@ I'm on my last leg or something.  Gee whiz, a guy, you could let your daughters know, your children know and boom, boom, boom, like huh?  And I just kept quiet.  Why do they want to talk to the doctor, she called me and she called me.

DOCTOR U379
July 19th is when they first talked about it.

PATIENT U379
Yeah.  Man.  It's when they went into my @@@ July 19 I'm thinking.  Then they send me to X-Ray.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah.

PATIENT U379
Then they saw something in the x-ray and send me to CAT scan and then they saw something then it wasn't nothing they could reach then they send me out to the other place out in Hinesdale to it was a. 

DOCTOR U379
A PET scan.

PATIENT U379
PET scan and showed more then I go and take this breathing thing for the you know here and.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah that's what happened so, you had it before but now it's bigger.  That's what it is.  So even though it was slow it's gotten bigger and that's what concerned them.  I'm reading it right now.

PATIENT U379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U379
And they wanted to talk about it but imaging was reviewed, you used to smoke.

PATIENT U379
Yeah a long time ago.

DOCTOR U379
A CT scan of July just to look at it and they saw the 2 x 1 cm mass.

PATIENT U379
Yeah.

DOCTOR U379
Then they compared it to a CT imagining back in 2005.

PATIENT U379
Yeah what's way, back in 2005.

DOCTOR U379
And looking back at it, it was present.

PATIENT U379
Yeah.

DOCTOR U379
But now it's bigger and that's what worries him, that it grew, why did it grow.  If it was stable it wouldn't have grown that much, that's why.

PATIENT U379
Yeah but what would make it grow?

DOCTOR U379
But that's what they're worried that if it's a malignant cancer that's the only reason something like that would grow.

PATIENT U379
But shouldn't I have some kind of symptom or something you know to.

DOCTOR U379
True, no you're right.  You would be weak and would have probably more of a cough.  You'd probably feel you know like you're not gaining weight.  Let me look at your weight.

PATIENT U379
No and I know what, I know the weight change, I know what's wrong with the weight.

DOCTOR U379
You've lost weight or you've gained weight?

PATIENT U379
I've lost weight.  I knew this.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah.

PATIENT U379
But doc see, I know I weighed 160-165 the most but I'm trying to get, my weight is 150-55.

DOCTOR U379
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U379
See but I, after some years I got older I kept gaining a little more weight so like where I can stay home more and eat more but now I'm trying to get on, see the number on my pants is 34.

DOCTOR U379
@@@.

PATIENT U379
I'm down to 34 just about.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah.

PATIENT U379
So I got to be around 160, I used to be 160-165.

DOCTOR U379
Hmm.

PATIENT U379
To be my 34.

DOCTOR U379
Okay.  I could talk to your daughter and I'll try to call her like in the afternoons.  It's kind of hard for me to call in the afternoon but.

PATIENT U379
I know.

DOCTOR U379
But, so they're saying that this could be consistent with cancer and that's why they wanted to get the PET scan to see if it's spreading and the PET scan that – showed them that you have some findings also in the middle of your chest, not just on the right and something right over your kidneys.  That doesn't mean that you have the cancer but there's sure something there.  So at this point they feel that the only way they can confirm if it's cancer or not is to get a sample of it.

PATIENT U379
Yes.

DOCTOR U379
So that's what they're recommending to you.  That's when you know DOCTOR.

PATIENT U379
Right.

DOCTOR U379
And he told you that he recommended the biopsy.

PATIENT U379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U379
And you agreed right?

PATIENT U379
Right, right, you know it doesn't matter to me cause I just had, I have no kind of symptom but you know I rest through it and like I say when I said, when I gained weight like past the 160 or 65 you know I get very short then.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah I know.

PATIENT U379
And it was like uh I can't carry a lot of weight cause I get it up here.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah.

PATIENT U379
And then so I can't carry weight up here.

DOCTOR U379
So I think it's worth investigating.  You know obviously you already said yes.

PATIENT U379
Yeah I already said yes, yeah I did.

DOCTOR U379
@@@.

PATIENT U379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U379
I just apologize if it felt like they were telling you you're on your last leg.  I really don't want you to feel like that.

PATIENT U379
Oh no, I just but he just talk, you know he.

DOCTOR U379
I think they just wanted to let your family know.

PATIENT U379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U379
And then, just so they could be ready.  It could be nothing, it could be something.

PATIENT U379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U379
But information, I think that's what it is.  Maybe that's what DOCTOR wanted to say, just let your family know.

PATIENT U379
Hmm.

DOCTOR U379
You know, just so they know because the next thing you know if something does happen why were they doing this, why did this happen?

PATIENT U379
Hmm.

DOCTOR U379
You know.

PATIENT U379
Yeah.

DOCTOR U379
I think that's all it is.  I think he just wants your daughter to know everything that's going on.

PATIENT U379
I think she talked to DOCTOR about it already.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah he did but she also wanted to talk to me about it.

PATIENT U379
Yeah.

DOCTOR U379
Okay.  So I'll try to call her today or tomorrow.

PATIENT U379
Hmm.  Yeah you can call her anytime but she's home for sure if you call her in the afternoon.

DOCTOR U379
Okay.

PATIENT U379
Yeah.

DOCTOR U379
Okay well then what we'll do is - and this biopsy is scheduled for when do you know?

PATIENT U379
The 11th of September.

DOCTOR U379
The 11th of September.

PATIENT U379
Yeah I just talked with the nurse yeah what I got to do.

DOCTOR U379
And you're on Coumadin right?

PATIENT U379
Yeah she got to get it through the @@@ you know when they take me off from the Coumadin.

DOCTOR U379
Maybe we'll start a Lovenox injections.  That way you wouldn't have to get admitted to the hospital.

PATIENT U379
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR U379
Because you know when you're on Warfarin.

PATIENT U379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U379
You have to stop it.

PATIENT U379
What.

DOCTOR U379
We still have to give you medications so you won't clot.

PATIENT U379
But they said I might take it before the.

DOCTOR U379
So the urologist did the.

PATIENT U379
No for the, no for the um @@@ for the @@@.  They just took me off, I didn't take nothing.  They haven't put me on nothing.

DOCTOR U379
Oh you didn't switch, is this for afib?

PATIENT U379
You just took me off for the six days.

DOCTOR U379
And he didn't give you injections or anything?

PATIENT U379
No they don't give me nothing.

DOCTOR U379
Let me see.  Let me look in my old notes.  It's only because of your heart.  You're heart, your irregular rhythm.

PATIENT U379
Right.

DOCTOR U379
That's why you're on Coumadin.

PATIENT U379
Yeah that's what happened.

DOCTOR U379
That was because of clots back in the day right.

PATIENT U379
Oh no, no, no, that was for the since they found out I had an irregular heartbeat.

DOCTOR U379
Oh yeah.

PATIENT U379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U379
Okay so he @@@ to come off.

PATIENT U379
Yeah that's what he said except for days within that date, they might have to give me the shots or something like that.  I said well @@@ before you don't give me nothing and I was off for six days.

DOCTOR U379

PATIENT U379
So they had put me to sleep for this and that.  They gave me anesthesia and all that stuff.

DOCTOR U379

DOCTOR U379
And you've been taking all your medications today?

PATIENT U379

DOCTOR U379
Move your legs.

PATIENT U379
You know I only take the lisinopril once a day, 30.

DOCTOR U379
Alright.

PATIENT U379
Yeah I woke up this morning and that's what I take this morning.

DOCTOR U379
And you took it this morning right?

PATIENT U379
Yeah before I took my medicine.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah.

PATIENT U379
And it was 180 something over 1 something.

DOCTOR U379
And did you um, you didn't change your medications.  You've been on this for a while right?

PATIENT U379
Yeah the lisinopril @@@ from the @@@.

DOCTOR U379
Alright.  Just relax.  Alright. It’s high.

PATIENT U379
Now it's 200 huh?

DOCTOR U379
Yeah it's like 160.

PATIENT U379
Oh then it's gone down some, it was 181 or 182 when she was taking.  It was 180 something before I took it before I took my medicine.  I took it in the morning around 9 o'clock.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah.

PATIENT U379
It goes like that.  So then it goes all the way till it gets numb.  @@@ keep looking.  Anyway I took it again it'd be down to like 130 and then 130, 120 and sometime I take it it'll be 160.  Take my meds and it'll go down to 140, 130.  It's gone down some already cause it was 187 when she took it.

DOCTOR U379
Let's see what I got for you last time.  We've been battling this.

PATIENT U379
Yeah.  @@@ changing medicine, then after a while you've check it later on so it went down.

DOCTOR U379
Lisinopril 30 mg right?

PATIENT U379
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U379
And when I took it then it was 120-128.

PATIENT U379
Yeah.  So what should I do?

DOCTOR U379
You been checking it at home?

PATIENT U379
I check it at home every so often.  I get tired @@@.

DOCTOR U379
And what was it like?

PATIENT U379
Oh I didn't check for a while.  I been here, like I said sometimes I get up before I take the medicine it's 160 or 170 or something like that.  I take my medicine and about three hours later check it and it's down to 140, 130, 134 stuff like that and if I stay around long enough it goes down to 128 and stuff like that.  So actually it's kind of a weird. I said the hell with it.  Like I said the only time I feel bad is when it goes below 120.  When it go down like in the 105 and stuff like that then I get a little off balance but other than that I feel fine.

DOCTOR U379
Oh your blood pressure was high even before the operation.

PATIENT U379
Uh-huh.  Before the surgery they did, that what they do.

DOCTOR U379
Were on hydrochlorothiazide before?

PATIENT U379
Uh some time ago yeah, yeah they took me off of that stuff.  It was going too low at night; it was going down to the 80s.  Yeah going down to 80s yeah take me off the meds man.  It'd get me kind of woozy at night, off balance.  During daytime or like nighttime.

DOCTOR U379
I think we might have to go back up on your lisinopril.

PATIENT U379
I, they at 30.

DOCTOR U379
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U379
Yeah what is that 10, 20, then they got 30.

DOCTOR U379
So the lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide, both continue b.i.d. @@@

PATIENT U379
And they changed my urine type medicine, the prostate cause we just had too much.

DOCTOR U379
Who stopped your hydrochlorothiazide?  I did?

PATIENT U379
Yeah.  You stopped that and you changed my prostate medicine here for the urine tract.

DOCTOR U379
Yeah.

PATIENT U379
You got that stopped, you changed that too.  That's when I had to go back to GU cause it started interfering with my tract so I went back to GU.

DOCTOR U379
Okay, alright.

PATIENT U379
They put me on something.

DOCTOR U379
