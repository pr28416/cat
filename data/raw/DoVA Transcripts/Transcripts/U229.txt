PATIENT U229
Yeah, right.

DOCTOR U229
Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  We should get you on a trial of Flomax.

PATIENT U229
Flomax?

DOCTOR U229
Chances are your prostrate’ s pretty big.

PATIENT U229
Okay.

DOCTOR U229
Flomax @@@.  There are two medicines they use in prostate whenever the prostate is a little big.  It’s something we use with guys. The prostate is kind of sort of a bitch of an organ in terms of you know, as we get older it gets bigger and it causes more problems.

PATIENT U229
Yeah.  I see @@@, you know, you know they been doing @@@.  Just started doing it.

DOCTOR U229
Yeah, I know.  It is, fortunately, we have some really, really good medications to treat symptoms of BPH.  That is probably what you got.  Um, going to have to do a rectal though and I know it’s not the more pleasant in the world, @@@.

PATIENT U229
Okay.

DOCTOR U229
Make sure you don’t have any sort of masses or anything back there, you know, that could be possible cancer.  I am not saying you have cancer.  Most likely you have just some enlargement of the prostate which is stuff that guys get as they get older.  

PATIENT U229
Oh, okay.

DOCTOR U229
So it most likely what it is.  Um, any back pain at all, that you have had?

PATIENT U229
@@@ goes around my waist.  

DOCTOR U229
But that is nothing new right?

PATIENT U229
No.

DOCTOR U229
Okay.  Okay.  Sounds good.  Um, your blood pressure is doing great today.

PATIENT U229
Yes.

DOCTOR U229
I am really happy with where it is at.  Um, as far as @@@.

PATIENT U229
I take that every morning.  

DOCTOR U229
Good, good, good.  You are taking lisinopril 10 and amlodipine 10.

PATIENT U229
@@@ take less @@@.

DOCTOR U229
@@@.  You know what, it is going to be a little tricky because I want to give you a little bit of a water pill.  To help get get off that extra fluid, it’s going to help your legs but I want to make sure you are peeing okay otherwise it’s going to be really un comfortable.  You know, so maybe we will wait and see if the peeing symptoms clear up for a little bit and then once you go to the bathroom regularly with an average stream, you can start the water pill.

PATIENT U229
Oh okay.

DOCTOR U229
Okay.  It will help you, actually you might be able to back off one of the meds and substitute the amlodipine. We’ll work in that.

PATIENT U229
Oh okay.

DOCTOR U229
We’ll work on that.  I will talk to my boss and we will come up with a medication regimen that will be better for your legs.  

PATIENT U229
Okay.

DOCTOR U229
Okay.  Because amlodipine may actually make your legs swell up or not.  So may need to take that off and cover you with something for a little bit.  We will talk about it.

PATIENT U229
Oh okay.

DOCTOR U229
Alright.  Let me take a listen to you and then we will have to do the rectal.  At least a guy doing it and not a girl huh?

PATIENT U229
Yeah.

DOCTOR U229
Take a couple of big deep breaths for me buddy.  Alright.  Fantastic.  You have a good set of pipes on you man.  

PATIENT U229
@@@.  You said I need to get off them cigarettes.

DOCTOR U229

PATIENT U229

DOCTOR U229

PATIENT U229
Okay.

DOCTOR U229
Believe me I don’t like doing that either.  Like I said, luckily it is a guy doing it, it’s not a female. A little bit more. Have you ever had this done?

PATIENT U229
Nope.

DOCTOR U229
No?  Even I have had it done.  I had to go in the hospital one time because I was having problems urinating and they had to do it for me. I tell you, it’s not pleasant.  It’s got to be done.

PATIENT U229

PATIENT U229
Okay.

DOCTOR OUT:  49:35  DOCTOR IN:  64:40

DOCTOR U229
Alright, guy. I talked it over with the boss.  We are going to make a few changes to your meds today.  

PATIENT U229
Okay.

DOCTOR U229
I was telling you before that the Amlodipine can make the swelling in your legs worse.  So we’re going to cut that out.  No more Amolodipine.  We are going to start you on a water pill and a pill for your prostate.  

PATIENT U229
Okay.

DOCTOR U229
Okay so we are, I know we’re taking away one and we are adding two but I think we are going to really help the swelling in your legs.  

PATIENT U229
Oh okay.

DOCTOR U229
I think it’s really going to help it.  @@@.  And then we are also going to get you stockings to push the fluid back in.

PATIENT U229
What kind of stockings are these?

DOCTOR U229
They are called compression stockings.  Basically they are really tight fitting socks and the come up to right about here.  And they are tight fitting and they squeeze all of the fluid back into the veins.  Because what happens in your veins, veins normally take up blood from down here and they bring it back to the heart.  And veins have little valves in them so the blood moves up a little bit, the valve closes and it doesn’t come back down.  Your valves kinda stay open like that so the blood constantly comes back down. 

PATIENT U229
Alright.

DOCTOR U229
The pressure of the arteries taking the blood to the feet, and the veins trying to back up, that pressure is goes up down here and the extra fluid is pushed down into the leg.

PATIENT U229
Oh.

DOCTOR U229
Yeah.  If you keep putting pressure on this way, your heart is putting pressure this way, but the veins aren’t doing their job because they are faulty and so the pressure goes up and fluid leaks out.

PATIENT U229
Okay.

DOCTOR U229
Okay?  The trick is, let’s try to squeeze that fluid back into the veins, basically what we are creating is an artificial valve in your legs, with the compression stockings.  Sound good?

PATIENT U229
Yes, sounds good.

DOCTOR U229
Alright.  Alright, so let me um, we are doing to discontinue the amlodipine today.  Okay.  And let me get you that water pill too.  Alright and you can go to uh, actually go @@@.  

PATIENT U229
@@@.

DOCTOR U229
You got @@@.

PATIENT U229
@@@.

DOCTOR U229
@@@ water pill, too. @@@ checklist @@@ forget what needs to be done @@@. Here we are, one... two...   Prosthetics Department, stockings, three, pharmacy to pick up meds.  I added terazosin, and chlorthalidone.  Stop amlodipine.  Stop at the nurses’ station and get your vaccination.  Then go up to Prosthetics real quick and pick up your stockings so you have them before the weekend.  And then come down to the Pharmacy.

PATIENT U229
Oh okay.  Appreciate it doc.  Nice meeting you. 

DOCTOR U229
Nice meeting you man.

PATIENT U229

DOCTOR U229
Yeah, we got a lot of stuff done today.  

PATIENT U229
