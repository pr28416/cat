Time of Encounter:   @@@ 

DOCTOR M017
Are you PATIENT?

PATIENT M017
@@@.

DOCTOR M017
@@@.  

PATIENT M017
As a matter of fact yes.  I was here three years ago for testing for agent organe.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
And uh I haven't been back since but now I'm on your records because to make a long story short, @@@ nothing really hurts okay but what I'm trying to do is get myself moved over to the VA because my wife is retiring at the end of this week and by the end of the month I will be without prescriptions.

DOCTOR M017
Right okay.  Sounds fine.

PATIENT M017
Now I do have a list of things that I do take in case you want to see them.

DOCTOR M017
Now um, do have a primary care physician?

PATIENT M017
I do.  I have this @@@.

DOCTOR M017
Are you going to transfer everything here or are you going to keep your outside primary care physician?

PATIENT M017
Yeah that's why I'm here.  I really am between a rock and a hard place.  I've known this guy for 33 years.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
He's a good guy.  My wife likes to take to to him okay.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
I'll do whatever I have to do in order to get covered on the VA I'll do it.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  The only reason I want to know specific, I know who's going to be coordinating your health care.

PATIENT M017
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M017
Cause it's important that if you want just one person, so whether that's us or the other primary care physician that's up to you.

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
I want you to just have one person just so it's not two people putting in orders.

PATIENT M017
I can do that.  So what if I go to him for whatever reason and he gives me a prescription?

DOCTOR M017
You can get it here.

PATIENT M017
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR M017
Then you're primary.  If I'm understanding about this, you plan is to come here from your physician and come here for medications which other people have done as well.

PATIENT M017
Okay, let's try that, it'll work.  Why don't we go that way.

DOCTOR M017
And if you want to transition your care here then let us know.

PATIENT M017
@@@ okay.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
Exactly, you read my mind, right in the right direction.

DOCTOR M017

Usually people do well on the other medications @@@ what happens.  Did you ever have a cough with the medication and he said stop that?

PATIENT M017
No I had something before Diovan.  To be honest with you it was so long ago I don't remember but the Diovan has been working for me, knock on wood, and I'm not wanting to give it up, that's why I'm on it.

DOCTOR M017
Okay um and it as far as your family history goes, are your parents still alive?

PATIENT M017
No mother's dead and father's dead.

DOCTOR M017
May I asked what they passed from?

PATIENT M017
Uh my father, I think he died of a heart attack.  He was 73 years old.  He had open heart surgery when he was 60.  He had two bypasses.  He smoked a lot, he drank a lot and he did a lot of things that he shouldn't have done and uh, so you know when his time came he went to the hospital to be checked out and he was at Loyola.

DOCTOR M017
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M017
And then @@@ someplace and @@@.  He was in for observation and the next thing he died of a heart attack and my mother died at 86, old age.  @@@.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT M017
My mother she was a type 2 diabetic.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
And I never knew her to take any kind of heart medications.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
She took eye drops for probably glaucoma but.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  Do you have any brothers or sisters?

PATIENT M017
I have two sisters.

DOCTOR M017

PATIENT M017
My sister SISTER she had cancer of the lung way back when.  She's fine now and she had something with her hip and you know all kinds of things and I don't know what kinds of medications she's on, God only knows. 

DOCTOR M017
And the other one?

PATIENT M017
My other sister she takes probably an aspirin a year and she's on very minimal, maybe eye drops @@@.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
Very limited but she smokes, that's the only problem she's got.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  Did you have children?

PATIENT M017

Yes.

DOCTOR M017
And who lives with you?

PATIENT M017
My wife.

DOCTOR M017

PATIENT M017
No I'm retired.  I've been retired almost four years in June.

DOCTOR M017
And what did you used to do?

PATIENT M017
Inside sales. Phone jockey.  

DOCTOR M017
Hmm.

PATIENT M017

DOCTOR M017

PATIENT M017
No I do not.  I quit about 20 years ago.  Do I drink; you know occasional cocktail, scotch.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  And any other @@@ uh like illicit drugs or @@@.

PATIENT M017
No, no, no.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  This is just a laundry list of questions @@@.

PATIENT M017
Fine.

DOCTOR M017
Any weight changes?

PATIENT M017
No.  In a matter of fact, I was doing better well until Christmas you know, I was losing eight or nine pounds in August.

DOCTOR M017
I see.

PATIENT M017
The fluid.  @@@.

DOCTOR M017
And @@@.

PATIENT M017
No.

DOCTOR M017
Any chest pain?

PATIENT M017
No.

DOCTOR M017
Or palpitations or racing of the heart?

PATIENT M017
No.

DOCTOR M017
And um, how many pillows do you sleep on at night?

PATIENT M017
That's a good question.  You know when I was in the Navy they gave me pillows and I'd get down almost to the mattress.  I only sleep on one pillow and I hug the other and I have one between my legs.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
The reason I do that is because it helps my back.

DOCTOR M017
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M017
It's a knee pillow.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
The other pillow I hold to and my @@@ but and then I sleep on one pillow.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  And you don't wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air?

PATIENT M017
Uh no, but once in a while I maybe have a tickle and it doesn't happen every night but it happens from time to time, I think it's just dry air in the bedroom.

DOCTOR M017
And you'll cough?

PATIENT M017
Yes, I mean not anything going crazy.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
Cough a little bit, if I need to I'll get some water and that takes care of and I'll go right back to sleep.

DOCTOR M017
Okay and you cough up any blood?

PATIENT M017
No.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
If I ever do that, I'd be knocking on somebody's door, I don't play games with stuff like that.

DOCTOR M017
Okay and any nausea or vomiting?  

PATIENT M017
No.

DOCTOR M017
Any constipation or diarrhea?

PATIENT M017
No.  Why am I here then? (Laughs)

DOCTOR M017
Any blood in your stool?

PATIENT M017
No.

DOCTOR M017
And any rashes?

PATIENT M017
No, but with this crazy weather, but I no.

DOCTOR M017
Yeah okay. Alright and then as far as um what you've had in the past.  Have you had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT M017
Uh never.

DOCTOR M017
And why not?

PATIENT M017
Because my @@@ told me that I probably shouldn't, cause you know if you're over 65, which I am uh you know you should probably go in for it but uh I never, but my primary doctor he finally you know gives me the finger every.

DOCTOR M017
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M017
Whether or not, @@@ right now is that everything looks and feels good so he didn't think there was an urgent need for it.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  Have you ever done the stool cards?

PATIENT M017
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR M017
Do you do that once a year?

PATIENT M017
Uh as a matter of fact I just did one not too long ago, probably in July or August.

DOCTOR M017
Okay and that was normal?

PATIENT M017
It was fine yeah.

DOCTOR M017
Has there ever been blood in your stool?

PATIENT M017
No.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  And then that’s probably why, you can do either one; you can do the stool cards once a year or get a colonoscopy.

PATIENT M017
I mean he's a really good guy, very thorough and you know if @@@ knock me out and stick me in the hospital but you know, he told me from Swedish Covenant.

DOCTOR M017
Okay, alright.  I understand.  Um has he been checking your blood tests and all?

PATIENT M017
Oh yeah he checks it probably once a year.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
@@@.

DOCTOR M017
@@@ just so I can have those results as well.  Since we’ll be prescribing the cholesterol medication.

PATIENT M017
Yeah.

DOCTOR M017
But you know if we’re reaching the goal. And if we’re not, I can always go back to him and say do you think I should go off of it and use this.

PATIENT M017
Oh okay.  I understand that.

DOCTOR M017
But just so that we can @@@.

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
@@@ back to me.

PATIENT M017
And what if like they are over a certain age, @@@ over a year and then I could get another or no?

DOCTOR M017
Yeah.  Because if you're taking cholesterol medications.

PATIENT M017
Yes.  You make sure the blood work and everything else to make sure.

DOCTOR M017
Exactly.  Exactly and that would be helpful to have.

PATIENT M017
You bet, uh-huh.  That makes sense.

DOCTOR M017
Um and have you checked your PSA?

PATIENT M017
Uh yes he does that quite often, @@@.  Now I @@@ people ask, some mean old guy I don't like to see them, I don't want to hear anything about him.

DOCTOR M017
Right.

PATIENT M017
But I do know from the test that I went through this one operation at North Riverside not too long ago and whatever they did they took out a big vial this one time and this other one was piggyback and they keep on taking out vials and I hear a click and @@@.  After a while it’s just kind of@@@.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
Makes me go crazy.  So yeah the PSA is one of them.  There are seven things that they check for and that's one of them, that's one of them.

DOCTOR M017
And did you have flu vaccine?

PATIENT M017
Yes I did.

DOCTOR M017
When was that, what month?

PATIENT M017
Uh let's see, it was getting more cold out, it was at North Riverside and I had just seen my doctor, I went through @@@.  They said it was free but it wasn't free, they put it on Medicare, @@@ it definitely was probably September October.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
Yeah.

DOCTOR M017
And do you know when your last tetanus shot was?

PATIENT M017
No.

DOCTOR M017
Would have been more than ten years ago?

PATIENT M017
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  That would definitely recommend to your doctor be something we'd ask you to get.  

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
@@@.

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
And have you had a Pneumovax or the pneumonia shot?

PATIENT M017
No.  I never had the pneumonia shot, ever in my life.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  If this is something that you want to have, you just get one and then you don't need it anymore the rest of your life.

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
So you may consider that.

PATIENT M017
Oh okay, okay.  That's @@@.

DOCTOR M017
@@@ you don't need one.  Okay, why don't we examine you, how about that?  Go ahead and have a seat for me, please.  Do you check your blood pressures at home?

PATIENT M017
Uh I have one of those wrist things.

DOCTOR M017
Yeah.

PATIENT M017
Yeah.

DOCTOR M017
What do they usually run?

PATIENT M017
Uh 120/81, 130, sometimes it gets something crazy like 119/75, you know they fluctuate and my doctor doesn't think it's all that great but you know it keeps me in line.  I think that she had 150/80 but I probably get excited when I'm around new people you know.

DOCTOR M017
Can you bring your um sleeve up a little bit please.

PATIENT M017
Bring it up or take it off?

DOCTOR M017
Um either way I just want to, need to get the blood pressure.

PATIENT M017
I should have wore a short sleeve today.

DOCTOR M017
No that's fine.

PATIENT M017
If that doesn't work I'll take it off.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  I'm going to have you @@@.  Then I'll put the left one on my arm.

PATIENT M017
How it be hard @@@ your doing.

DOCTOR M017
Focused and relaxed.  I don't want you; you're holding your arm up.  I want you to drop it.

PATIENT M017
Okay, yeah.

DOCTOR M017
Pretty good, 136/88.

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
Not as high as the nurses reading.

PATIENT M017
She said 150.

DOCTOR M017
Yes.

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
And like you said it can fluctuate.

PATIENT M017
Yeah, right okay.

DOCTOR M017
Especially just walking in.

PATIENT M017
Definitely walking.

DOCTOR M017
@@@ but it's high.

PATIENT M017
Well at least you know I'm telling the truth.

DOCTOR M017
Let me take a listen to your heart and breathe normal.  Deep breath in and out good.  Again and out, again out in and out.  Good.  Can you take your glasses off for me.  I'm going to look in your eyes.  Look here at my nose, uh-huh, uh-huh, good.  Open your mouth real big, ah.  You can put your glasses back on.  @@@ push me away; good now push me away with your legs, good.  I want you to look at your ceiling like that, good.  @@@ good.  Go ahead and lie down.  I'll check your abdomen.  There you go.  

PATIENT M017
I'm ticklish.

DOCTOR M017
You're ticklish. 

PATIENT M017
I'm already laughing.

DOCTOR M017
I'll try not to tickle you then.  I usually tickle @@@ patients.  Any swelling in the legs?

PATIENT M017
No.

DOCTOR M017
Good.  I'll help you get up.  @@@.  Alright so now.  The way with the medications, I'm going to start the Diovan.

PATIENT M017
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M017
Before I @@@ some of the medications we don't have on our formulary or it's not in the combo pills and we have to order them separate.

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
Let me see if they have the Diovan, they do.  @@@.  Is that one today?  

PATIENT M017
Yes.

DOCTOR M017
Do you want it mailed to you or do you want it?

PATIENT M017
That's a good question uh what's easier.  Are they hard to mail?

DOCTOR M017
Usually people prefer to have them mailed because.

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
Because to tell you the truth the Pharmacy down here can be backed up.

PATIENT M017
Okay, a friend of mine comes here quite often and I've seen her a couple of times when I go with her and there's a lot of people and yeah.

DOCTOR M017
So what I can also do are three months supply with three refills, good for a year.

PATIENT M017
Oh okay.

DOCTOR M017
And @@@.

PATIENT M017
Uh.

DOCTOR M017
@@@.

PATIENT M017
It's 20/5 @@@. Or 5/20 it's 5 of the Norvasc and 20 mg on the Lipitor, that's how you get the 5/20.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  Um but we don't have the @@@ in our formulary.  What we have to do is go from one pills to two pills.

PATIENT M017
Lipitor and the Norvasc.

DOCTOR M017
Exactly.  So the Norvasc we'll go with 5.

PATIENT M017
Go with 5 yeah.

DOCTOR M017
And @@@ the Lipitor.

PATIENT M017
20. 20 mg.

DOCTOR M017
And then @@@.

PATIENT M017
Cyclobenzaprine.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.  @@@.  We don't have that so what we have is pravastatin but I don't know @@@.  And so @@@.  Lipitor is in the same family as pravastatin but Lipitor is a @@@ pravastatin or simvastatin.  

PATIENT M017
Hmm.

DOCTOR M017
So I can give you one of those alternate drugs but it would not be the same@@@ from atorvastatin to pravastatin.

PATIENT M017
Okay now @@@ I don't know you know.

DOCTOR M017
We'll order simvastatin.

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
Based on recent studies, @@@ simvastatin.

PATIENT M017
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR M017
So we'll order that.  @@@.

PATIENT M017
That will take the place of the @@@.  

DOCTOR M017
Norvasc @@@

PATIENT M017
And what do you call the other medicine?

DOCTOR M017
Simvastatin.

PATIENT M017
Simvastatin.  Okay.

DOCTOR M017
Oh the @@@.

PATIENT M017
@@@ yeah 10 mg.

DOCTOR M017
And how many do you usually have?

PATIENT M017
Usually we're prescribed 21, a seven day supply three times a day and I never really, I can't remember the last time I took 21.

DOCTOR M017
Okay, no problem.

PATIENT M017
Uh I'm really bad but I really should finish it up because once my back goes out it gets kind of crooked.

DOCTOR M017
I understand.

PATIENT M017
You @@@.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
@@@.

DOCTOR M017
Oh @@@.

PATIENT M017
Yeah really rough yeah.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
But anyway when it painful I try not to laugh @@@.  She has a good time with it; I tell her one of these days God is going to punish her.

DOCTOR M017
And the last thing is the eye drops.

PATIENT M017
@@@.

DOCTOR M017
Now I don't know if you want to have that @@@.  So I'm gonna have to step out and see what, cause the eyedrops I’m not familiar with, so I need to see what alternatives we can do um instead of the @@@ and I'm going to order those @@@ and be right back okay.

PATIENT M017
Okay.

DOCTOR M017
@@@ the rest of these will be sent right to your house.

PATIENT M017
@@@

DOCTOR M017.
Do you have enough at home right now?

PATIENT M017
Yes.

DOCTOR M017
@@@.

PATIENT M017
Yes I do.

DOCTOR M017
@@@.

PATIENT M017
Well where do they come from here?

DOCTOR M017
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M017
From here?  Okay.

DOCTOR M017
Okay.

PATIENT M017
You know I don't know @@@ but if you can mail them, just mail them. @@@.

DOCTOR M017

DOCTOR M017
