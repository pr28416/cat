@@@.

PATIENT S875
Yes.

DOCTOR S875
Okay.  Any thoughts of suicide or anything?

PATIENT S875
Yeah.  @@@ but.

DOCTOR S875
Um.

PATIENT S875
It's just sometimes you know just things I can't do anymore I just you know, @@@.  Time for me to give up.

DOCTOR S875
When did you start having these thoughts?

PATIENT S875
A while back.

DOCTOR S875
In the last couple of weeks or?

PATIENT S875
Maybe about a month ago.

DOCTOR S875
Okay.  What um, do you have a plan?

PATIENT S875
No, I don't have no plan.  I get to be in certain situations in certain areas then I think this would be a good way to go.

DOCTOR S875
Okay.  Do you plan on following through with that?

PATIENT S875
No.  After I think about it for a while, then I don't do it at the time and it passes and I just forget about it.  Like a couple weeks ago I was stopped by a train, so I am just sitting there, I was the first car there you know I like to think about it, just going up there and falling in between the trains and it was like I mean it was intense, and I was like, you know I could do this, you know but I don't know, the train passed, it was a long freighter so I sat there a while thinking about it and it passed and I went on my way and then later on I didn't think about it no more.  Maybe it's just like they come in spurts you know.  It's just like there's times when I'll be sitting and I'm thinking and.

DOCTOR S875
Do you uh when they come in spurts, do you hear any voices or anything like that?

PATIENT S875
@@@ I feel like @@@ I don't know, it's like I'm not really there. I don't know how to explain.

DOCTOR S875
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of like.  No, no I hear you.  Is it kind of like an out of body thing?  Like it's more kind of primal, does that make sense?

PATIENT S875
Hmm.

DOCTOR S875
Or is that not the way to describe it?

PATIENT S875
I don't know.

DOCTOR S875
This is different.

PATIENT S875
I don't know a cycle.  I'm dreaming that I'm awake and dreaming this and you know somehow this stuff happens.  I can see myself, let's just say I can see myself walking doing these things.

DOCTOR S875
What are some of the @@@?

PATIENT S875
I don't want to talk about @@@.  That's how you @@@ psychiatrist @@@.

DOCTOR S875
Well, let me tell you what, like I know, I know we don't know each other very well but um like I'm afraid that you might, you might walk out of here today and act on some of these.

PATIENT S875
Yeah, I haven't done anything yet.

DOCTOR S875
I know but I think that's the key thing.  I think these are some of the things I hear you're kind of reaching out to me and I want to.

PATIENT S875
No you're just making me think about them.

DOCTOR S875
No, no, no, no, but I'm not a bad guy by all means.  You know I don't but I think that these are some warning things that maybe we should um; you know maybe this could be a little bit more emergent than maybe both you and I kind of think you know.  Like I don't want tomorrow something to happen to you after I just talked to you today you know like this is my opportunity of being your doctor and you know and knowing you today to maybe step in and you know, maybe save your life you know.

PATIENT S875
Well I got an appointment with my doctor.

DOCTOR S875
I know but what if you don't make it that far?

PATIENT S875
Oh I'll make it.  I'll make it, I'm still, I'll go.

DOCTOR S875
I know but I'm a little worried so.  Have you um as far as some of the dreams have you been jumped before is this all from the war?

PATIENT S875
I was never in the war.  @@@ in the service.

DOCTOR S875
Okay.  Otherwise you've been jumped before?

PATIENT S875

PATIENT S875
