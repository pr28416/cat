Not research, well cancer treatment and research.

PATIENT H279
Treatment okay, okay.

DOCTOR H279
I know, I'm sorry.  I canâ€™t take you to my other clinic, if I could I would, trust me.

PATIENT H279
Well, okay, I guess I have to.  Who do I get as a replacement?

PATIENT H279
Don't know yet.

DOCTOR H279
But if they're not good, we can, you know what well, make sure, let's see if I can get you in with, well I'll try to get you in someone else's clinic.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
Now how are you doing?

PATIENT H279
Good, real good.

DOCTOR H279
I heard you were in the Emergency Room.

PATIENT H279
Yeah.  Uh this, whatever this is, there's got to be a pinched nerve here.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Everything is mimicking I guess that's the way to say it.  When I had the fusion done.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
Everything is mimicking that.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
And now with that um uh I'm having these three and these three now, driving especially.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
Okay will cause numbness.  If I lay on my stomach at night and usually I lay something like this.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
I guess you know when I get on my back cause the numbness sets in.  Now and I, one thing that does help is the wristlets, applying pressure.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
Um prescribed, whatever they're called and they do help but it's not, I don't feel, that it's a complete cure.

DOCTOR H279
Right.

PATIENT H279
Um.

DOCTOR H279
Did they ever scan your neck?

PATIENT H279
Yeah.  They've taken a couple of MRIs and I don't know what the last MRI.

DOCTOR H279
MRI was March 29th.

PATIENT H279
Yeah I don't know what the results of that was.

DOCTOR H279
I'm trying to check something here.

PATIENT H279
But I did something to where this muscle started in, oh doc you could actually see a knot on the side of my neck it was that bad.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
And if notice the time we were in the ER.

DOCTOR H279
How long did you wait?

PATIENT H279
Well no I mean.

DOCTOR H279
Oh.

PATIENT H279
3 o'clock in the morning.

DOCTOR H279
Oh.

PATIENT H279
We left Michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning to come down here.

DOCTOR H279
Wow.

PATIENT H279
It was that bad.  Um yeah we drove in; we left there at 1 o'clock to come in.  It was, because it started, it actually started to affect my swallowing.  I went to take my gabapentin and I couldn't hardly get it down.

DOCTOR H279
Wow.

PATIENT H279
It was, but like I said you could see a knot on this side and one was starting on this side.  Um, the shot did help and the pills have helped but I think there's more to this than.

DOCTOR H279
So the MRI that you did at the end of March, the same person read the MRI back in August and it was unchanged from August but what it shows in August was a disk bulging, some narrowing of the canal.

PATIENT H279
Well that would be, that could be one thing right there couldn't it?

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
Narrowing of the canal.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
And now on the MRI can they tell how much it has narrowed or not?

DOCTOR H279
Well they just kind of give it a degree of either mild, moderate or severe.  Certain areas looked mild, other areas they're calling it mild to moderate, other areas they're calling it moderate to severe.

PATIENT H279
Yeah.  And maybe it's just the way, whatever I'm doing or something causes.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.  I don't know if you'd get any benefit from having you see the neck surgeons, but I can certainly go talk to my boss.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
And see what she says, if she agrees with that.  Okay, the neck spasms, have they improved?

PATIENT H279
Yeah it has since like, whenever or it was in November when it happened before and I came in.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
And I had an appointment so I waited a day but I didn't have any appointments you know coming up soon until I had you so that's why we came in and again it worried me when I couldn't even hardly swallow.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
I mean it took quite a bit to get the gabapentin down and that's when I said nope we gotta go in.  Um that has helped; it's still sore right in here.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
This muscle right here, uh still sore.  Um I'm having right there uh, where it starts to hurt again and then again over here, same spot, that muscle right there down the side uh but as far as the severity of it no.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
It's really decreased.

DOCTOR H279
I mean how, so if I were to send you to the neck surgeon, the spine surgeon, they're going to look and see if surgery is something that you should have done.  Is that something that you want to consider doing?

PATIENT H279
It, at this point, I would consider it.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Maybe after we talked, after I talked with them no, but because of, I can't get, it not only affects, has been affecting.

DOCTOR H279
If it comes back, well let's put it this way.  If it's affecting you to such degree that it's at least worthwhile to see what they have to offer.

PATIENT H279
Yeah and see what they have to say yeah.  I agree.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Because again I didn't come running in here from Michigan at 1 o'clock in the morning.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah, no I know, it's not like you're live next door.  I was like, yeah he must have had something major.

PATIENT H279
Yeah it was.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Serious, it was bad.

DOCTOR H279
Now have you seen Ortho here, or no?

PATIENT H279
Uh, oh boy.

DOCTOR H279
Let me see, cause they're the ones I would send you to.  Let me see if you ever saw them here.  Okay they put in a consult for you, a request and they put in, they made an appointment, I bet they didn't tell you the appointment, did they?

PATIENT H279
No.

DOCTOR H279
March 10th.

PATIENT H279
Gosh I try not to miss my appointments.

DOCTOR H279
I know its okay.  I will uh put in a new consult okay, that's why.  So okay, how are your sugars doing now?

PATIENT H279
Real good.  In fact with, you can tell the summertime or spring's here and the planting season and the farms.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
Because every morning I'm getting up and I can see, the sugars are so far down um.  It's, I have to wait for a little bit to be able to.

DOCTOR H279
How low are they going?

PATIENT H279
They're okay, they're okay.

DOCTOR H279
No, no, tell me how low.

PATIENT H279
Well some of them are down in the 70s.

DOCTOR H279
Oh okay, 70s are fine.

PATIENT H279
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR H279
But is it lower than 70s?

PATIENT H279
Uh there's been a couple of times uh during the day, during the day.

DOCTOR H279
How low?  Be honest.

PATIENT H279
I had a couple in the 30s.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
36 and 38.

DOCTOR H279
And what happened at those times, did you like not eat?

PATIENT H279
Yeah I was, I ate breakfast and then I worked, it was like 2-3 in the afternoon before I ate anything again and I knew it.

DOCTOR H279
You knew it okay.

PATIENT H279
The sugar was dropping so it was not the insulin is over, it's just.

DOCTOR H279
You weren't doing your part.

PATIENT H279
I wasn't doing my part.

DOCTOR H279
Okay that's fine.  Uh the only reason why we care to know how low these things can get cause if it happens regularly, high blood sugars, nobody wants high blood sugars.  So high blood sugars aren't going to kill you like that.

PATIENT H279
Right.

DOCTOR H279
Low blood sugars could, so if you are getting to a point where you're having it often.

PATIENT H279
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H279
70s is a normal blood sugar, just so you're aware.  Now people do get symptoms but it's not because they're getting symptoms of hypoglycemia because the sugar is 70, they're getting symptoms because their sugar had been like 180.

PATIENT H279
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H279
And now it's 70 and it's that drop, that change that is causing your symptoms, not the sugar number itself.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
Uh but if you, so you need to be aware that I know it's hard cause you're gonna be outside and doing all kinds of things but make sure you have a snack or something in your pocket because if those sugars get too low it could be dangerous.

PATIENT H279
Really, I didn't know that it was.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
Yeah high kills you in the long run and the low kills you, it can kill you in the short time?

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.  That's why I asked.

PATIENT H279
Okay then what I'll do is I'll just start carrying something.  I love the Lifesaver wintergreen candies so I'll just carry some of that with me.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah, just I mean just kind of have something every so often.

PATIENT H279
Yeah and it's, that's the only reason they have dropped is because of me not eating and you know you just don't want to quit, uh just a little bit longer and of course a little bit longer turns into a couple of hours.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT H279
So.

DOCTOR H279
Exactly.  

PATIENT H279
Yeah.

DOCTOR H279
Now did you take all your medicines this morning?

PATIENT H279
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR H279
And are you taking the simvastatin?

PATIENT H279
Yes uh-huh.  Um the reason, I run up the stairs.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
So I found out maybe that wasn't that long after I ran up the stairs.

DOCTOR H279
I'll recheck it, I'll repeat it don't worry about it.

PATIENT H279
I always take the stairs.  I don't take the.

DOCTOR H279
The other thing I was going to ask you is we; remember we increased your Neurontin or your gabapentin dose.

PATIENT H279
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR H279
Did you notice any improvement with that?

PATIENT H279
Yes, yes.  It does seem to, it has made a difference yes.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Um mainly when I, when I really notice it is mainly at night.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
That's when, I guess it's cause you're relaxing and now the nerve endings are, you're not thinking about it, are you thinking about it now because throughout the day.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
It doesn't seem to as though I need it.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
But at night um, you can, that's when it and it has really helped.

DOCTOR H279
And are you doing 800 in the morning and night with 400 in the afternoon?  How are you doing it?

PATIENT H279
Okay I was doing one in the morning and then uh whatever it is four at night, I'm sorry.

DOCTOR H279
That's okay.

PATIENT H279
I.

DOCTOR H279
Okay so the gabapentin is 400 mg caps.

PATIENT H279
Yeah gabapentin.

DOCTOR H279
Okay so how many are you taking in the morning?

PATIENT H279
One.

DOCTOR H279
And how many in the afternoon?

PATIENT H279
None.

DOCTOR H279
None and what about the evening?

PATIENT H279
Four.

DOCTOR H279
Okay so that's.

PATIENT H279
And that's again, a lot of times that's the only way it seems and usually I take it about between 7 and 8 o'clock.

DOCTOR H279
Does it get you, make you tired?

PATIENT H279
Yeah uh-huh.  Uh and then finally the hands and the feet stop and mainly it's the hands and feet.  Uh a little, once in a while in the legs but uh.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
But then I'm able to sleep and I sleep all night.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Yeah.

DOCTOR H279
So those things have been working for you?

PATIENT H279
Yeah that's what, that seems to be working for me.

DOCTOR H279
Let's not fix it.

PATIENT H279
Yeah.

DOCTOR H279
Let's not fix something that isn't broken.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
Um okay and then I got to put in for you to see Ortho.  Now, we could get some basic x-rays of your neck.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
So they can see what the hardware is that you have in there.

PATIENT H279
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H279
Where it is, the location and all that.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
Um but we don't need to repeat the MRIs or anything.

PATIENT H279
They may have x-rays of the neck.  It seems like I had some x-rays taken.

DOCTOR H279
I know.  They'll want it if it's too long ago.

PATIENT H279
So long, okay.

DOCTOR H279
To make sure nothing has happened in the interim.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
Um.

PATIENT H279
Now in the wintertime, it harder. I know last time the sugars were up.  I try and this past winter was just, I mean I didn't want to get outside to do nothing you know, it just was hard and then my son-in-law.  I got to tell you what my son-in-law did here, back in March uh, no, no it wasn't, it was back in February.  We had that one snowfall.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.  I'm listening, just so you know, to order stuff and what not.

PATIENT H279
Um anyway I called him, he called me once and yeah we had a freaking snowfall here and did some plowing and we got stuck.  He said yeah, he says I know.  He said you know what I got stuck today also and I said you got stuck; they live in @@@ Florida which is Cape Canaveral.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah, it really was yeah.  Now the blood work we won't do until you see um Endocrine.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
Itâ€™s not due anyways.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
And let me see what else.  Let me see how you're doing on your refills.  I'll give you cyclobenzaprine.

PATIENT H279
Yeah that's the one.

DOCTOR H279
So you've been using it?

PATIENT H279
Yeah I almost forgot.  I don't remember it from the first time.

DOCTOR H279
Oh.

PATIENT H279
Yeah he gave me a prescription here when I was in and that has helped.

DOCTOR H279
It helped.

PATIENT H279
Yeah because it started in again and so um I, they had told me that the Pharmacy was open; the Pharmacy wasn't open, anyway.  So when we got home I found the old ones and I got, my fault, I did not know that they had come.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Anyway so I started taking them again and then I got the other ones in the mail and sure enough it went back down again so it um did help, it's helping yeah.

DOCTOR H279
Okay good.  Uh your simvastatin expired so I'm going to renew that.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
The insulin syringes, do you use those still or no?

PATIENT H279
No, uh huh.

DOCTOR H279
No okay, well we'll just.

PATIENT H279
The 30 and 31 syringes no.

DOCTOR H279
Okay, clean up your list. What about adhesive remover liquid, do you still use that?

PATIENT H279
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR H279
You do use that?

PATIENT H279
Uh-huh.  Yeah I still got enough right now, unless it's, uh I still got half a bottle, one of those bottles like.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
That, about like that, I still got about half a bottle.  Cause sometimes these.

DOCTOR H279
So we'll not worry about it.  What about the nasal spray, do you use that?

PATIENT H279
No uh uh, no.

DOCTOR H279
Discontinue @@@.  Okay what about the Claritin?  Loratadine that's the antihistamine.

PATIENT H279
Well that must be over because.

DOCTOR H279
It's been over a year.

PATIENT H279
Yeah, yeah I'm going to say that must be old.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.  Alright so you've got a good number of refills.  

PATIENT H279
I wanted to ask you something.  I'll wait till you're done.

DOCTOR H279
Shoot.

PATIENT H279
What is this?

DOCTOR H279
What?

PATIENT H279
That little break, as it is right now.

DOCTOR H279
Oh this here.

PATIENT H279
And it'll open up, I'll put some, usually I put bag balm on them, put a band-aid on them and it heals up in a day or two and that's the only spot and yet you can kind of see how bumped up, it never goes down or anything.

DOCTOR H279
Hmm.

PATIENT H279
Always a bump as though it's healed.  Is that and it's been like that for, I can't tell you how long.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.  It's sometimes the skin, for whatever reason it just didn't heal like back to normal the way it should be.

PATIENT H279
And so, with working, especially right now.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
It seems to be okay for two or three months and then I'll be doing something and right now gloves, going on and off constantly, because you're hot, cold and working out so okay.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah I wouldn't worry about it.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
It sometimes, you know with diabetes you get poor wound healing and then if it doesn't heal like it should, @@@.

PATIENT H279
And that was my main concern just because of the diabetes so.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
Uh.

DOCTOR H279
Well if it were to like continue to be a problem then we'd have to, you know.

PATIENT H279
But it always heals up.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Um, bag balm, that kind of thing um, @@@.  Do you know what it is?  Whatever, have you heard of it?

DOCTOR H279
Uh uh.

PATIENT H279
It's an old remedy, that's one new one.  It's parabolic acid um, I forgot what I was saying but it's actually you put that on something like this.  The reason I didn't because I was going to show you today uh, within two days it'll get healed.

DOCTOR H279
Oh yeah.

PATIENT H279
Any sore.

DOCTOR H279
It's not like a red.

PATIENT H279
No it's a um yellowish.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.  It doesn't have Mercury does it?

PATIENT H279
No, no.

DOCTOR H279
Okay so I remember once I had this blister on my thumb that would not heal.

PATIENT H279
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H279
And I went to Italy, I was there for six weeks and aunt goes oh let me just try this stuff and she puts this stuff on it and it like the blister healed right away right, within a couple of days and so when I came back I was a teenager and I went to tell one of my friends who's a doctor.

PATIENT H279
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H279
And I'm like this stuff works miracles, blah, blah, blah and she goes yeah uh the government pulled that off the market cause it's got high Mercury content and I'm like oh for goodness sake.

PATIENT H279
I'll tell you a story, when I was oh 12, 14 years old, we were at my grandparents.  I won't tell you how it happened because I was stupid as a kid but I cut my bottom of my foot wide open.  My brother and I was playing on a tin roof and a nail was sticking up.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
Anyway, I'm going, we went in and my brother and I and I'm bawling my eyes out you know and my grandmother said to my mother and that's all I heard, Mary get the turpentine and I went blood-footed and all, I went running.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
But do you know, I never had any infection.  They finally tackled me, got me.  I thought it was going to burn and it was going to hurt, it never hurt.  Grandma soaked my foot in there and I didn't even know, oh several minutes and then bandaged it with the turpentine.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
And it healed; uh of course I always used to heal fast until the diabetes.

DOCTOR H279
Right.

PATIENT H279
But I never had a scar or anything.  You can't find anything and it was, it seemed to me even as a kid, as bad as the cut was.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
Uh turpentine and it never burned.  I was baffled.

DOCTOR H279
It's amazing.  It's amazing the stuff that that we used to use.

PATIENT H279
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Well, it's the first time @@@.

DOCTOR H279
Looks good huh.  Okay, it's better.  It's 130/60.  Thatâ€™s where you are supposed to be.

PATIENT H279
Yeah usually I've got that talking one.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
That I had for my brother before he died and whenever I take it, so that's about what it runs.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.  Deep breaths.  Okay, just breathe regularly.  

PATIENT H279
Question.

DOCTOR H327
Yes.

PATIENT H279
When you were on this side, I know you listen to the heart.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
But what are you listening to on this side?

DOCTOR H327
The heart sounds.

PATIENT H279
Oh really.

DOCTOR H279
You can hear the heart sounds go to various places on your chest.

PATIENT H279
Really.

DOCTOR H327
Yep.

PATIENT H279
I did not know that.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.  Any swelling?

PATIENT H279
Nope uh uh.  I have a question.

DOCTOR H327
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
You were just saying that okay the neuropathy in the feet.  I don't like it's from the diabetes, never gonna get better okay.  But there's time when it seems its worse and then times when it's better okay.  It's not the neuropathy that's gonna have them cut my uh.

DOCTOR H279
Your.

PATIENT H279
We just had a friend here.

DOCTOR H327
Was getting an amputation?

PATIENT H279
Yeah right.

DOCTOR H279
So it's not the neuropathy but what it is is, it's the neuropathy cause like you don't feel the way you should so you're more likely to get um, to step on things, get cuts whatever.  Now when you get those sorts of cuts and what not, then it's hard for the wound to heal and if the blood flow to the limbs is lessened, which it can be with diabetes, it just doesn't allow it to heal and it continues to fester and then it just gets worse and worse.

PATIENT H279
That's what happened. 

DOCTOR H327
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
A friend of ours, just a month ago had some, first it was just some toes and then they took her leg off up to her knee because she didn't listen, actually a friend of NAME.  It was too late.

DOCTOR H279
Right.

PATIENT H279
It was too late by that time.

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
Uh well when she finally did and the only thing that I have with my feet is the nail on the second toe and there seems to be a tender spot under it.  They looked at it at um.

DOCTOR H279
Podiatry?

PATIENT H279
Podiatry and didn't see anything.

DOCTOR H327
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Um and I didn't know if that was just maybe, maybe it's the toe, maybe it's the neuropathy.

DOCTOR H279
It's just.

PATIENT H279
That I'm making it feel that way.

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
But as far as anything else and it just, doc it scared me when.

DOCTOR H279
You know as long.

PATIENT H279
It's right here.

DOCTOR H327
As you're not walking around barefoot, walking and stepping on you know rusty nails, things like that.

PATIENT H279
Yeah.

DOCTOR H279
As long as you are always keeping an eye on your feet and looking at them, making sure that you don't break down, you're fine.

PATIENT H279
She checks them every night.  Uh I won't even walk around the house, I have a set up a pair of sandals that when I come in and take off my shoes or boots or whatever.

DOCTOR H327
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
Um on goes the sandals.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
That way cause we have three little dogs, two little Lhasa Apsos and a miniature Schnauzer, who I don't know why but they don't understand they have to put their toys away.  They get them out with no problem.

DOCTOR H327
Right.

PATIENT H279
You ought to see these three but they will leave their toys right where daddy can step on them and.

DOCTOR H279
Yes.

PATIENT H279
And then I have a couple of times but itâ€™s a good thing I've had my shoes or.

DOCTOR H327
Yeah make sure you're always wearing something.

PATIENT H279
Yeah.

DOCTOR H279
Okay.

PATIENT H279
Yep.

PATIENT H279
Alrighty.  Hypertension and the kidney?

(DOCTOR OUT:  81:31  DOCTOR IN:  84:03)

DOCTOR H327
Hmm.

PATIENT H279
I didn't know hypertension affected the kidneys.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah the kidneys can cause hypertension too, if the arteries.

PATIENT H279
Really.

DOCTOR H327
If the, see this here?

PATIENT H279
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H279
This is a normal artery.

PATIENT H279
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H327
Going to the kidney and it's one of.

PATIENT H279
Oh.

DOCTOR H327
If itâ€™s narrowed, the kidneys are kind of also part of your how your blood pressure @@@ so if itâ€™s narrowed, it can cause hypertension.

PATIENT H279
Okay sure.

DOCTOR H279
Yep but that's um, that's not a very common cause.

PATIENT H279
Hmm, I thought the kidneys you know went along with the liver taking care of everything and sort of filtering and but yeah it makes sense.  It makes sense I mean, if you've got something, especially of the kidneys.  I mean they're a big thing with the blood.  Yeah.  Will you do me a favor?

DOCTOR H327
Yes.

PATIENT H279
Well I don't know if you're allowed to but I hope you are, allowed to take my number with you.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279

DOCTOR H327
Do you have e-mail?

PATIENT H279
Yes.

DOCTOR H279
I'll just give you my e-mail address.

PATIENT H279
Okay, oh yeah, that'd be nice and I know you're gonna be busy so if I do e-mail you.

DOCTOR H327
Don't worry.

PATIENT H279
And you don't answer right away I understand.  I understand.  I think its well, going into this cancer research is just, can I ask.

DOCTOR H279
Yes.

PATIENT H279
A personal question?

DOCTOR H327
Sure.

PATIENT H279
When I mean personal, it's about this cancer thing.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
And I hate to say this and I know.

DOCTOR H327
Just ask me.

PATIENT H279
Is this, is this, other cancers that are curable that they just don't want to.

DOCTOR H279
Tell you about?

PATIENT H279
Yeah.

DOCTOR H327
No.  There are cancers that are curable provided they're found early enough so it's all about screening and early detection.  So.

PATIENT H279
@@@.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah so the problem is that a lot of cancers, because we don't routinely check.  You know pancreatic cancer; there are certain types of cancers where you're a goner.  So essentially I don't care what.

PATIENT H279
Why can't, if they can transplant a heart, a kidney, a liver, everything.

DOCTOR H327
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
Why not a pancreas?

DOCTOR H279
Because the thing is that by the time it's found it's so advanced that it's infiltrated all the areas surrounding it.

PATIENT H279
Okay you know I had heard that and uh, now it doesn't seem right but is that what it is?

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
But I thought like, Patrick Swayze, I thought that they had diagnosed his early what not early enough.

DOCTOR H279
The pancreas cancer is one of those where.

PATIENT H279
Here and now, it's gone.

DOCTOR H327
Yeah you're um.

PATIENT H279
Wow, wow.

DOCTOR H279
It's.

PATIENT H279
Okay somebody like me, my pancreas is not working right.

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
I mean that's why I'm taking insulin.

DOCTOR H279
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
Why can't they do a transplant on me?  I've heard over there at MCB at the Commission for the Blind, there's a girl there who is a diabetic who they did a cornea transplant on.

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
I haven't heard of pancreas transplants, they haven't done that yet.  

PATIENT H279
Why?

DOCTOR H327
I don't know.

PATIENT H279
I'm sure there's got to be.

DOCTOR H279
I really don't know to be honest with you.  I'm sure they're looking into it.

PATIENT H279
Yeah.

DOCTOR H327
But I've not heard of it so in terms of it being something that they're offering.

PATIENT H279
I can't imagine.  I don't know how like with a heart or a kidney.  I don't know how you would fit.  How do they sew that stuff together?

DOCTOR H279
Yeah I know it's amazing.

PATIENT H279
I mean who thinks this stuff up you know?

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H279
I just, but I remember when what's his name Bernard Shaw, the first heart transplant, the name was Bernard, maybe that might have been the last name.

DOCTOR H279
I can't remember the name.

PATIENT H279
Yeah that wasâ€¦

DOCTOR H327
They've come a long ways.

PATIENT H279
That was, that was space age.  Uh that was Buck Rogers and then some yeah.

DOCTOR H279
Yeah.

PATIENT H279
Uh and he didn't live all that long but it was still, it was still uh.

DOCTOR H327
Uh-huh.  So I'm not sure how long this e-mail's going to work.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
But this will be the new e-mail starting July 1.

PATIENT H279
This one.

DOCTOR H327
The EMAIL.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
Yep.

PATIENT H279
What can I say but thank you?  You know, you know where I was and you know where I've come and it's all because of you.

DOCTOR H327
Well.

PATIENT H279
You've given me the incentive, you have.

DOCTOR H279
Well I'm glad.

PATIENT H279
Uh because there sure could have been a lot of other doctors that I could have got who would not have been.  You know I remember once we were talking and you helped me get the pump and helping me when I'm down.  Well, put @@@.

DOCTOR H327

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H279
Okay so if you need anything you call.

PATIENT H279
Okay.

DOCTOR H327
Afterwards just e-mail, call me, I don't care okay, seriously.  Um and then otherwise we'll get you to a physician in either of these clinics, if they can't then they'll put you in whoever is taking over for me.  Okay.  If for whatever reason you don't like the new doctor you get, just switch to a different doctor.  Just FYI, youâ€™re not stuck. Okay just ask for a new doctor.

PATIENT H279
You know it'll be.

DOCTOR H279
I don't, that's the deal.  So we just that's the problem, if you don't like who they gave that's why you make a request for a new physician okay.  Well and I know you told me.  You can ask @@@ to follow you as well.  It's not a problem.  @@@ don't by fooled by the @@@.

PATIENT H279
@@@.

DOCTOR H327
Still if you don't like who you get, just switch.

PATIENT H279

DOCTOR H279

PATIENT H279

DOCTOR H327
