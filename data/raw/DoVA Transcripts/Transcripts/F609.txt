(DOCTOR OUT:  61:46  DOCTOR IN:  68:38)

DOCTOR F609
@@@ I mean @@@ sorry.  We're going to send you to get some labs because we have nothing in our records and I understand that you’re going to get your labs done at dialysis but.

PATIENT F609
Could I just sign the sheet that allows you to get a copy from dialysis @@@.

DOCTOR F609
No because it’s since 2006.  Um how about this, how about you take your lab results from here and take them over there.

PATIENT F609
Yeah, that doesn’t work.

DOCTOR F609
Yeah because we don’t have anything and it looks like all they're doing is just giving you the homemaker referral @@@ and we're not following you here, that's the problem.  But all it is is just a blood test; you know you get a blood draw and then you.

PATIENT F609
@@@ three days a week. You can’t understand. This is the worst pain on the planet, getting a blood draw and it’s three days a week as it is.

DOCTOR F609
That's what I'm uh asking you to do is go give some blood and then um how often do you usually come in here?  Cause you don't have any, you don't have any follow up on your diabetes.  I can give you any reminders um cause I don't have any records at all of what your blood sugars have been, um cholesterol numbers or any of that stored and you need to ask for your records to be sent over here, they're not in the computer.  Can you go to the Lab today?

PATIENT F609
I guess I'm gonna have to, I don’t want to.

DOCTOR F609
And.

PATIENT F609
Everything that you all do here it costs me money. I got full insurance at the Dialysis Unit.

DOCTOR F609
It would be better if they provide you with the homemaker if that’s all you’re coming here for.

PATIENT F609
I don’t think they can.

DOCTOR F609
How come? If you have full insurance through the @@@.  And did you get the flu shot already or?
