DOCTOR N270
Hey how you guys doing? 

SECOND PERSON N270
Doing good. 

PATIENT N270
@@@.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah.

PATIENT N270
@@@.

DOCTOR N270
It’s about time we saw each other.

SECOND PERSON N270
We got the @@@ taken.

DOCTOR N270
@@@.

SECOND PERSON N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
All the way back here.

PATIENT N270
This is about medication.

DOCTOR N270
Okay.

PATIENT N270
And most of all.

DOCTOR N270
This is it, wherever you want to sit, no you're fine.

PATIENT N270
Most of all it's about blood pressure medication.

DOCTOR N270
Okay.

PATIENT N270
And we did not have the world's best nurse.

DOCTOR N270
Okay.

PATIENT N270
She got 151 over something or other.  I've been taking it at home and I've never gotten that high.

SECOND PERSON N270
She was asking him inappropriate questions.

DOCTOR N270
What was she asking?  Do you mind me asking what she was asking you?

PATIENT N270
Huh?

DOCTOR N270
What was she asking you?

PATIENT N270
She was asking do I ever bathe, did I take a bath this morning.  Can I change my own clothes?  Can I eat by myself?  I've never been asked that and then she kept saying to somebody outside can I go, can I go and then she left.  So I told her.

DOCTOR N270
So, really focused on @@@

PATIENT N270
I told her this is about blood pressure medication and she, you know it was a losing situation.  Just to be sure you might want to take my blood pressure yourself.

DOCTOR N270
I'm gonna tell you my rule for blood pressure with my patients.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
If you're going to the trouble of writing all these down every day, I trust the numbers you're taking.  I'll check it again but even if it still comes back high today after that kind of experience my blood pressure would be high right now.

PATIENT N270
Okay.  She was the same one, by the way.  A couple of months ago we were here for four hours.  We were here till they closed.  She locked the door.

SECOND PERSON N270
Locked us in and left.

PATIENT N270
And then left so then the doctor had to open the door.

SECOND PERSON N270
Try to get the papers.

PATIENT N270
So she would know who she was treating.

SECOND PERSON N270
It's just so different.

PATIENT N270
I'm sure they've got rules here that make it hard to get rid of nurses but.

DOCTOR N270
Oh here, they can get rid of...

SECOND PERSON N270
@@@ finger in her ear and her nose.

PATIENT N270
Yeah that was weird too.

SECOND PERSON N270
Never saw anything like that.

DOCTOR N270
@@@.

SECOND PERSON N270
@@@.

PATIENT N270
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

DOCTOR N270
We're kind of getting off.

SECOND PERSON N270
Here is something like.

DOCTOR N270
If it keeps you from getting fired but.

PATIENT N270
Okay here's, I had been taking this for a long time.

DOCTOR N270
I'm going to pull up your chart while your @@@ down okay.

PATIENT N270
I was taking this for a long time.

DOCTOR N270
Yes you were, I remember.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.  My systolic is high so then DOCTOR, you know DOCTOR, that’s you, prescribed this.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah, the additional one.

PATIENT N270
So.  I been out of this for about a month.

DOCTOR N270
@@@

PATIENT N270
Just taking this and I'm getting good readings.

SECOND PERSON N270
So maybe you don't need the other one.

DOCTOR N270
I think you know the answer okay.

PATIENT N270
Don't take this anymore.

DOCTOR N270
We'll cancel that and take that one out.

PATIENT N270
Okay.

DOCTOR N270
If you're doing well on this one, this has a half-life of one day so if you've been taking this every day and it lasts all day and it's keeping your blood pressure fine, hey, less is better is more.  Let’s get rid of the one you don't need.

PATIENT N270
Yeah I used to cut them in half but then you told me.

DOCTOR N270
Just take the full thing.

PATIENT N270
Just to take the whole thing.  Okay and so that's.

DOCTOR N270
So you've got a good one that works well for you huh.

PATIENT N270
Uh here's.

DOCTOR N270
And you're breathing one.

PATIENT N270
Now here's the problem.

DOCTOR N270
Is DOCTOR still giving that one?

PATIENT N270
Oh gosh yes.

DOCTOR N270
(Laughter)

PATIENT N270
Uh, did you do this, DOCTOR, that’s right, okay.  You prescribed this because you said it was a better one to take than this.

DOCTOR N270
No this has a different one.  This has got both in here, albuterol plus ipratropium.

PATIENT N270
Anyway I can't renew this.  They tell me they didn't have it anymore.

DOCTOR N270
Let me look at this for you.  

PATIENT N270
When they told her.  He wanted me to take this one.

DOCTOR N270
Hmm.  Let me read my last notes to jog my memory real quick.  How's your shingles doing?

SECOND PERSON N270
Gone.

PATIENT N270
I had them 30 days.

DOCTOR N270
But it's gone.

PATIENT N270
Yes.

DOCTOR N270
Good, good, good.

SECOND PERSON N270
Well speaking of shingles.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah.  Vaccine.

SECOND PERSON N270
Did they ever get the vaccine?

DOCTOR N270
Of course not.  Why you know would the VA do anything efficiently.

SECOND PERSON N270
So that's really a long time.  They said they would have it by January.

DOCTOR N270
Let me check and see.  I know when I inquired earlier this month they didn't have it, you know what I bet they have.  I just, I usually don't hold my breath for such things.

SECOND PERSON N270
Well obviously you would have been dead a long time.

DOCTOR N270
Alright, let's see.  You're over 60.

PATIENT N270
Yes.

DOCTOR N270
Okay.  I do not expect you to live less than a year.  They actually ask me these questions.  

PATIENT N270
I took a bath today.

DOCTOR N270
You did take a bath.

SECOND PERSON N270
(Laughs)

DOCTOR N270
You don't have any blood cancers.  You're not taking steroids.

PATIENT N270
Uh uh.

DOCTOR N270
Have you ever had a reaction to gelatin, a medication called neomycin, anything like that?

PATIENT N270
No I don't have a reaction.

SECOND PERSON N270
I don't think he got sick from any medicines that we know of.

DOCTOR N270
Um, when you were younger, you never had tuberculosis, did you?

SECOND PERSON N270
No.

PATIENT N270
No.

DOCTOR N270
And you've never had the vaccine before?

PATIENT N270
Which vaccine?

DOCTOR N270
The shingles.

PATIENT N270
No.

SECOND PERSON N270
Yeah.  He gets just the shingle disease.

DOCTOR N270
Okay.

SECOND PERSON N270
I thought that the vaccine was new.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah it's been out for like four or five years, maybe a little bit longer.

SECOND PERSON N270
Is it that long?

DOCTOR N270
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON N270
I thought it was just this year.  This is the first year I heard of it.

DOCTOR N270
It's becoming to the point where now we know enough about it to say go get it.

SECOND PERSON N270
@@@.

DOCTOR N270
But before they had it we were just like do we give it, do we not give it, we're not sure, it’s only been out a couple of months @@@.

SECOND PERSON N270
Okay.  Maybe that's why I didn't know about it.  I had it in 97 and nobody offered me a vaccine.

DOCTOR N270
Still not?

SECOND PERSON N270
No.

DOCTOR N270
You're still indicated to get it even if you had the shingles.

SECOND PERSON N270
I had it in 97 but I @@@ had the shingles.

DOCTOR N270
How about now, did you get the vaccine?

SECOND PERSON N270
Not yet.  I'm gonna ask my doctor about it and I can see.

DOCTOR N270
Let me see uh, uh oh it looks like they may have it at the Pharmacy, so let me put it in, we'll see what happens.

SECOND PERSON N270
@@@.  He could get one dose today when we're done.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah.  Oh okay, here's what happened.  When you saw the pulmonary specialist back in November, okay because this time you didn't see DOCTOR, you saw this guy DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON N270
Right.

DOCTOR N270
And another, I think he’s Turkish or Syrian, a guy named DOCTOR.

SECOND PERSON N270
Yeah.

PATIENT N270
We've had Indian doctors, Syrian doctors and a guy we thought was from Turkey.

DOCTOR N270
Okay, you've seen a multitude of.

PATIENT N270
It's always like being @@@.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah so with the last guy DOCTOR he speaks very fast and so this is the way.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah.  He's a German guy.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
And he speaks really fast.  He actually says because he's a lung specialist, I think this one was working well for you.

PATIENT N270
It was.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah but now.

PATIENT N270
And they won't renew it.

DOCTOR N270
Well he just basically said in his notes, he would prefer you to be on this one and not this one.  He thinks this was gonna be better for your cough.

SECOND PERSON N270
And it hasn't been.

PATIENT N270
And you thought this one was.

DOCTOR N270
Which one did you thought worked better for you?

SECOND PERSON N270
We thought the other one.

DOCTOR N270
This one helps you more?

SECOND PERSON N270
Cause now, since he's been on this one, he's never stopped coughing.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah I'm not supposed to go against them because they're the boss but we'll make the change.  I'll write in my note you symptomatically noted that this is better for you and I think between the two, at this point, it's what makes you feel better you know.

SECOND PERSON N270
Yeah.  That's right.

DOCTOR N270
They're not, neither of these are gonna change what's going on inside your lungs, the chronic bronchiectasis, the mass you see, they'll always be there, we just want you to feel better.

PATIENT N270
Okay when you say you're gonna put this in for me.

DOCTOR N270
If you think that they cancelled the order for this.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
That's why you can't get any more of it.

SECOND PERSON N270
He can put it back in.

DOCTOR N270
I can put it back in.

PATIENT N270
Just put it back in.

DOCTOR N270
But I have to get rid of this one and I'll write in my note that we thought this was more beneficial for you and that's why we're switching it back okay.  And before I do that, let me listen to your lungs really good.  Can you take off your shirt?

SECOND PERSON N270
Here.

PATIENT N270
This is more powerful, I think.

SECOND PERSON N270
So give me your @@@.

DOCTOR N270
They have the same power.

PATIENT N270
Oh they do.

DOCTOR N270
This has the exact same power but this has an additional medication in it called ipratropium which works on a different part of your lungs.

PATIENT N270
So why don't we keep that then.

DOCTOR N270
We can keep that if you want this one.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
It's purely up to you.

PATIENT N270
Yeah this one, this one.

DOCTOR N270
It's the same amount of albuterol in both of them.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
So you want this one.

PATIENT N270
Decide on this one.

DOCTOR N270
Okay we'll keep it as the lung doctor suggests.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
I think @@@.

SECOND PERSON N270
So @@@.

PATIENT N270
He's treating our daughter.

DOCTOR N270
Oh is he, over at UIC.

SECOND PERSON N270
Uh-huh.  @@@.

DOCTOR N270
I'm going to check your lungs; can you take a deep breath?  Out.  Good, in and out, in and out.  One more.  @@@.  Any pain here?  Let me see you skin, any new lesions on your skin?

PATIENT N270
No.

DOCTOR N270
You notice anything new?

PATIENT N270
@@@ shingles .

DOCTOR N270
They got you a nice tie, high and tight didn't they.

PATIENT N270
That's my son, he's cheap.

DOCTOR N270
And this hasn't changed at all has it, the redness in the cheeks?

PATIENT N270
I don't know, the shingles is gone, 30 days.

DOCTOR N270
When was the last time.

SECOND PERSON N270
That was so gradual; I didn't notice what it was.

DOCTOR N270
When was the last time they had to freeze off some of the skin lesions from the Derm Clinic?  Dermatology.  Did they recommend that for you?

SECOND PERSON N270
Oh they did.

DOCTOR N270
The dermatologists freezing off like lesions.

SECOND PERSON N270
He took off something yes.  One time, the last time, remember?

DOCTOR N270
Do you check your skin every at least every couple of months, look for new lesions?

PATIENT N270
No, I should.

SECOND PERSON N270
We do once a year or two.

PATIENT N270
No we're just counting on Dermatology to do it.

DOCTOR N270
But you are still seeing them though right?

SECOND PERSON N270
Once a year.

DOCTOR N270
Once a year.  It's better if you do it yourself in between; the year long time between when you see them, only because a lot can happen in a year.

SECOND PERSON N270
Do you think this is something?

DOCTOR N270
Oh that's probably just from @@@.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah well.

PATIENT N270
I'll let her do it because I'm a bad spotter.

DOCTOR N270
Alright, you be the spotter okay.

SECOND PERSON N270
Okay.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
Let me see your legs.

PATIENT N270
Yeah spotters huh.

DOCTOR N270
Any swelling?

PATIENT N270
No.  Now everybody talks about that and.

SECOND PERSON N270
Maybe all the @@@.

PATIENT N270
I think its muscle, honest to God.

SECOND PERSON N270
Or a lot of water.

DOCTOR N270
It's probably just a touch of water, not a lot.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
It's @@@ socks @@@.

PATIENT N270
Everybody talks about that as if I'm gonna die from it.

DOCTOR N270
No, no, that's not the reason.  Uh you may just have thought it was, but I think.

PATIENT N270
But as far as lungs go.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah.

PATIENT N270
I go to the Health Club and work out strenuously and I do snow removal now.

DOCTOR N270
Really.

PATIENT N270
And I'm not getting shortness of breath, honest to God.  That's the good thing about it.

DOCTOR N270
Definitely, you'd come tell us if you were.  I mean that's.

PATIENT N270
If I were I'd tell you and I'd tell DOCTOR.  I'm coughing, I'm bothering her but I'm not getting shortness of breath.

SECOND PERSON N270
The thing is he doesn't usually cough while he's sleeping.

PATIENT N270
Well see when I get horizontal, I cough.

SECOND PERSON N270
While he’s up, he’s coughing all the time.

DOCTOR N270
Yeah but when you fall asleep it goes down.

SECOND PERSON N270
It seems to stop.  Cause I'm up and he's still sleeping, his coughing stops.

DOCTOR N270
@@@.

PATIENT N270
Okay I'd like to get this renewed.

DOCTOR N270
Ear drops, no problem.

PATIENT N270
I kept getting wax in my ears.

DOCTOR N270
How are you cleaning your ears?

PATIENT N270
Huh?

DOCTOR N270
You're not using Q-Tips are you?

PATIENT N270
Huh?

DOCTOR N270
Are you using any Q-Tips?

PATIENT N270
No, no, that's a bad thing to do.

DOCTOR N270
Right, just making sure.

SECOND PERSON N270
He has a brush that he uses to clean out his hearing aids.

DOCTOR N270
Okay, but when you put the drops in you just let it run out on their own right?

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
So it runs out, good.  Any questions?

PATIENT N270
No.  I was gonna ask if you could renew this but it looks like we've got enough.  Cause this certainly helps.

SECOND PERSON N270
What is it?

PATIENT N270
Ultram right,

DOCTOR N270
Tramadol?

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
It's a pretty good pain medication.  It doesn't have too many side effects.  What kind of pains are you using it for?

PATIENT N270
I use it after working out, doing anything strenuous and my knee.


DOCTOR N270
Yeah, that’s right, the knee thing.

PATIENT N270
It seems to work better than anything else.  I don't overdose it though.  No if it says take two I only take one at a time, just to ...  

DOCTOR N270
So when you do your snow removal, I guess you're gonna have a lot of work to do tomorrow huh.

PATIENT N270
I use a snow blower.

DOCTOR N270
Okay.

SECOND PERSON N270
He's got the snow blower all ready.

PATIENT N270
My son paid $350 for it to save my life.  But once in a while I use a shovel.

DOCTOR N270
How far out do you guys live?

SECOND PERSON N270
We're from Chicago, we live in.

DOCTOR N270
In Chicago.

SECOND PERSON N270
Towards the north side @@@.  There must have been a terrible accident today on the way @@@.

DOCTOR N270
Bad traffic.

SECOND PERSON N270
But they had a sign up even that there was an accident around Sacramento and it really, really was crawling so I really @@@ I think that by the time that we got there, they had moved away the vehicles.  Has he had blood tests in a while?

DOCTOR N270
Yeah, he had them just about five months ago.

SECOND PERSON N270
Okay.

DOCTOR N270
Which @@@ for him.  He's not on any medications that will mess up his labs so usually once a year is enough.  If something changes clinically or he's having some new symptoms then we recheck them but I think the next time you come in we'll get some repeat labs.  So let me make sure all your medications look okay before you leave.  Your inhalers they're all good, set-up for you for a year okay.

PATIENT N270
Yeah these are good.

DOCTOR N270
Your blood pressure pill is good until November.  You have all the refills you'll need.

PATIENT N270
Yeah.

DOCTOR N270
Uh.  You're still on, you don't need the gabapentin anymore right?

PATIENT N270
Huh?

DOCTOR N270
The gabapentin, the one you took for shingles, you're not taking that anymore are you?

SECOND PERSON N270
No.

DOCTOR N270
Let me get rid of that.  Uh oh it mentions, when was the last time you got a shot in your knee?  Are they still doing that? 

PATIENT N270
It didn’t work.

DOCTOR N270
Did it help at all?

PATIENT N270
It stopped working.

DOCTOR N270
The tramadol has been working okay though?  The Ultram, the pain medication?

PATIENT N270
That's all that's left.

DOCTOR N270
It's still helping though?

PATIENT N270
Huh?

DOCTOR N270
It's still helping?

PATIENT N270
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR N270
Okay.  That's good.

PATIENT N270
Those shots in my knees and I had a lot of them.

DOCTOR N270
Just not cutting it.

PATIENT N270
It stopped.

DOCTOR N270
I'm gonna refill this one cause this one's out.

PATIENT N270
Okay.

DOCTOR N270
So you're on 50, one tablet three times a day?

PATIENT N270
I don't do that.  I just take it one at a time.

DOCTOR N270
Okay.  And I'll put that in the mail for you or do you want to pick it up today?

SECOND PERSON N270
In the mail.

PATIENT N270
Just mail them.

SECOND PERSON N270
Could he get the shot today?

DOCTOR N270
Yeah.

PATIENT N270
Oh.

DOCTOR N270
I'm gonna send you to the Pharmacy as soon as I go talk to my boss.  I'll send you to the Pharmacy now to pick up the shot and then hopefully one of the nurses, we'll see if we can find a different one, will give you the shot okay.  Does that sound okay?

PATIENT N270
Yeah they can mail this.

DOCTOR N270
That and then this one you can pick up today if you'd like.

PATIENT N270
Okay.  Tylenol in the mail @@@ and the new inhaler keep.  

DOCTOR N270
Um how long does one of those tubes of earwax softener last for? 

PATIENT N270
I can't tell.

DOCTOR N270
How often do you use it?  Every day?

PATIENT N270
Every day.

DOCTOR N270
And then how long have you had that bottle for?

PATIENT N270
Well I've got a couple other ones that you know @@@ you know I really can't tell when they're out.  I squirt it on my hand to be sure that they’re not out.  I just want to be safe, yeah.  As long as we're doing this.  

DOCTOR N270
Let me talk to my boss real quick okay.

PATIENT N270
Uh Nasonex is the only other thing that I.

DOCTOR N270
It's in there, I already checked.

PATIENT N270
Okay.

DOCTOR N270
I'll be right back.

PATIENT N270
Thank you.

(DOCTOR OUT:  28:58  DOCTOR IN:  38:56)

DOCTOR N270
I'll have you guys go to the Pharmacy to get your stuff.

SECOND PERSON N270
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR N270
Uh @@@ get everything @@@ talk about this.  I thought it was less good use of your time if you're here waiting.  I don't think there's anything new I'm gonna tell you.  Get your medications.  Just swing by the door and I'll tell you anything else I want to change.

SECOND PERSON N270
Okay and what do we do with the shot?

DOCTOR N270
You'll pick it up at the Pharmacy, so it's at the Pharmacy.

SECOND PERSON N270
I know that.

DOCTOR N270
Bring it back to the Nurse’s Station here and they’ll be the ones to administer it.

PATIENT N270
Thank you.

DOCTOR N270
Have a nice day.

PATIENT N270
Oh you're keeping me alive.

DOCTOR N270
Be good.

PATIENT N270
@@@.

DOCTOR N270
