FIRST DOCTOR I907
Depending on what cancer it is.

PATIENT I907

FIRST DOCTOR I907
Um do you have a specific cancer in mind that?

PATIENT I907
Uh spinal.

FIRST DOCTOR I907
Spine like bone cancer or what?  It kind of depends on the type of cancer.  Cause some cancers are really aggressive right so you can have them grow really fast.

PATIENT I907

FIRST DOCTOR I907
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR I907
@@@.

PATIENT I907
I’ve been through this quite a few times with family members.  @@@ years ago they used to give um, used to harp on the seven  warning signs of the different forms of cancer and they backed away from that or maybe I just.

FIRST DOCTOR I907
Um.

PATIENT I907
Like if it was a lung cancer, you know coughing problems, blood or whatever.

FIRST DOCTOR I907
Yeah, that @@@.

PATIENT I907
Colon cancer you know there's blood in the stool.

FIRST DOCTOR I907
Absolutely.

PATIENT I907
Are they still harping on those seven warning signs?

FIRST DOCTOR I907
Like do they tell everyone about them?  Is that what you mean?

PATIENT I907
Well it used to be fucking media thing.

FIRST DOCTOR I907
Yeah, I’m not seeing it in the media as much.

PATIENT I907
Right that's what I'm saying.

FIRST DOCTOR I907
You're absolutely right except it's not that we um, that's sort of definitely the warning signs.

PATIENT I907
But generally when you got through uh physical metamorphosis that means that if you know, it's gotten to the point you know I don't know what stage you would call it.

FIRST DOCTOR I907
Right when you have symptoms probably.

PATIENT I907
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR I907
But unfortunately they’ve found, so many different studies to see where it is beneficial to screen people prior to having symptoms.

PATIENT I907
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I907
So certain stuff we do, for women, we do mammograms and we do pap smears @@@.

PATIENT I907
Yeah, for a man, it’s a PSA.

DOCTOR I907
