DOCTOR P664
Chemo.

PATIENT P664
That.

DOCTOR P664
Didn't go too well.

PATIENT P664
Darn near killed me.

DOCTOR P664
Okay.

PATIENT P664
I didn't want to live that way uh and you know I outlasted it and I feel great and I'm only concerned with a return of the cancer and I have a colonoscopy scheduled.

DOCTOR P664
Right.

PATIENT P664
So it's under control.

DOCTOR P664
Okay.  You could not, so how's your appetite been though?

PATIENT P664
Uh good yes, very good.  And my alimentary canal, as far as I can tell is functioning very well considering I lost a third of the colon.

DOCTOR P664
Okay.  So otherwise you think you're doing fine?

PATIENT P664
Yes.  Thanks to you good folks at Hines and my wife.

DOCTOR P664

DOCTOR P664

No.  I'm back on my bicycle and trying to get my conditioning back.

DOCTOR P664
So any symptoms of your heart?

PATIENT P664

DOCTOR P664
You're having regular bowel movements daily?

PATIENT P664
Uh just about.  Yeah for all practical purposes I'm very regular.

DOCTOR P664
Not any, has it been loose or constipation?

PATIENT P664
Uh that concerns me.  It was uh not loose at all and suddenly it became much softer.

PATIENT P664
Oh wait a minute, no I take half a pill for cholesterol every night but that's not it, that's not it no.  No that's.  You know I'm not taking this and uh I think it's my negligence.  

DOCTOR P664

DOCTOR P664
Let's see if there are any other ones that you're not taking.

PATIENT P664
Start it.

PATIENT P664
Yes.

DOCTOR P664
So you're not taking lisinopril either.

PATIENT P664
No.

DOCTOR P664
And you're not taking any blood pressure medicine?

PATIENT P664

DOCTOR P664
So DOCTOR, who saw you a couple of weeks ago.

PATIENT P664
No, well he.

DOCTOR P664
Told you to restart those medicines but you're not.

PATIENT P664
Now wait a minute DOCTOR?

DOCTOR P664

DOCTOR P664
Okay.

PATIENT P664
Which is not to say he didn't.

DOCTOR P664
Okay.

But I, you know, I need to okay uh.

DOCTOR P664
You're taking baby aspirin right?

PATIENT P664
Nope.

DOCTOR P664
Why not?

PATIENT P664
Uh, a combination of forgetfulness and negligence.  I have to take the blame for that because if I was @@@ to take it.

DOCTOR P664
Do you have the pills at home?

PATIENT P664
Yeah oh right.

DOCTOR P664
Do you have like the.

PATIENT P664

So I should be taking that stuff.  I'm seeing DOCTOR, cardiologist after this appointment.

DOCTOR P664
Uh-huh.  @@@.

PATIENT P664
Sure.

DOCTOR P664
And I think the reason why the plan @@@ for you to keep up on these medicines was to cut back on these medicines.

PATIENT P664
Uh.

DOCTOR P664
Was because during the time when you had the weight loss your blood pressure was low, you @@@.  It looks like things are @@@.

PATIENT P664
Yes.

DOCTOR P664
Okay.  Alright I need to just fill out; okay we have a series of questions the VA wants us to ask you guys okay?

PATIENT P664
Oh I'm at your disposal with great appreciation.

DOCTOR P664
Are you fairly active at home like walking around, do you do all the shopping yourself or?

You're eating like three meals a day?

PATIENT P664
Oh yes, very very good meals.

DOCTOR P664

PATIENT P664
Okay I have stiffness you know.  I'm an architect and I do a lot of sedentary work.

DOCTOR P664
Do you still do a lot of the architect stuff?

PATIENT P664
Not enough.  As a matter of fact I'm looking for work because I was off and uh during these travails.

DOCTOR P664
Hmm.

PATIENT P664
Uh but I still am rather sedentary and I get up and my back is stiff.  But that's being 79 I presume.

DOCTOR P664
I think you're doing pretty well as far as we're concerned.

PATIENT P664
Hmm.

DOCTOR P664
Take a deep breath, out.  Can you sit up for me?  Have a seat right here.

PATIENT P664
Okay.  I do this with some hesitation but I uh.

DOCTOR P664

DOCTOR P664
You've never smoked right?

No, it's very much under control and I hope therapeutic.

DOCTOR P664
Okay.

PATIENT P664
But I'd like to leave you with a notice of what I'm doing.

DOCTOR P664
Yeah, I wonder why…

PATIENT P664
Because I've been in here so regularly for the specialty things.

DOCTOR P664
Probably.

PATIENT P664
You know and I have my vitals you know whatever.  Although I really appreciate uh seeing a GP.

DOCTOR P664
Finally right?

PATIENT P664
Yes, yes.  Well I'm forever grateful to DOCTOR because she kept telling me to get a colonoscopy and I kept.

DOCTOR P664
And you didn’t want to?

PATIENT P664
And I had one and it was one of the worst experience, physical experiences I've ever had.  It was, you know, it was not good or you know uh and I don't like the procedure but because of her I had it done and it turned out I had a small tumor.  Um oh when to see you uh.

DOCTOR P664
Six months, three months?

DOCTOR P664
Maybe not.

PATIENT P664

PATIENT P664
Okay, yeah considering what I pay for it, I shouldn't uh skimp.  Alright.

DOCTOR P664

DOCTOR P664
I'm gonna refill your cholesterol medicine okay.

PATIENT P664
Uh, I have about three or four months.

DOCTOR P664
I'm just going to renew it.  You have no more refills left.

PATIENT P664
Oh, oh I see yeah because I should be taking it right.

DOCTOR P664
Let me finish my notes here.

PATIENT P664
Pardon?

DOCTOR P664
Let me finish my notes here.

PATIENT P664
Oh sure.

DOCTOR P664
Oh the ear wax.

PATIENT P664

DOCTOR P664
It's like an ear drop.

PATIENT P664
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P664
Let me see how often you should be using it.  So you do it twice a day.

PATIENT P664
Okay.

DOCTOR P664
3-5 drops twice a day for about four days okay.

PATIENT P664
Uh I can't tell you how much I appreciate that and my wife will appreciate it even more if I hear better.

DOCTOR P664
Oh really.  Alright so we'll give you 10 of that.  You can pick that up downstairs too.

PATIENT P664
Oh boy.  So three things.

DOCTOR P664
Yes.  So are we clear on everything?

PATIENT P664
I think so.

DOCTOR P664
So you're to pick up your two medicines, your three medicines.

PATIENT P664
Yes.

DOCTOR P664
Two for your blood pressure.

PATIENT P664
Uh-huh and the ear wax.

DOCTOR P664
And the one for the ear wax.

PATIENT P664
Yeah.

DOCTOR P664
And we'll do your cholesterol check when you come back.

PATIENT P664
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P664
When you go to Podiatry.

PATIENT P664
Podiatry, I'll stop at the blood lab.

DOCTOR P664
Any questions for me at all?

PATIENT P664
Yes uh, every month.

DOCTOR P664
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P664
Or more often I have a Port-A-Cath flushed.

DOCTOR P664
Okay.

PATIENT P664
Up on 9 East.

DOCTOR P664
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P664
Would it be simpler to have the cholesterol check as part of that or be more complicated?

DOCTOR P664
You could do it during that time but the thing is I'm not sure if they'll have the labels printed out to their labs.

PATIENT P664
Oh you want to do it.

DOCTOR P664
It doesn't matter as long as it's drawn.  So what we could do is.

PATIENT P664
Cause I'll be glad to do it when I come in for my podiatry.

DOCTOR P664
Well you could do it when you get the Port-A-Cath done.

PATIENT P664
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P664
When you get it flushed, ask them whether they can do your labs.

PATIENT P664
Okay for cholesterol.

DOCTOR P664
For your cholesterol.

PATIENT P664
Yes.

DOCTOR P664
If they cannot then you'll have to go see downstairs.  The main reason is I'm not sure where those labels print out from.

PATIENT P664
Uh-huh no.

DOCTOR P664
Should the labels.

PATIENT P664
Well I don't want to complicate things.

DOCTOR P664
If they don't print out, just ask them.

PATIENT P664
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR P664
If they don't have the labels then you get it done downstairs.

PATIENT P664
Okay.

DOCTOR P664
Or if they can regenerate the label then it's perfectly fine.

PATIENT P664
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P664
As long as the lab is done there.

PATIENT P664
Okay.

DOCTOR P664
Okay.

PATIENT P664
Yeah.

DOCTOR P664
So take your amlodipine, take your lisinopril.

PATIENT P664
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR P664
The cholesterol medicine and that's it and a baby aspirin.

PATIENT P664
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P664
Debrox.

PATIENT P664
Oh yes.
