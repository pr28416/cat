Um and all your EKGs are normal.

PATIENT Y079
Right.

DOCTOR Y079
So it doesn't sound like it's your heart.

PATIENT Y079
Yeah it seemed like, I don't know if it's like a muscle part or I was wondering maybe you know they had seen some type of tissues that was in my lungs you know now that's something do I have cancer, is that causing the pain, do I have a tumor?  You know so I'm just wondering what you call it because it just keeps bugging me.  You know they gave me blood cultures and.

DOCTOR Y079
Sounds like it’s a muscle, you know a pulled muscle.

PATIENT Y079
You know, but it's been like this going on year.  But of course I came in pain recently, you know before I came in - my left arm, you know just like I told you it gets numb, like needles and pins.

PATIENT Y079
That’s every day.

DOCTOR Y079
Like right now?

PATIENT Y079
Huh?  Right now it's not bothering; I just threw it across, see if maybe uh I move my arm you know too much and the wrong angle, because I had surgery back in 2006.

DOCTOR Y079
Oh.

PATIENT Y079
On this arm.

DOCTOR Y079
So if you had it @@@ I bet it's a little bit of the nerve that's irritated.

PATIENT Y079
Yeah because you know @@@ when I came in when I had the surgery on this, right I had lost all function of this arm.

DOCTOR Y079
Hmm, this is post-surgical.

PATIENT Y079
Alright, now this is bothering.  Kind of like @@@.

DOCTOR Y079
Yeah.

PATIENT Y079
Sometimes it's like needles and pins all up and down my arm because it's @@@.  @@@ any pain, @@@ you know like what I used to do with the type of work I was doing then you know I was trying to @@@.  So the only thing I connect it to you know was maybe the surgery you know, cause uh after surgery I had a lot of occupational therapy.

DOCTOR Y079
@@@.  Yeah.

PATIENT Y079
You know rebuild my muscle up cause I had to hold my arm up when I came here before the surgery and like the doctor said, you know, gave me those tests and then they did a probe you know they took blood, they @@@, biopsies, five needle prong, @@@.

DOCTOR Y079

DOCTOR Y079
Any fevers or chills or big lumps or bumps anywhere?

DOCTOR Y079
Okay, gotcha, gotcha.

PATIENT Y079
Yeah.

DOCTOR Y079
Um.

PATIENT Y079
So I was required, so I was asking them about you know the tumor cause they seen a growth and they checked it before and said it was benign then I was wondering could I have cancer which would have affected me.

DOCTOR Y079
Your chest x-ray in December was completely normal.

DOCTOR Y079
And your smoking will continue to make it worse.

PATIENT Y079
Uh-huh.  Okay I'm glad you told me that.

DOCTOR Y079
I mean that's what's going on here yeah.

PATIENT Y079
Cause I been thinking @@@.

DOCTOR Y079
Have you been @@@ substances?

PATIENT Y079
Yeah that's what kind of led me to surgery back in 2006 because I had the episode, you know I was doing rehab construction and so like one time we had to remove you know like we cleaned some stuff from this building so we used some caustic chemicals and I had to put on you know a protective suit and the doctor was saying DOCTOR said maybe you know it had seeped through and affected my renal system cause I had this tumor that popped up you know on my left arm, I couldn't use it.

DOCTOR Y079
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y079
I broke out in a rash.  For two days I couldn't see my eyes swole shut you know.  So when I came in to see them because it happened the same time I was seeing my regular physician which was DOCTOR then.  You know he rushed me to the Emergency Room and that's when I thought this is why my system is breaking down.

I need to do that for sure.  Especially since you alerted me to the fibrosis part and all the pain from this side.

DOCTOR Y079
Oh.

PATIENT Y079
I'm still thinking about because they had you know @@@ give me x-rays back in 2006 where they wanted to do exploratory surgery but the lady that was in charge of me then said no he just came out of surgery that's benign, blah, blah and I was dealing with the kid saying okay we got Hepatis C, we have to deal with this.
