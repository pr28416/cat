DOCTOR H135

PATIENT H135
Yes I know.  I haven't seen any Hines passes but I saw a lot of.

DOCTOR H135

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Um any family history of any medical problems as far as you know?

DOCTOR H135
Do you ever check your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT H135
No I don't.  I don't have the equipment for that.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
But I imagine if I talk real nice to somebody at the hospital I'd be able to.

DOCTOR H135
Well we can get you one here too um, that's always, down in the Prosthetic Lab they have blood pressure cuffs and we can get you.  Your blood pressure is a little bit high today so I was just wondering if you uh if you normally run high or if it's usually pretty good?

PATIENT H135
Well number one I'm stressful today.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
Um I was late getting here.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
You know I lost my way getting here uh, it started raining and then you know I didn't know where I was going.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
Uh usually I'm in control of.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  Well we'll recheck it; maybe it was just the pressure at that moment.  Um, I'll recheck it at the end of the visit.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy done?

PATIENT H135
No.

DOCTOR H135
No.  Who was the last primary doctor you saw?

PATIENT H135
Um DOCTOR.

DOCTOR H135
Where was he @@@.

PATIENT H135
DuPage Medical Group.  I don't know if the name is on there or not.  He replaced DOCTOR.

DOCTOR H135
Oh.

PATIENT H135
I don't have, I might have a card that's up-to-date.

DOCTOR H135
That's okay, actually one of the doctors here, her husband is in this group.  Her name is DOCTOR.  I don't know her husband's name to be honest.  I don't, it might be DOCTOR I'm not sure but I don't see it on there.

PATIENT H135
Well there are so many different areas.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah there is.

PATIENT H135
That.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah.  Um.  As far as vaccinations, do you have the tetanus shot, pneumonia shot, @@@.

PATIENT H135
Uh I'm good with everything.  I had a swine flu.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
Okay.  The only thing that I'm lacking is the flu shot and he was kind of concerned about um.

DOCTOR H135
You had the pneumonia vaccine and you're current with tetanus?

PATIENT H135
Yes.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  When did you have the pneumonia vaccine, do you remember?

PATIENT H135
It was about two or three years ago.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  And when was your tetanus, can you remember?

PATIENT H135
About the same.  The only thing I haven't got is the shingles and uh, everything's current.  I even have a TB shot, they vaccinated me for TB.

DOCTOR H135
Uh well when was that?

PATIENT H135
Uh October 20th of last year.

DOCTOR H135
Is a vaccine or give you the PPD?

PATIENT H135
They just gave it to me in the arm; they tested me in the arm.

DOCTOR H135
And they had you go back and they looked at it?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Okay that wasn't a vaccination.

PATIENT H135
Oh alright oh.

DOCTOR H135
Just so you know.

PATIENT H135
No.

DOCTOR H135
So um that is what they do is they inject, they basically boil down tuberculosis and kill it and then they inject the particles under your skin to see if your body reacts to it.

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Um if it reacts to it then they think that maybe you had it in the past.  The reason I tell you that is that there is a TB vaccine which is almost never used anymore except for in Europe.  Um, it's called BCG vaccine.  They use it over in Europe a lot but it's not used much in America but it can give you a false positive for your TB so, it's a good idea to know if you've ever had that cause they'll put a PPD on you and it'll be positive and then you'll get treatment for TB.

PATIENT H135
No they did.  I had to go back and they.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah @@@ fine.

PATIENT H135
Yeah.  That's how I got the job; I had to pass that to get working in the hospital.

DOCTOR H135
Oh so yeah that makes sense, that makes sense.

PATIENT H135
So.  I mean you know.  But the only thing I haven't got is the flu shot and the shingles.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  Um do you want to get the shingles?  We can get that for you today.

PATIENT H135
Alright, @@@ to do this.

DOCTOR H135
I think it's a good idea, especially working in the hospital @@@.  The shingles is basically the reactivation of chicken pox.  Have you ever had chicken pox before?

PATIENT H135
I might have, I don't know.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  Uh as far as the flu shot we don't have the seasonal flu shot anymore.  That's kind of.

PATIENT H135
I had the swine flu is what I had.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
I had the opportunity to get that and I did.

DOCTOR H135
So that's good um, uh so you still need the seasonal flu shot every year.

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  Uh.

PATIENT H135
Well when you're working, I can do different things but when I'm not working it's pretty hard I mean you know.  As far as insurance wise you know.

DOCTOR H135
Oh sure, yeah sure.  Um have you ever smoked?

PATIENT H135
Yes I have.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  Have you ever had an ultrasound of the abdomen done to look for aneurysms or anything?

PATIENT H135
No.

DOCTOR H135
Um we generally recommend at the age of 65.  There is some evidence showing that anyone who smoked as many as 10 packs of cigarettes in their entire life um are at an increased risk for an aneurysm in the aorta.  So at the age 65, for anyone that's ever smoked, we recommend a one-time ultrasound just to take a look to see if there are any aneurysm.  If it looks fine then everything's fine you know.  If it is a problem then you know, whatever intervention is necessary is taken.  Um, its pain free, it's quick, takes a couple of minutes.  I think it's a good idea, that's what I tell most of my patients.

PATIENT H135
Well if my shot records up I'm not running scared.

DOCTOR H135
Okay. 

PATIENT H135
Okay.

DOCTOR H135
Good.  Now as far as the colonoscopy, so you've never had done um, starting at the age of 50 we recommend uh you know starting screening for colorectal cancer um.  Would you be opposed to just seeing our GI doctor about getting a colonoscopy?

PATIENT H135
Not right away.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
Let's put that on the back burner.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
I have issues with that, but anyway.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  I will say you know what you're not the first person I've had issues with.  First when I talked my dad into doing it just a couple years ago, cause he turned 50 like two years ago and um he said the worst part was the prep the night before.  The actual procedure doesn't hurt at all; you're pretty much asleep for the whole thing.  The night before they make you drink a bunch of stuff to clean your bowels out and.

PATIENT H135
That I could turn my head quick, that'll do the same, no I'm.

DOCTOR H135
But it's I think, most people who have it done uh in the end say it was much ado about nothing, @@@.  Just a reassurance.

PATIENT H135
Next time I come in I might ask for it.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
You understand, that's the way I am.

DOCTOR H135
Sure.

PATIENT H135
Okay.  Um I have some.

DOCTOR H135
Double check your labs just to see.  So yeah it looks like everything here hasn't been done that we would use.  Can I have this copy or do you need it back?

PATIENT H135
You can do anything you want sir.

DOCTOR H135
Okay so I'm going to put this in our computer.  It looks like these are all current so we don't need to get any lab work on you today.  This was done a month ago, most of the stuff so.  Okay can you sit up here, I want to take a quick listen to you and I want to check your blood pressure.

PATIENT H135
Okay.  I have some prescriptions of my uh metformin and glipizide and it also has his name and address and phone on there.

DOCTOR H135
Whose name is it?

PATIENT H135
The doctor, DOCTOR.

DOCTOR H135
Oh yeah.

PATIENT H135
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR H135
We can get that for you, it's not a problem.  Um the only thing I would say is how much do you pay for it now?

PATIENT H135
What I done is I was paying just about $33 at Walgreens and I went to, one day I went to Walmart and checked a three months’ supply.

DOCTOR H135
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H135
For $20.

DOCTOR H135
$20 okay.  So I think the VA medications we can get you are $8 a month, I don't know how much for a three month supply but I know some of these medications, like metformin I think, I was just hearing something about, was it Walmart or Target is now offering metformin for free um.  It's a new promotion they're running.  I don't know if it's going to be forever or if it's just kind of a new thing they're doing.

PATIENT H135
Well alright, I have a three months’ supply for $20 so, that's almost $4 a prescription.

DOCTOR H135
Three months’ supply of both for $20?

PATIENT H135
I have 90 days.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah.

PATIENT H135
Of glipizide.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah.

PATIENT H135
And 180 of metformin.

DOCTOR H135
And that's $20 total for both medications?

PATIENT H135
Total.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah that's going to be cheaper than you're going to get it here I'm pretty sure.

PATIENT H135
Okay.

DOCTOR H135
Um I could put it in the computer and I have no problem letting you get your medication from here, from a cost perspective you'd probably save a couple of bucks getting it from Walmart um.  But that's up to you.

PATIENT H135
But uh, I need a new meter too so what's.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah we'll get you that.

PATIENT H135
Okay.  It's, like I said I'm running illegal right now okay.

DOCTOR H135
Can you give me a couple of deep breaths please?  Can you lay back for me?  Any pain there?

PATIENT H135
Other than gas.

DOCTOR H135
Can you open your mouth and say ah?  Okay.  Did you have surgery on your nose?

PATIENT H135
Yes sir.

DOCTOR H135
What was that for?

PATIENT H135
I had a growth there and here, uh four years ago.

DOCTOR H135
You can sit up.

PATIENT H135
And I.

DOCTOR H135
Did they tell you, what was it?

PATIENT H135
It was uh cancerous.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  Take a deep breath for me.

PATIENT H135
That's fine.  It was cancerous but uh.

DOCTOR H135
They got all of it?

PATIENT H135
Yes sir.  I went back for a mole surgery, there was one little spot that came up about right in here, they took that out and I had that a couple years ago.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
That they finally took the second one out.

DOCTOR H135
Do remember what kind of cancer, squamous cell, basal cell, do you remember?

PATIENT H135
Basal cell.

DOCTOR H135
Basal okay.  Any swelling in the feet ever?

PATIENT H135
No.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  Do you mind taking your shoes off for me?

PATIENT H135
Alright.

DOCTOR H135
I'm sure that you know with diabetes you get the increased risk of foot ulcers.  So we'll take a quick look at your feet to make sure they look okay.  Um do you have an eye doctor?

PATIENT H135
I haven't had my eyes checked in a couple of years.

DOCTOR H135
Okay do you want us to do that for you?

PATIENT H135
Yes sir.

DOCTOR H135
With diabetes you should be checking your eyes uh.

PATIENT H135
I know that I should get them checked.  You want both shoes off?

DOCTOR H135
Yes.

PATIENT H135
Okay.  Now is the insurance going to pay this or?

DOCTOR H135
I'll be honest I don't know anything about how insurance works here.  Um, I just don't do any of that, that side of it.  If you ask up front at the desk they may have a little more information about how insurance works here.

PATIENT H135
Cause I don't wallets, it's my first time here I have no idea.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah I know, to be honest with you.

PATIENT H135
I don't even know how good my insurance is.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
Alright.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah how the VA does billing, we don't do any of that.  I mean from the medical side.  You know the doctors don't do any of that.

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
So I don't know how that works uh.  Up front they'll either be able to tell you how it works or they can send you to the office that can tell you how that stuff works.

PATIENT H135
Okay.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  Do you have any problems with your eyes?

PATIENT H135
Well I use bifocals.  Oh I have no problems seeing at night, you know.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah okay.  But no problems from the diabetes as far as you know?

PATIENT H135
As far as I know no.

DOCTOR H135
Have you ever taken an aspirin?

PATIENT H135
Taken an aspirin?

DOCTOR H135
Uh like a daily aspirin?

PATIENT H135
No.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
I do take aspirins when I have a headache.

DOCTOR H135
Well aspirin um, there's a lot of studies on aspirin and heart disease.  Uh mostly aspirin is really not a great pain medication.  Um stuff like Advil, Tylenol are better but what aspirin does that's nice from a medical standpoint is that it attaches to the platelets and makes platelets from not be able aggregate as much so it makes the blood not clot as much um so that reduces the risk of strokes, heart attacks, all that kind of stuff in people who are at risk.  Uh in a lot of our diabetic patients we recommend a baby aspirin a day, just 81 mg.  When you take aspirin for like pain its 650 mg but a small dose of aspirin, 81 mg a day, uh has been shown to reduce the risk of uh heart attacks, coronary events.

PATIENT H135
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H135
Uh just because that has a platelet property.  Uh it's absolutely indicated for everyone who's had heart attacks or heart disease in the past but there's a lot of evidence saying that it's probably beneficial in patients who have a lot of risk factors like diabetes.

PATIENT H135
Just a regular baby aspirin right?

DOCTOR H135
Regular baby aspirin a day yeah.  So I'd probably recommend that to you, it's a loose recommendation but um, probably help you more than it would hurt you.  They look good.  Have you ever had any cuts, bruises, hard time healing?

PATIENT H135
No not really.

DOCTOR H135
No okay.

PATIENT H135
Other than when I whack myself on a bumper or something you know.  But that's usually not long.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  But no problems with healing down there?

PATIENT H135
No.

DOCTOR H135
Diabetes can cause a problem with the blood vessels in your legs.  Uh it can cause circulation.

PATIENT H135
Yeah, here's another thing too, I'm also 69 years old.  I can't compete you know.

DOCTOR H135
Sure.  Okay can you close your eyes for me?  Do you feel this?

PATIENT H135
I feel you pressing on it.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah excellent.  Do you feel that?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Do you feel that there?

PATIENT H135
No.

DOCTOR H135
Feel that?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Okay, do you feel this?

PATIENT H135
Well I feel that.

DOCTOR H135
You feel that?

PATIENT H135
Yeah, no.

DOCTOR H135
Do you feel that?

PATIENT H135
Yeah I feel that.

DOCTOR H135
How about here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  I tested you just to check the nerves in the foot.  Diabetes can cause problems with the nerves in the foot but we.  Can you feel that?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Feel that?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Feel that?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Feel that?

PATIENT H135
Again.  Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
How about over here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Over here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Okay, same thing, feel that here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
How about here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135

PATIENT H135
No.  There yeah, other toe.

DOCTOR H135
Here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Right here?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.  That's good.  

PATIENT H135
I was getting a false reading from you touching my hand.

DOCTOR H135
Oh yeah.  Just a little test we do to make sure that uh the nerves in the foot are @@@.  I'll check your blood pressure too.

PATIENT H135
Do you want me to take this off?

DOCTOR H135
Uh you can pull it up, it's kind of easier.

PATIENT H135
I asked the nurse that and she said we’ll do whatever.

DOCTOR H135
Let me check your arm there thanks.  Let me just write this down.  You know @@@ it's the only one I could find in the clinic.  Let's try it again.  It's a little bit too big but @@@.  It's a lot better.  124/64.  Were you a little worked up when I first took it?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
I looked around the room @@@ couldn’t find the building.  Okay, first day visit and late, that's not a good.

DOCTOR H135
I'm never on time.

PATIENT H135
Well I'm on old man time, if I’m not here an hour early I'm late.  Should I put my shoes back on?

DOCTOR H135
Oh yeah.  Singles vaccine @@@ back order, yeah.  I know they keep it in stock at Loyola but I think here, if I remember right, it's frozen or cooled or something like that and they have to thaw it out and send it back out um.  I can't even find it, where is it.  I need to figure out what's going on @@@.  I'll be right back okay.  

PATIENT H135
Alright.

DOCTOR H135
I'll be with you in a second.

PATIENT H135
No that's okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  70:13  DOCTOR IN:  

DOCTOR H135
Okay, I figured it up.  I don't work back in this clinic all that often so, you know once every two weeks generally so you kind of have to relearn everything you come here.

PATIENT H135
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR H135
But you do have to schedule another appointment.  They don't do it in the clinic um.  So they want me to tell you, @@@.  The only medication that seems to pop up with, herpes vaccine was a randomized controlled trial involving 38,000 patients; the vaccine was shown to reduce the incidence of shingles by 51.3% and the incidence of post herpetic neuralgia which is the chronic pain you get from shingles by almost 2/3.  So it's pretty good data for it.

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Um.  

PATIENT H135
I got to find out if they're going to pay for this or not you know.  

DOCTOR H135
The shingles vaccine?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Um if there's a problem with it, I know you can get the shingles vaccine at any Dominick or Walgreens and it's pretty cheap.  I know it's actually, my patients at Loyola, I don't know how much it is at Loyola and I don't know how much it is at Dominick, but I know it's significantly cheaper, but I don't even give it to people at Loyola I just tell them to go to Dominick or Walgreens um but, you can ask them when you sign out uh how much it is and what the insurance benefits are or they can give you someone to call to know and they should be able to tell you.  Uh.

PATIENT H135
I'll definitely ask that.

DOCTOR H135
I put those medications in for you.  Um the only thing that I did notice, it wouldn't cause me to change anything on you today um but someone who's a diabetic, our goals for LDL and HDL here generally above 40 and below 70.  Okay HDL is good cholesterol and LDL is the bad cholesterol.  You want your good cholesterol high and your bad cholesterol low.  For diabetics there's a lot of evidence that shows uh you get good cardiac risk prevention if your HDL is greater than 40 or your LDL is less than 70.  So we want to get this number down and this number up.  Best way to do that is through diet and exercise.  Um diet stuff, cholesterol you want to stay away from and I don't know if you've heard this before but stay away from saturated fats and trans fats.  Those are what kills you for cholesterol.  Uh trans fats, anything you read where the package says partially hydrogenated vegetable oils um a lot of your like processed foods, processed cheeses, uh processed peanut butter have partially hydrogenated vegetable oils or trans fats.  Those are bad for making the LDL high.  Best thing to get the LDL low and the HDL high is uh not avoiding fats actually it's just how.

PATIENT H135
Moderation is.

DOCTOR H135
Well what kind of fats.  So you want to go after the unsaturated fats.  Unsaturated fats are actually good for you.  The thinking used to be stay away from fats at all costs, don't ever eat any fats. That's kind of changed a little bit.  I mean obviously you don't want to do too much fats because they still have a lot of calories um but in terms of the heart stuff and your cholesterol uh good fats like olive oil, the vegetable oils, actually help, they make your cholesterol profile better.

PATIENT H135
Uh I cook my breakfast with olive oil.

DOCTOR H135
Good.

PATIENT H135
Extra virgin olive oil.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah good.

PATIENT H135
And um my breakfast is about a half a cup of onion, half a cup of mushrooms and egg beater.

DOCTOR H135
Okay, yeah that's good.

PATIENT H135
With uh.

DOCTOR H135
The other thing that's good, is I don't know what you eat for dinner and stuff like that, but fish is excellent.

PATIENT H135
I love fish.

DOCTOR H135
You love fish?

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
Good.  Eat as much fish as you can.  Better than, it's @@@ than red meat.  I mean I'm not going to tell you, I love steak as much as the next person, I'm not going to tell you I never eat steak but.

PATIENT H135
Red meat I have maybe once every two weeks and we're talking about 4-5 ounces max.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
Okay.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah.

PATIENT H135
Um I eat a lot of chicken, pork, fish.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah.  Chicken, pork are better than red meat.  Fish in terms of this is better than all of them because it has those Omega 3 fatty acids are unsaturated fats so they help out a lot.  The other thing is exercise and I know you said you walk 5-6 miles a night and that's great but exercise as much as you can um.  We can watch this for now.  If it doesn't go down a little bit we can always maybe try starting you on like fish oil tablets or something like that or there are statins which is a cholesterol medication which a lot of people use and get pretty good results with.

PATIENT H135
Yeah

DOCTOR H135
But if we can keep you off of the medication for now we'll try that.

PATIENT H135
Yeah medication is fine but let's try the pushing away from the table on some of this garbage.

DOCTOR H135
Sure, let's try that okay.  The hemoglobin A1c looks great.  Uh the PSA looks great. Uh everything else looks fine okay.  I don't see anything else that's worrisome.  Um so when you check out today uh, um.

PATIENT H135
Here's where he hollered about my potassium.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah it's a little high here, I noticed that.  I can't explain that but it looks fine um.

PATIENT H135
Well I put the kibosh on it.

DOCTOR H135
On what?

PATIENT H135
I was eating a lot of vegetables okay.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah.  It's hard to tell what that's from.  It's one isolated.  Potassium isn't like cholesterol where it's kind of a thing that you know um, in the absence of kidney failure, it's hard to say what that was from.  Whether you maybe had a glass of orange juice before you came in or a banana or something like that.

PATIENT H135
Bananas maybe yeah.

DOCTOR H135
But um, you know this isn't that worrisome I mean.  The normal level here is 5.2, at the VA its 5.4, so that would still be considered; it's very close to normal.  Um if this was consistently high or if it was going up I'd be a little bit more worried about it um.  I don't think that this lab value is enough cause for concern that you should stop eating vegetables.

PATIENT H135
No I didn't say I would stop, I cut back.

DOCTOR H135
You cut back.

PATIENT H135
I'm a firm believer if I'm hungry I open the icebox and there's a small dish of green beans.

DOCTOR H135
Well.

PATIENT H135
That would be it rather than.

DOCTOR H135
I mean moderation is always what we preach here uh but I'd rather have you eating green beans than eating a pizza or something you know.  You know that's kind of a fine line we walk you know if you're hungry if you're going to, you know crack open some carrots and celery or some green beans, it's a lot better than some of the things you could be doing.

PATIENT H135
Uh pizza is not one of them.

DOCTOR H135
Well good.  You'd be surprised how many people don't think the way you think.

PATIENT H135
Well, like I said I'm more concerned with my eyesight and my legs.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah.

PATIENT H135
Okay.

DOCTOR H135
Yeah.

PATIENT H135
Cause without wheels you're not going no place.

DOCTOR H135
Well right, yeah and we want to keep those.

PATIENT H135
Yeah.

DOCTOR H135
You know so.  So most of my diabetic patients at least initially I like to see every three months and if we get everything stabilized and you know probably change it out to six months.  Is that okay with you?

PATIENT H135
@@@.

DOCTOR H135
Okay.

PATIENT H135
Am I going to be seeing you or?

DOCTOR H135
You'll be seeing me okay.  You'll be seeing me.

PATIENT H135
Alright that'd be good.
DOCTOR H135
Okay.  Okay any questions?

PATIENT H135
No.

DOCTOR H135
It was nice meeting you.  When you check out ask them about the uh, the shingles vaccine okay.  Cause they have to get you a separate appointment for that.

PATIENT H135
Okay.  

DOCTOR H135
It's not an appointment with me, it's a nurse appointment.  You have to actually have the shingles vaccine up.

PATIENT H135
And walk in and take care of it and go back home.

DOCTOR H135
Right, right.  Here you go sir.

PATIENT H135
Alright.

DOCTOR H135
Nice meeting you.

PATIENT H135
Nice meeting you sir.

DOCTOR H135
Take care okay.

PATIENT H135
Okay, I got the rest of my life to get home.

DOCTOR H135
Okay bye, bye.
