Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
And it's getting worse.

PATIENT D442
Yeah I would say a little worse yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.  More pain when walking?

PATIENT D442
It's more like when I sleep you know.

DOCTOR D442
Not as much when you're walking?

PATIENT D442
I can walk and yeah sometime if I walk a long way you know.

DOCTOR D442
Sleeping your leg cramp up?

PATIENT D442
Sometimes at night yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
That's pretty painful too.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.  It wakes you up?

PATIENT D442
Yeah you wake up and all of a sudden, so I'd like them to look at it.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.  You saw the Hem/Onc because right because you had that high white count?

PATIENT D442
Pardon me?

DOCTOR D442
The Hematology/Oncology people?

PATIENT D442
Yes.

DOCTOR D442
You saw them okay.  Your chest x-ray was normal.  Then did they say anything?  You saw them again in September.

PATIENT D442
Right.

DOCTOR D442
Okay let's see.

PATIENT D442
I saw DOCTOR.

DOCTOR D442
DOCTOR yeah.

PATIENT D442
DOCTOR yeah and she said I'll see her in six months.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
And she gave me a lot of blood work.

DOCTOR D442
To do.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
I don't know what the results were or anything but.

DOCTOR D442
I think one thing was negative they were looking for.  They think maybe because you smoke it could be why your white counts a little bit high.  It can happen with smoking.

PATIENT D442
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Um but you had a negative x-ray and everything like that so.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Um there's one more test where they check some kind of gene, that's still pending that they're gonna follow up with you once you.

PATIENT D442
Is that the one in your back?

DOCTOR D442
No its called BCR-ABL.  I'm sure it's not something that people usually hear of.  It's just a type of gene they test for it.

PATIENT D442
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D442
Yeah.  Okay.  And you saw the GU people, the Urology.  Has your prostate biopsy been scheduled on the 1st?

PATIENT D442
I didn't schedule nothing.  I told them I didn't want the test.

DOCTOR D442
Okay you don't want it.

PATIENT D442
And they sent me a enema thing and some pills and.

DOCTOR D442
You don't want to do it?

PATIENT D442
Not right now.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
He said well we're gonna bring you back in February.  I said okay let's see how it is then and then I go home and a week later I got a box with that stuff in it.  Kind of ticked me off cause they're forcing me you know.

DOCTOR D442
I mean I think you just have to tell them you don't want it.  I don't know if it was really clear that.

PATIENT D442
Yeah this guy didn't want no for an answer is what it was.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.  Okay.  Okay that's fine, whenever you're ready to do that, you just have to understand the risks of it if you don't get it done.

PATIENT D442
Right, right.

DOCTOR D442
So I think that's the only reason.  The risk is you know it could be prostate cancer and you're not catching it.

PATIENT D442
Right, right, I understand.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
Well what were my numbers?  Did she take?

DOCTOR D442
Um the most recent one you have is on August 10th and it was 6.79.

PATIENT D442
Alright.

DOCTOR D442
You've been high before so I'm not @@@.

PATIENT D442
Okay.

DOCTOR D442
So this is the highest.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
You're been is 6.79.

PATIENT D442
Okay.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
If you want us to follow it, we can follow it in clinic.  If at any point you feel like it's kind of high, there's no, I mean usually when it's this high they just do it cause there's no real way to tell until you take the biopsy you know.

PATIENT D442
Right.

DOCTOR D442
It could be high for no, any other reason.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
You know because your prostate's big.

PATIENT D442
Right now the next time I see you and uh.

DOCTOR D442
We can check it.

PATIENT D442
I.

DOCTOR D442
Were you, do you want us to check it?

PATIENT D442
Yeah, right, yeah.  When I can take a blood test before I come and see you?

DOCTOR D442
Yeah just remind me.

PATIENT D442
Okay.  That's cool.

DOCTOR D442
We can do that.  You got the flu shot?

PATIENT D442
Uh yeah I just took it.

DOCTOR D442
Um what about your weight loss?  How's that going?

PATIENT D442
Uh always trying.

DOCTOR D442
Always trying.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Still eating out?

PATIENT D442
Yeah for the most part you know.

DOCTOR D442
About the same since I last, for the past month or so.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT D442
Better than gaining.  Yeah I'd like to lose some but it's hard at my age I don't know.  And then I heard the medicine I'm taking cause of diabetes it's harder, I don't know if that's true.

DOCTOR D442
Uh-huh.  Did you see the pharmacist at all?

PATIENT D442
Uh I think I did.

DOCTOR D442
The clinical pharmacy… do you know.  I think you, oh there we go, you saw the pharmacist.  Have you seen the eye doctors?  When did you last see them?  Did you see them this year already?  The eye doctors?

PATIENT D442
I believe so.  I usually go every six months.

DOCTOR D442
Uh you saw them in July last year.

PATIENT D442
Okay so I'm due huh.

DOCTOR D442
You're due.

PATIENT D442
Okay.

DOCTOR D442
So we'll have you just follow up with them.

PATIENT D442
Right.

DOCTOR D442
And you're taking the 60 units twice a day for your diabetes?

PATIENT D442
No I just take one shot.

DOCTOR D442
Oh in 120.

PATIENT D442
One yes, yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Try splitting it.  That's what I think she wanted you to do.

PATIENT D442
Right she mentioned something about it.

DOCTOR D442
Yeah.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Just split it okay.

PATIENT D442
Yeah it's just hard sticking you twice a day, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR D442
Uh-huh.  And then.

PATIENT D442
She said it would work better.

DOCTOR D442
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D442
Because instead of jamming it all at once you know.  I guess I should so.

DOCTOR D442
The A1c was high I remember the last time we saw you.  And you're still on the metformin 1 gram twice a day?  How much of the metformin do you take again?

PATIENT D442
Take four pills a day.

DOCTOR D442
Four pills a day okay.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.  Did you put that in already?

DOCTOR D442
Yeah I'll put it in, I'll remember.  Uh we need to get your A1c again and you need to see @@@ and then we'll have you see me, let's see.  When was the last time you saw your blood doctors, has it been a while?  I might have to put a new consult in.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT D442
Right now you'll put it in and then they'll call me or just send me a letter?

DOCTOR D442

DOCTOR OUT:  30:29  DOCTOR IN:  42:51

SECOND DOCTOR D442
@@@ hey.  I'm DOCTOR I'll @@@.

PATIENT D442
Hi.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
I wanted to get a better sense of what's going on with you, what the symptoms are on your legs so if you can tell me in your own words.

PATIENT D442
They uh sometimes feel like they're asleep I guess would be the best.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
Best way to describe what happens you know.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Like a numbness, tingling type of pain?

PATIENT D442
Yeah and then I get up and I walk and it's alright then you now.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
But I uh I've had this for years and I know when they don't feel right and I feel at this time they don't feel right.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
You're not feeling right.  Okay.

PATIENT D442
Right so.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
So you had a diagnosis that this is related to your diabetes, a neuropathy?  Have you ever heard of that before?

PATIENT D442
Isn't that with your feet?

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Yeah.  Like the numbness, tingling or pain.

PATIENT D442
I have uh nerve damage in my feet.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Okay.  Is this what it feels; is it how your symptoms have been feeling in the past?

PATIENT D442
Uh, oh my feet are bad to begin with and uh but my legs they just seem to be uh not as good as before and they usually go in, you know with uh, I forgot what they call it.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Angiogram.

PATIENT D442
Yeah right, instead of going to your heart they go into your legs.  I've had that done uh two, maybe three times.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
Because I've had blood clots in my, where they put stents in.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Oh you have stents okay.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
How far can you walk without having to stop from cramps?

PATIENT D442
I probably can go uh a good block.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
Maybe more you know.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Has that been stable cause it looked like in 2010 you were able to go about a block?

PATIENT D442
I, you know my walking hasn't changed that much.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Okay.  Okay but just when you go to bed you notice more of a falling asleep sensation.

PATIENT D442
Right, right.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Okay.  Can you take off your shoes and socks, let me take a look.  So that's a pretty invasive test that angiogram @@@.  I want to make sure that that's what we think is going on.

PATIENT D442
Well they don't, they go in, you know here.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Yeah, yeah.  No, no, I know.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.  My toes are bad so.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Your toes are bad?  Okay.

PATIENT D442
I mean my nails because I'm going Monday.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Oh okay, let's take a look.  Now you feel all throughout here, your whole leg?

PATIENT D442
No it's just from right here down.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Just from here down.  Now do your fingers have any of this sensation?

PATIENT D442
No.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Okay.  Can you feel it when I touch you?

PATIENT D442
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Close your eyes, tell me when you feel something.

PATIENT D442
Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
You have great pulses.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
Pulses.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
But the micro stick, your toes are nice and warm which is a good sign.
PATIENT D442
Good.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
That they're getting good blood flow.

PATIENT D442
Okay, right.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
So.  So the question is is this nerve or is this a blood flow problem or is this a nerve problem because diabetes can also cause the nerves to get that numbness, tingling.

PATIENT D442
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Nerve sensation.  Um we can do a test called an EMG which can help us with that and we can also check the ABIs to see if they've gotten worse and that gabapentin, do you remember that gabapentin medication that you take three times a day?  That was probably started for neuropathy.

PATIENT D442
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Do you want to go up on that dose; see if that helps a little bit with your symptoms?

PATIENT D442
Sure if you think it'll help.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
We'll try it.  We'll kind of try it um cause if it was blood.  If it was a blood flow problem and it's happening at rest I think what I would expect is when you start walking it would get much worse.  Which doesn't sound like the case.  It seems like you're still being able to walk about a block or whatever is your baseline.

PATIENT D442
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
So um I'm wondering if this is a different process than a blood flow problem, it may be a nerve problem.  But we also want to check the muscle @@@.  Okay so the plan is to go up on gabapentin, check A1c, check ABIs and CBC.  Sound like a plan?  You don't understand anything I said.  All the letters.  So we're gonna check the nerves, blood flow and muscles. 

PATIENT D442
Some tests or something?

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Yes.

PATIENT D442
What kind of tests?

SECOND DOCTOR D442
The ABIs are the blood pressure where they check the pressure of the blood vessel. 

PATIENT D442
I've had that done yes okay.  Where they put blood pressure cuffs on you?

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Yeah.

PATIENT D442
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
To see if that's compromised and then one is a blood test and the EMG is they test the nerve conduction in your legs.

PATIENT D442
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Alright.

PATIENT D442
Before I'm gonna go see that other guy right?

SECOND DOCTOR D442
I think so.

PATIENT D442
Okay.

DOCTOR D442
I think that it's leaning towards something else other than vascular.

PATIENT D442
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Vascular meaning blood vessel disease.

PATIENT D442
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Cause the activity seems to be stable but something is going on at rest.

PATIENT D442
Right.  Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
So you don't get those cramps like um charley horse cramps.

PATIENT D442
Sometimes.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Sometimes.

PATIENT D442
Yeah.

DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442
Very painful.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Okay.  You can check his electrolytes.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
Oh @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Okay, we have a plan in place alright.

PATIENT D442
Electrolytes.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Electrolytes.

PATIENT D442
Should I be drinking Gatorade?

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Well we're gonna check.  Probably not.  So most commonly it's not an abnormality.

PATIENT D442
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
But we'll make sure that’s not the problem.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
90 @@@ right for the gabapentin?

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D442
Can I put?

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Yeah.

PATIENT D442
Thank you.

SECOND DOCTOR D442
Sure.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
Can you get lab work done today?

PATIENT D442
Pardon me?

FIRST DOCTOR D442
Can you get the lab work done today?  Are you able to on your way out?

PATIENT D442
Sure.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
Okay.

PATIENT D442

FIRST DOCTOR D442
No it's not for the fasting.  That way I can call you on your way out.  Labs today okay.

PATIENT D442
Alright no problem.

FIRST DOCTOR D442

PATIENT D442

FIRST DOCTOR D442
I'll renew your medications, I will, I'll remember it and I'd like to put a few other things in for you okay.

PATIENT D442
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
And they'll schedule your Ophtho out there for your eyes okay, the Ophthalmology, the eye doctors.

PATIENT D442
Okay they'll schedule that for me now?

FIRST DOCTOR D442
Yeah cause it's September 4th and then increase your gabapentin, take an extra pill every eight hours.  You're taking two pills right, every eight.

PATIENT D442
Every eight, yeah I take six a day.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
Six a day yeah so you're being put on nine, take three every eight hours okay.

PATIENT D442
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
And I'll send you more in the mail so it'll be sent so you don't run out.

PATIENT D442
Alright, okay.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
And they'll schedule you for that muscle test and the blood pressure tests okay.  It's called an EMG and ABIs.

PATIENT D442
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
Alright.

PATIENT D442
They'll send me a letter then?

FIRST DOCTOR D442
They can try scheduling it now.

PATIENT D442
Oh okay.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
Yeah.  Okay. 

PATIENT D442
Alright I guess that's it.

FIRST DOCTOR D442
Alright, yep.  I'll put that in for you okay.
