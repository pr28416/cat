DOCTOR Q755
You were in good health and then all of a sudden this happened.

And I understand that they had to cut below your knee on this one and just your toes on this leg right.

PATIENT Q755
Right, right.

DOCTOR Q755

DOCTOR Q755
Were you out in the cold during the blizzard?

PATIENT Q755
I was cold; I was out in the cold.

DOCTOR Q755

PATIENT Q755
Oh no, no, no, no.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay.

PATIENT Q755
Hmm.

DOCTOR Q755
Alright, so according to the computer though you have a lot of medicines they want you to take.  Are you taking those?

PATIENT Q755
@@@, I take them right, right.

DOCTOR Q755
You do those.  Okay cause you have some blood pressure medicines so it looks like maybe you did have high blood pressure.

PATIENT Q755
Well I thought I did cause you know I knew it was kind of high, I knew if I'd feel dizzy when I'd be walking.

DOCTOR Q755
Oh.

PATIENT Q755
I'd feel a little dizzy but after a while, cause I quit what I was doing and it'd go away.

DOCTOR Q755
A pack about every day and a half okay, alright.  Um any other problems you're having besides with your legs.  Because with your legs I can't help you unfortunately.  You've got to get Podiatry to help you.

PATIENT Q755
Hmm.

DOCTOR Q755
Nothing, no problem, no problems with your medicines or anything?

PATIENT Q755
No problems, no medicines.

DOCTOR Q755
It looks like you're gonna run out of stuff soon.

PATIENT Q755
Yeah I ran out of one already.  I @@@.

DOCTOR Q755
You did alright.  Amlodipine.  Are you needing this diphenhydramine, that's the Benadryl?  I don't know, were you taking it for itching or for sleeping?

PATIENT Q755
No I don't take nothing like that.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay so you don't need that one I guess.

PATIENT Q755
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q755
Um.  They have you on iron supplements, was your iron low, do you know?

PATIENT Q755
Yeah I was gonna ask you if you know, but I'm taking two iron supplements.

DOCTOR Q755
Yeah.  Let me see how they were. 

PATIENT Q755
One of them I still have quite a few but the other one's kind of low.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay.

PATIENT Q755
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q755
Let me see what they put you on.  Maybe they want you to have it.

PATIENT Q755
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q755
Oh your hemoglobin is very low, that's your blood count, okay.  And when you take the iron are you having problems with constipation at all?

PATIENT Q755
No, not at all.

DOCTOR Q755
No okay.

PATIENT Q755
I don't take the @@@ any more.

DOCTOR Q755
The oh you don't take the stool softeners anymore?

PATIENT Q755
No, they make me keeping running.

DOCTOR Q755
Oh.  So even, but you are taking the iron.

PATIENT Q755
I take those.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay just the stool softener.

PATIENT Q755
Right.

DOCTOR Q755
Is the one you aren't taking?

PATIENT Q755
Right.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay and do you need more of the gabapentin?

PATIENT Q755
What?

DOCTOR Q755
Gabapentin is the one; I'm assuming they probably gave it to you like sometimes after you have an amputation you have sensations like you know like your leg is still there.

PATIENT Q755
Yeah I do have those.

DOCTOR Q755
You do have those.

PATIENT Q755
Right, right.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay so we'll make sure we refill those.

PATIENT Q755
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q755
Oh it looks like you're pretty much out of everything actually.

PATIENT Q755
Except that one iron pill, I have quite a few of those.

DOCTOR Q755
Yeah okay.  Let's make sure we reorder all that stuff for you then.

PATIENT Q755
Okay.

DOCTOR Q755
Do you want to pick it up here or do you have an address that it can be mailed to or?

PATIENT Q755
Well picking up is better.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay, since you're here you might as well go get it.

PATIENT Q755
Right.

DOCTOR Q755
Make sure you keep taking those vitamins too.

PATIENT Q755
Of course I'm gonna keep taking the vitamins.

DOCTOR Q755
Um sounds like you used to drink quite a bit.

PATIENT Q755
Oh yes.

DOCTOR Q755
So you probably have some vitamin deficiencies.

PATIENT Q755
Hmm.

DOCTOR Q755
Uh it is pretty hard for you to get out here?

PATIENT Q755
I just, I call for the free ride, the chauffeur.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay.

PATIENT Q755
@@@.

DOCTOR Q755
So it'd probably be easier to give you 90 day supplies, what do you think?

PATIENT Q755
That’d be good.

DOCTOR Q755
Will that work?

PATIENT Q755
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q755
Where are you living at?  Do you have somewhere to live?

PATIENT Q755
Uh-huh.  ADDRESS.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay.  You know we can change this metoprolol to; they have you on 25 every eight hours.  We could change it to once a day and that'll be easier I assume.

PATIENT Q755
You want me to take it two times a day?

DOCTOR Q755
I'll change it so it can be just once a day.

PATIENT Q755
Okay.

DOCTOR Q755
Rather than taking it @@@ times a day, that’s kind of a lot.

PATIENT Q755
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q755
Are you pretty good about taking medicines or?

PATIENT Q755
@@@ to take it, about five hours later, the one that I take two times a day.

DOCTOR Q755
Good.

PATIENT Q755
@@@ all between 6 and 6.

DOCTOR Q755
Good.  Oh it looks like we don’t have the once a day here, so we'll do it twice a day but we can change it to two times a day.

PATIENT Q755
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q755
Are you taking the aspirin still?

PATIENT Q755
Right.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay.  It must be hard for you to go to uh starting taking all these pills when you're not used to it right?

PATIENT Q755
Well @@@ muscles got kind of used to it, @@@ weights @@ take it.

DOCTOR Q755
Yeah.

PATIENT Q755
Yeah that's the way.

DOCTOR Q755
Yeah keep taking it, I know it's hard but you can.  You got plenty of support at home, people to help you out?

PATIENT Q755
Oh just me really so.

DOCTOR Q755
It's just you.

PATIENT Q755
Right.

DOCTOR Q755
You live by yourself?

PATIENT Q755
Oh no, there's another person, my roommate there.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay, okay.

PATIENT Q755
She's there yeah.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay.  And you follow up with uh, with Podiatry and everything.

PATIENT Q755
Yes I go there next when I'm done here.

DOCTOR Q755
Oh today.

PATIENT Q755
Yeah I have an appointment at 1 o'clock, a 1 o'clock appointment and a 2 o'clock with him.

DOCTOR Q755
You have a 2 o'clock appointment.

PATIENT Q755
Right.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay.

PATIENT Q755
Uh @@@ that's why I'm late.

DOCTOR Q755
Oh okay.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy before?

PATIENT Q755
I don't even know what that is.

DOCTOR Q755
Um well if you've never been to the doctor you probably haven't had it.

PATIENT Q755
No I haven't.

DOCTOR Q755
Um it's where they use um a camera and a tube and they look in your colon that goes through.

PATIENT Q755
Oh yeah, I understand that, no.

DOCTOR Q755
You've never had it before though right?

PATIENT Q755
No, no.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay.  Do you know, you know we usually actually suggest people start having them when they're 50 years old.

PATIENT Q755
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q755
Um and then have them every 10 years usually just to look for cancer.

PATIENT Q755
Okay.

DOCTOR Q755
Mainly because um we've gotten so good, well we, as doctors, not me, I don’t do them, but have gotten really good at finding them early so that if they are removed early.

PATIENT Q755
Hmm.

DOCTOR Q755
That we can prevent cancer from forming.

PATIENT Q755
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Q755
Um and then that's better than letting them you know be there, develop over time and keep developing.

PATIENT Q755
Right, right.

DOCTOR Q755
Then it causes a problem and then by the time, if you catch it late then it's um less likely that you can be cured from it.

PATIENT Q755
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q755
So um if you're up to it, if you're interested I can set you up for it.

PATIENT Q755
That's the thing, they use a camera up your.

DOCTOR Q755
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT Q755
I'd like to think about this.  @@@.

DOCTOR Q755
I know I have to actually, my dad was not very happy with him when I forced him to do it.  Why don't you think about it, next time I see you then we can?

PATIENT Q755
Okay the next appointment yeah; I'll give you the answer.

DOCTOR Q755
Okay, okay, alright.  Give me just a second okay.  

PATIENT Q755
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q755

DOCTOR Q755
Alright.

PATIENT Q755

DOCTOR Q755
So we usually, after we see you all we go and talk to our bosses to make sure we're not missing anything.

PATIENT Q755
Hmm.

DOCTOR Q755
So do you see, I know you have a Podiatry appointment today so do you think after that you can stop by the Lab?  I just want to check you know some routine things since you haven't been to the doctor like, you know like your cholesterol, your PSA just little things um.

When you go out its right across the hall um and you just sign in and I'll have the labs put into the computer that I want them to check and they'll draw some blood.  You don't have to stay and wait for them though, if there's anything abnormal I could call you with it.

PATIENT Q755
