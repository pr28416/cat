PATIENT S125
Well right now I'm trying to go twice a week.  I used to go three times but uh the last 2 1/2 years, I don't know if you remember but my wife had those strokes and she had another one in 09.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S125
That's why we went to Arizona for the winter last year.

DOCTOR S125
Okay.

PATIENT S125

DOCTOR S125
Okay.

PATIENT S125
Which I hated it, to come back.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.  Well letâ€™s see here, so you're still getting your alprazolam here.

PATIENT S125
There's one medication I came here a couple of weeks back that one of the doctors wanted canceled.

DOCTOR S125
Okay.

PATIENT S125
Uh, well I don't pronounce those words.

DOCTOR S125
Doxycycline?

PATIENT S125
Yeah.

DOCTOR S125
Now why are you taking that?

PATIENT S125
Because of my nose, it breaks out.

DOCTOR S125
Oh okay.

PATIENT S125
I get uh blisters.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S125
And uh this was recommended by Dermatology.

DOCTOR S125
Right.

PATIENT S125
Now when I, this doctor said it's no good, it could cause problems later on.

DOCTOR S125
Well it can.  How often do you use it?

PATIENT S125
Well as long as nothing pops up on my nose I don't take it.

DOCTOR S125
Right.

PATIENT S125
Sometimes I take three times a week, sometimes twice, all depends.  When I see my nose breaking out that's when I take the medication.

DOCTOR S125
So are you taking 100 mg of metoprolol now?  Cause we have you on 200 here.

PATIENT S125
Uh, what does that say 200?

DOCTOR S125
It says 100.

PATIENT S125
100 yeah.

DOCTOR S125
And we have 200.

PATIENT S125
Yeah but I've been taking half of it.

DOCTOR S125
You take half a pill?

PATIENT S125
I've been taking half of it right.

DOCTOR S125
Alright let me just change that cause.

PATIENT S125
I should have brought the bottle.

DOCTOR S125
Alright.

PATIENT S125
Now this here, this one here.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S125
Medication.

DOCTOR S125
The oxybutynin?

PATIENT S125
Yeah uh was given to me because a couple of times I find myself uh wet at night.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S125
The pajamas or I couldn't hold it so I stopped at the VA over there in Arizona and they says no you don't have an infection it just could be your bladder and I've been taking that too as I need it.

DOCTOR S125
Okay.

PATIENT S125
Now one thing I don't understand.

DOCTOR S125
Yeah.

PATIENT S125
Uh the VA Hospital, as far as I understand, regardless of where they are, you should honor the other place, their instructions or whatever.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S125
I was there and I didn't have no problem.  They registered me right away.  Uh I went to the hospital; they assigned me to a doctor.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S125
I came here and I ran a couple medications and they wouldn't give them to me, they said no, no you have to see a doctor.

DOCTOR S125
Well you know I have to actually renew the medicines.  I have to put in the order otherwise the Pharmacy can't fill it.  So that might have been what happened.

PATIENT S125
Yeah but if I, I can see if I'm out completely that I have to renew it but if it's still good, the bottle says renew a couple of more times or whatever.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S125
Why when I.

DOCTOR S125
I don't know the answer to that.  That's weird cause.  I don't really know.

PATIENT S125
Why isn't that particular medication that I'm telling you about my nose?

DOCTOR S125
Yeah that one had expired in our system.  That's why you couldn't get it.

PATIENT S125
Oh.

DOCTOR S125
So it needed to be reordered by a doctor and I've done that.

PATIENT S125
And then he only gave me enough, he gave me nine pills only.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S125
Like I say I take that when my nose breaks out.

DOCTOR S125
Right.  Alright and then are you doing the aspirin through the VA?

PATIENT S125
No.  

DOCTOR S125
You're just buying that over-the-counter?

PATIENT S125
You cut me off.

DOCTOR S125
Well you can get it here.  It's probably cheaper to just buy it over-the-counter.

PATIENT S125
Its cheaper buying over-the-counter yes, that's alright.  I can handle that one.

DOCTOR S125
I mean I can order it for you through here.

PATIENT S125
No I'll get it.

DOCTOR S125
Okay.

PATIENT S125
Uh the uh, the softener.

DOCTOR S125
Yeah.  I reordered that.

PATIENT S125
You did, good.  Cause they canceled me here one time and then I just noticed I still got it here.  Now the other medication that I'm taking is um like complex vitamin B.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S125
And stuff like that.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S125

DOCTOR S125

DOCTOR S125
Yeah we don't have that here.  That's not in our pharmacy.

PATIENT S125
And that baby's expensive.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.  That's why we don't have it in our pharmacy.

PATIENT S125
And I been taking that since I had my bypass.

DOCTOR S125
Uh-huh.  I can see if I can get it.

PATIENT S125
I had a uh blood work over there and I'm always concerned about my prostate and according to them it was real good, it was 1 point something.

DOCTOR S125
Okay.  How much of the Lovaza are you on?  Do you remember?

PATIENT S125
No it's not, I don't have it here.  I'm surprised, yeah wait a minute, wait a minute.  That's my wife's list.  I thought I had everything in order, 1 mg.

DOCTOR S125
Is that daily?  Once a day?

PATIENT S125
This?  Again I take it three times a week, four times a week because it's expensive.

DOCTOR S125
Okay.

PATIENT S125
