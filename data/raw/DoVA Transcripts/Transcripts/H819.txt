DOCTOR H819
PATIENT?


PATIENT H819
Hi.


DOCTOR H819
Did you have a nice Christmas?


PATIENT H819
Alright.


DOCTOR H819
Yes.  I saw you had, @@@ the ER for the back.


PATIENT H819
Okay, the sciatic nerve?


DOCTOR H819
Yeah.


PATIENT H819
@@@


DOCTOR H819
So you still haven’t done the MRI I see.


PATIENT H819
No?


DOCTOR H819
Did they even call you?


PATIENT H819
This, I'm supposed to get it done sometime next month.


DOCTOR H819
Next month, did they schedule it?


PATIENT H819
They scheduled it; I got the letter that says, next month.


DOCTOR H819
@@@ okay, at 8 o'clock.


PATIENT H819
Right.


DOCTOR H819
And then you're gonna see the Rehab doctor on the 7th?


PATIENT H819
Right, uh.  These things that they gave me to help me with the sciatic nerve.


DOCTOR H819
Uh-huh.


PATIENT H819
And they gave me something else and it's not doing anything.


DOCTOR H819
But the prednisone can only be given for like a very short time and so they only gave you the one week.  We can't put on that long term cause it can cause diabetes, osteoporosis along with other stuff.  So this is a steroid.  This is the Vicodin, has that been helping?


PATIENT H819
A little.  I ran out of these and uh right now I'm taking three Aleve and two Motrin.



DOCTOR H819
Okay.  Did these help when you took em?


PATIENT H819
Yeah, it wasn't @@@.


DOCTOR H819
Okay cause I can refill this.


PATIENT H819
Okay well.


DOCTOR H819
This one, I won't give you again because this is, this is a medication we give sparingly because of all the side effects.


PATIENT H819
Oh.


DOCTOR H819
Okay?  This we can, we can I can give you more of until we get you to the Rehab doctor so they can do the exercises that you need.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.


PATIENT H819
Alright and then uh could you change this nitroglycerin?


DOCTOR H819
Mometasone and what's this one?  Flunisolide.  Uh let me see if it's available.  Cause what they did is they, they went and changed it on their own when there was a shortage and this is the inhaler.  Let me see if, if this is available okay.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
How often are you doing the @@@, how often were you doing this one?


PATIENT H819
This one I was doing twice a day, once in the morning and once at night.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  Let's see if it’s . . .  So you were doing it as an inhaler right?


PATIENT H819
Right.


DOCTOR H819
Not a nasal spray, right?


PATIENT H819
No it's an inhaler.


DOCTOR H819
Yeah, see, it’s not even coming up as an option.  The problem is, they’re not even, it's not even being offered anymore.  This was in place of this.  That's not working for you or not as good?


PATIENT H819
Not as good.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  How's the uh, how's the breathing?


PATIENT H819
It's good.  I couldn't have that; I took the whatcha call the sleep study.


DOCTOR H819
I saw that.


PATIENT H819
And I couldn't fall asleep.  I went until 1:00 in the morning.


DOCTOR H819
Yeah.


PATIENT H819
So I got there at 8:30 and they hook you up and I'm just laying there tossing and turning and I couldn't go to sleep.


DOCTOR H819
That's a hell of a time though, especially for a sleep study on Christmas Eve.


PATIENT H819
Laughter.


DOCTOR H819
Laughter.  I'm surprised anyone was working in this place.  Okay, so the, they'll try to do it again.


PATIENT H819
Again yeah.


DOCTOR H819
Are you still having troubles with the shortness of breath at night?


PATIENT H819
No.


DOCTOR H819
No okay.  Um are you noticing that you're getting short of breath regularly or?


PATIENT H819
No.


DOCTOR H819
No okay.  So with what you're on, I know this is not as good as that was, but with what we have you on, the albuterol and ipratropium separately, you feel that things are okay?


PATIENT H819
Right.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  Alright and then I know that you saw the rheumatologist and they put a, they gave you a shot in your shoulder.


PATIENT H819
Uh-huh, it’s not working.


DOCTOR H819
It didn’t help.


PATIENT H819
There's another thing I wanted to talk to you about.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.


PATIENT H819
Uh, when they do the MRI on my leg, can they don one on my shoulder to see what's with the shoulder or, if I tore it again?


DOCTOR H819
Well let me see here.  Patient shoulder, @@@ emergency, @@@.


PATIENT H819
Um they won't let me go back to work.


DOCTOR H819
Who won't let you go back to work?


PATIENT H819
Uh the doctor in the ER.


DOCTOR H819
Uh-huh.


PATIENT H819
Because of the sciatic nerve.


DOCTOR H819
Uh-huh.


PATIENT H819
Because of the shoulder, they said I shouldn't go back to work.  Because last time, when I was carrying up a sheet of drywall and then all of a sudden, you know how I told you my leg would give out.


DOCTOR H819
Yes.


PATIENT H819
My leg would give out.


DOCTOR H819
Yeah.


PATIENT H819
My leg gave out again.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.


PATIENT H819
And that's when we talked and found out that it's the nerve.


DOCTOR H819
@@@ okay.


PATIENT H819
And I’ve known you now for a real long time, my leg would give out, my leg would give out.


DOCTOR H819
Yeah.


PATIENT H819
@@@ found out why.


DOCTOR H819
Well right, cause we were thinking it was the peripheral vascular disease that you had before.


PATIENT H819
Right.


DOCTOR H819
But finally that checked out, to make sure that wasn't the reason.


PATIENT H819
Right.


DOCTOR H819
And so that wasn't, so it's probably the nerve.


PATIENT H819
Right.


DOCTOR H819
So we'll see what the MRI shows.  Um, you know.


PATIENT H819
Well you think you can do my shoulder?


DOCTOR H819
Yeah I'll order it.


PATIENT H819
You know, both of them at one time.


DOCTOR H819
It's your right shoulder right?


PATIENT H819
Correct.


DOCTOR H819
You have no implants or foreign objects?


PATIENT H819
No.


DOCTOR H819
Shrapnel, none of that stuff?


PATIENT H819
No.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  You're not claustrophobic?


PATIENT H819
No.


DOCTOR H819
Okay, now I have to do it all over again.  But so the shoulder is unchanged?


PATIENT H819
Right.


DOCTOR H819
When you're taking the Vicodin was that helping at all with the shoulder?


PATIENT H819
Yeah, it, you know between the Vicodin and the Aleve.


DOCTOR H819
Uh-huh.


PATIENT H819
Because I was still taking the Aleve with the uh with the Vicodin.


DOCTOR H819
Uh-huh.


PATIENT H819
Uh, I was doing alright.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.


PATIENT H819
Nobody, @@@ try to get everything fixed so I can get off the pills.


DOCTOR H819
Right.  No I understand.  And you're going on the 5th, so let me just think if I can just schedule it for then. (DOCTOR working on computer)  Huh, just to make sure you have the blood work.  Well, they're going to require some basic blood work before this MRI so we're gonna need it regardless.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
So I'm just gonna order it okay.  So alright, so and then so for the shoulder we'll get an MRI.  You're gonna see the Rehab doctors.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
And um and we'll go for and then I'll renew the um, I will renew the Vicodin.


PATIENT H819
Okay and that stuff that you guys gave me for the fungus is working too.


DOCTOR H819
Good, good and it doesn't put your liver at risk for failure so I'm glad.  That's improving?


PATIENT H819
Yes.  My toes have practically cleared up.


DOCTOR H819
Good.


PATIENT H819
You know and this one is.


DOCTOR H819
Yeah, okay.


PATIENT H819
Come along real good too.


DOCTOR H819
Good.  Uh let's see.  Now the Vicodin, do you want to pick it up or do you want it to be mailed to you?


PATIENT H819
No I'll pick it up.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.


PATIENT H819
That's it.


DOCTOR H819
No problem.  Okay.  So let me see if there's anything else that we need to look at.  So what's going on with your liver?  Are you gonna go back to the Liver Clinic or what?


PATIENT H819
Yes.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  When are you planning to do that?


PATIENT H819
They, they told me as soon as I get rid of all this fungus to give them a call.


DOCTOR H819
Perfect.


PATIENT H819
Because of uh the.


DOCTOR H819
Right they don't want to deal with active infection okay good.  So we're making headway on the fungus and then once that's under control then you'll go back to see the Liver.


PATIENT H819
Right.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  For the sciatica we have ya, pain medicines, so we're gonna get the MRI as well as the neurologists you're gonna see, those are the nerve doctors.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
And you have an appointment to see them in early February, but by then you'll have the MRI, we'll have the rehab going and see how you do with those.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  The asthma is stable so that's good.  Okay.  Do you need any of your other medicines refilled?


PATIENT H819
Uh no I don't think so.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  Now let me just look here to see if there's any other tests done.  


PATIENT H819
And they said the Albuterol there's only one refill left?


DOCTOR H819
Okay, I'll take a look at it, one second.  We should, while we're doing your blood work today I'm gonna check your PSA, that's that prostate test that we do, it's just a blood test.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  And then in terms of your medicines so, you've got 4 on that, 6 on that,  your albuterol looks like @@@ renew those.  Uh you want to pick up, you want go pick up your inhalers while you’re down there or do you want them mailed to you?


PATIENT H819
I can pick them up.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  You'll get these too.


PATIENT H819
Sign in @@@ by the time the bloodwork is done.


DOCTOR H819
Exactly.  


PATIENT H819
Questions, all these meds that I'm taking seem to make my blood pressure right now, they said it was kind of high.  Do you think it could be this that's affecting my blood pressure?


DOCTOR H819
Um no.  I'm gonna repeat your blood pressure though.  Are you in any pain right now?


PATIENT H819
Just my leg.


DOCTOR H819
How bad is your pain?


PATIENT H819
It's, it's up there.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  Pain can cause your blood pressure to go up so on a scale of 1 to 10 how high?


PATIENT H819
6.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.


PATIENT H819
6 you know.


DOCTOR H819
So I'll repeat your blood pressure but that's not uncommon.  When people are having pain that makes their blood pressure go up so, I'm not going to start you on blood pressure medicine because once we remove the pain your blood pressures will look fine, you see what I'm saying?


PATIENT H819
Yeah.


DOCTOR H819
So we take a falsely elevated blood pressure cause of pain.  So we want to be able to treat the pain not the blood pressure.


PATIENT H819
Alright.


DOCTOR H819
The blood pressure will normalize once we get rid of the pain okay.

PATIENT H819
Cause you know I've never had, you know.


DOCTOR H819
I know.


PATIENT H819
I've never had you know blood pressure, you know high blood pressure you know but.


DOCTOR H819
Yeah, no, that's the reason why because the pain is, it's because you're having pain.  Not uncommon to have it happen.  Okay.  Why don’t you sit over here for me.


PATIENT H819
Uh it hurts to put pressure on the foot.

DOCTOR H819
Yeah.


PATIENT H819
It's all.


DOCTOR H819
All the way down.


PATIENT H819
I can feel it in my toes.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  


PATIENT H819
@@@.


DOCTOR H819
Uh, I'll probably give you a @@@.  Plus sometimes the machines out there are not calibrated regularly so that the blood pressure might be a little inaccurate but the main reason is usually pain.  Okay, now I'll hold up your arm, just relax it.   Okay, the number is 144/82.  The top number is still high but again as I said when you're in pain, we expect that.  Let me just type that in the computer.  I just want finishing examining you okay?  Deep breath.


PATIENT H819
(Breathes)


DOCTOR H819
Okay good.  Just breathe normally.  Okay.  Come and sit down over here.  Remind me, have you had a colonoscopy?


PATIENT H819
Yes.


DOCTOR H819
How long ago has that been?


PATIENT H819
Oh about a year I guess.


DOCTOR H819
And it was done here?


PATIENT H819
Yes.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  So I think we have a plans for everything.  So, in the meantime, if we can figure out why you're having so much issue with your back, which is also the sciatica.  So continue the Vicodin and we'll do everything else.  Okay, they can do physical therapy with you to hopefully, help alleviate the stress on that nerve and try to get this improved okay.


PATIENT H819
I @@@.


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  It's not uncommon that can happen.  But usually it happens with guys because they tuck their wallet in their back pocket and they sit like you know, whenever you sit down the pressure compressing on the nerve and then it just causes injury and it causes the pain.  So that's usually, that's usually the number one culprit to be honest with you.


PATIENT H819
Your wallet.


DOCTOR H819
Your wallet being in the back pocket and then once we like tell people to take your wallet out of your back pocket, then all of a sudden they feel much better.  But I'm not sure, you know yours, since yours was so severe, we need, I think we should see what the MRI shows, if there's anything else, if there's something particular in the back that's still pushing on it or what, what's going on okay?


PATIENT H819
Alright.


DOCTOR H819
Um alright.  Okay.  Let me go talk to my boss, I'll be right back okay?


PATIENT H819
Can you still give me the @@@?


DOCTOR H819
Uh yeah and here I can take them.


(DOCTOR OUT:  41:37  DOCTOR IN:  47:50)


DOCTOR H819
Okay.  So you are all set.  So um, I put in that order for the MRI and I asked if they'd do it the same day that they're doing your back, so hopefully they can accommodate that okay.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
And then if the MRI of the shoulder shows something that's you know, grossly abnormal then I'll refer you back to the Ortho so they can evaluate you, okay?


PATIENT H819
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR H819
Um and then you're gonna get the, you're gonna continue in Podiatry and you have a plan for everything.  We just need to get these tests done so that we can see you know, whether it's from the @@@ or not and then we'll, we'll go based on that.  Alright.  Is there anything else that you need?


PATIENT H819
Let me know when you want me to come back for the results of the MRI.


DOCTOR H819
So the result of the MRI, the MRI is typically read um about a week, within a week, generally after, give it a weeks’ time after it's done.  So what I would do is just call the office here um like the next week so you're getting it done January 5th, so like you would be the 10th or something.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
And then I will look at it and I can call you with the results.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
Okay and just call and say you're asking for your MRI results that's all.


PATIENT H819
Okay.


DOCTOR H819
Okay and that will give me a reminder as well to look.  I'm gonna look but just go ahead and ask for a reminder and I'll give you a call with the results.  Alright, you're all set.


PATIENT H819
Okay.  Thank you.


DOCTOR H819
Uh-huh.


PATIENT H819
Happy New Year.  


DOCTOR H819
Yeah you too.  Hopefully we'll get to the bottom of this huh.  @@@.  Okay all good to go.  Thank you, have a great holiday sir.

PATIENT H819
You too.  Happy New Year.

DOCTOR H819
You have a Happy New Year.
