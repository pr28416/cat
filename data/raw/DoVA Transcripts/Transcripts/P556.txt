Time of Encounter:  @@@ 

DOCTOR P556
PATIENT?

PATIENT P556
Oh yes.

DOCTOR P556
Yeah, follow me.

PATIENT P556
@@@ me.

DOCTOR P556
@@@. 

PATIENT P556
@@@.  Grand Central Station here.

DOCTOR P556
I'm sorry, @@@.

PATIENT P556
Oh I'm doing alright.

DOCTOR P556
@@@.

PATIENT P556
I'm sort of getting all hospitalized out, @@@ hospitals.  Research projects, University of Illinois and uh I was upstairs for two days as an inpatient just to get a spinal tap.

DOCTOR P556
Okay for what?

PATIENT P556
Okay, well I got the spinal tap, I'm out of breath just give me a second.  I got the spinal tap uh because uh my neurologist DOCTOR.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Uh felt it would be useful in determining and I'm speaking as a civilian non-medical person, the uh nature of my neuropathy I have uh bilateral sensory polyneuropathy.

DOCTOR P556
Hmm.

PATIENT P556
In both legs and it's crawling up to, in fact I just noticed last night, it's like pretty very close to my knees, right next to my knees, although it's not 100% that high but what Iâ€™m trying to say is I've got neuropathy in the feet and legs and uh since 1998 and that is when she first diagnosed it.  Then uh I'm also worried about the fact that I have it, I'm just going to take a while just to say about, I've lost about 40% of the feeling in my hands, maybe more.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
And I've also got edema, I've got gout in the right wrist and I've got edema which is causing all these marks which are called @@@ disease.

DOCTOR P556
So why did they do the tap?

PATIENT P556
Well to find the nature of my neuropathy.  

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
See if they can determine uh what is causing it or whatever.  Now that was last Tuesday finally, I had a successful spinal tap.

DOCTOR P556
Alright.

PATIENT P556
The first two attempts were not good uh by DOCTOR.  He was brand new; I don't think he had done them before.  If I heard him correctly.  And then uh your doctor in Interventional Radiology with an Armenian name, @@@ he did it in Radiology Tuesday of last week.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
Um I don't want to uh, it's not fair for me to bother you I suppose.  Is there any remarkable comment by the uh, by the radiologist or I mean yeah by the radiologist relating to the uh?

DOCTOR P556
Done here?

PATIENT P556
Yeah, it's the spinal tap here in Radiology.  I'm just curious if there's anything that stands out as a result of that spinal tap or whatever, the lumbar or whatever it is.

DOCTOR P556
When was it?

PATIENT P556
It was last Tuesday, let's see today is what like the 29th?

DOCTOR P556
Hmm.

PATIENT P556
So it would have been the 20, am I right in saying yeah the 22nd, 22nd of September.

DOCTOR P556
And the culture was negative.

PATIENT P556
The culture was negative?

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
For anything disastrous. Or anything deleterious as they say.  Nothing relating to Agent Orange or dioxin or anything of that sort I'm sure.  I think dioxin could only be, so I understand that it can only be found to @@@ blood @@@.

DOCTOR P556
From what I can find here, so far it just a negative.  There are some things that are pending.

PATIENT P556
Oh still pending okay.  Now I'll mention one other important thing that's happened just recently.  In fact Friday um now, when I was in the hospital for the spinal tap they gave me blood tests for other miscellaneous things here.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
Um and then I got a call last Friday from your, I don't know the exactly you know the TeleNurse or whatever it is.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Telephone Nurse, whatever that is.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
And she said I'm calling about your high blood pressure and your diabetes okay.  Now I've never been formerly diagnosed by any doctor with diabetes okay.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Um now, I did have a high glucose level about six, you know six or eight weeks ago here okay.  Very high, it was like after I'd eaten a lot of cherries you know okay.

DOCTOR P556
How high?

PATIENT P556
It was like 175 I believe.

DOCTOR P556
After eating?

PATIENT P556
After eating a lot of sweet cherries.

DOCTOR P556
Uh huh.

PATIENT P556
Okay.  Now the point is, was something found.

DOCTOR P556
@@@.

PATIENT P556
Uh 10 days ago or there about, not eight days ago, from the blood tests that were taken relating to uh whether I have been recently diagnosed by anybody with having diabetes?

DOCTOR P556
As far as I can find here no.  So I don't know who called you or why or.

PATIENT P556
Well it was the nurse.  It was the Tele whatever it is and that's what she says.

DOCTOR P556
From here, from the VA?

PATIENT P556
From the VA here and uh they call after a patient has been an inpatient you know.

DOCTOR P556
Everything's @@@.

PATIENT P556
And I said is this formal notification that I've been diagnosed with diabetes and she said no and she wanted to get off the telephone quickly.  She didn't want to deal with the problem you know.

DOCTOR P556
Did you end up getting the follow-up colonoscopy?

PATIENT P556
Uh I had a colonoscopy roughly, I'm gonna say you know, seven or eight months ago okay.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
I had at least 13 polyps taken out.  I'm like a polyp farm you know.  I had like 13 polyps taken out.  Now uh in two previous colonoscopies and let's just say the last three years, in two that were six months apart I had lots of polyps taken out.  I'm gonna say um you know 13 or 14 or something on that order and the thing that sort of worries me is that my next follow-up colonoscopy is not for three years from the date of the last one okay, which would have been.

DOCTOR P556
Who told you that?

PATIENT P556
That's the letter that I got from the GI Clinic that said it would be three years okay.  Now they said if I have any questions call the clinic and the recording said someone will get back to me within a day and a half or two days or something.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
No one ever got back to me um and uh the reason I called is because if they're taking out you know two dozen polyps over a short period of time pretty much, the question becomes should I wait three years for the next colonoscopy?

DOCTOR P556
Yes.  Yes.

PATIENT P556
Well the reason, the only reason I say that is because um when 2 1/2, 3 years ago when I had a colonoscopy and they took a lot of them out.  I forget the exact number.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
It might have been seven or six or something I called and talked with a GI doctor.  At that time I was successful in talking with the GI doctor after the polyps were taken out and I said my next colonoscopy isn't planned for several years, you know based on the number of polyps they've taken out in the last two times uh should I wait that long.  He said you know you're right, you should not wait several years you should have one soon, which I had; I'm just going to guestimate about one year later or less.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Okay.  Um so you know I'm willing to go along with whatever you think.

DOCTOR P556
Uh.

PATIENT P556
But just keep in mind, the last time 13 polyps.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
You know.  I'm just so, you're thinking even if I get a lot of polyps, they're not gonna be necessarily cancerous within three years but the odds are fairly low, that's probably what you're saying.

DOCTOR P556
Um well the uh it always depends on the pathology.

PATIENT P556
Okay.

DOCTOR P556
Um if any more than.

PATIENT P556
There's one flat polyp recently that whatever, you know I don't know the technical names.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Well there was one flat polyp which I understand are more dangerous.

DOCTOR P556
Yeah.  So.

PATIENT P556
There was one, the rest were what are they called plastic polyps or something?

DOCTOR P556
Hyperplastic

PATIENT P556
Whatever they are yeah.

DOCTOR P556
So when was the last gout flare you had?

PATIENT P556
Oh yeah well, depending on whatever your definition is, I three or four or five times I've felt a gout flare-up starting on my right wrist which it was diagnosed about a year and a half ago.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
I had two flare-ups then.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
But I had.

DOCTOR P556
Are you taking anything?

PATIENT P556
What starts as flare-ups but and it actually sort of went into gout probably.

DOCTOR P556
Are you taking allopurinol or?

PATIENT P556
I sure am, every other day.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
But uh I haven't had a long, I had actually weeks, I've had a couple of instances of not being really able to lift things with my right arm because of the gout but it didn't last, it only lasts a week or so.

DOCTOR P556
Are you still taking the Coumadin or are you on aspirin?

PATIENT P556
No I'm on aspirin therapy.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
I was on Coumadin for several years for a-fib.

DOCTOR P556
So why did they stop the Coumadin?

PATIENT P556
Well I lost, believe it or not, when I had my left toe and the first ray of my foot amputated December 7th, following that I've lost, believe it or not, at least four and maybe five pints of blood which were replaced both here in this hospital and at St. Francis Hospital where I was brought, the same within 12 hours after I went to the nursing home.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
I was taken to St. Francis Hospital from the nursing home, I lost several pints of blood and I was given several pints of blood at St. Francis Hospital in Evanston.  Uh I was given blood here, maybe one or two pints that I lost through the toe.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh, yeah.

PATIENT P556
That had been amputated so uh the podiatrist left me on the Coumadin while I had the surgery.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
I think probably because they feel they can tie off the foot so that it won't bleed during surgery.

DOCTOR P556
Yeah but.

PATIENT P556
So I'm not sure they were thinking too much about post surgery.

DOCTOR P556
Uh are you still cathing yourself?

PATIENT P556
Yes.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
Eight to ten times a day.  I've probably done it 20,000 times, literally 20,000 times.

DOCTOR P556
@@@ still?

PATIENT P556
Uh every six months or so.

DOCTOR P556
Okay, okay.

PATIENT P556
I still have an atonic bladder.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
That's the main reason and also another name for it.

DOCTOR P556
And you're still taking your vitamin B12 supplement?

PATIENT P556
Yes I'm due in fact to take it tomorrow, uh the B12.  I shoot the B12 with whatever you call it.

DOCTOR P556
Okay and then you're still seeing the kidney doctors?

PATIENT P556
The what doctors?

DOCTOR P556
Kidney.

PATIENT P556
Um I have an appointment for November 1st, I'm gonna try to get in even sooner.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
Uh just to check the status of my uh.

DOCTOR P556
So you're taking Tylenol, allopurinol, amlodipine uh aspirin, uh calcitriol.

PATIENT P556
What's the last one you said?

DOCTOR P556
@@@.

PATIENT P556
@@@.

DOCTOR P556
For your @@@.

PATIENT P556
Oh yes by the way does it show, does that is still active as far as you can see there?

DOCTOR P556
Yeah.

PATIENT P556
Or you know.

DOCTOR P556
The diltiazem.

PATIENT P556
I take that every other day.

DOCTOR P556
Diltiazem.

PATIENT P556
Yes.

DOCTOR P556
Finasteride, @@@?

PATIENT P556
Yep, yep.

DOCTOR P556
Folic acid?

PATIENT P556
Yep.

DOCTOR P556
Lasix, the furosemide.

PATIENT P556
Yep.

DOCTOR P556
Do you do 1 1/2 tablets twice a day?

PATIENT P556
That's correct.

DOCTOR P556
Um gabapentin?

PATIENT P556
Yes uh yes.

DOCTOR P556
@@@ bedtime.

PATIENT P556
Uh yes, it's very odd.  As you can see, in fact I even quit that for quite a while off and on because it makes me fall asleep during the day so DOCTOR said well just try to take it when you go to sleep.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
When you're trying to get to sleep.

DOCTOR P556
Um lisinopril?

PATIENT P556
Yes.

DOCTOR P556
Half a tablet.

PATIENT P556
Half a tablet twice a day.

DOCTOR P556
And metoprolol?

PATIENT P556
Yes two.

DOCTOR P556
Twice a day.

PATIENT P556
Two tablets, one tablet twice a day.

DOCTOR P556
Yes.  Uh and then the thiamine.

PATIENT P556
Yes.

DOCTOR P556
Anything else?

PATIENT P556
Those are, that's.

DOCTOR P556
@@@.

PATIENT P556
You've got the, what was that?

DOCTOR P556
That's pretty much it?

PATIENT P556
Yeah that's pretty much it yeah.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.  So.

PATIENT P556
So uh so you didn't glance at anything uh I @@@ want to take this boot off, I'd be happy to.

DOCTOR P556
Pretty swollen.

PATIENT P556
Oh yeah that's been the big problem.  

DOCTOR P556
The swelling?

PATIENT P556
My uh you know a couple of months ago I was sent by Podiatry to a local prosthetics place.  They gave me a diabetic shoe to be fitted because I have ulcers.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
And they're now very close to being healed.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
But what's stopping the healing or hurting me is the what do you call the edema.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Which I had, in fact the very day, the very day I went to the prosthetics place near my home.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Uh my feet and legs swell up.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
With edema and you know I'm coming on to my non-medical opinion.

DOCTOR P556
Deep breath for me okay.

PATIENT P556
Yep.

DOCTOR P556
Deep breaths.  Any fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT P556
Uh I, every three months, including about two weeks ago I had uh, I had uh chills.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
And uh.

DOCTOR P556
@@@.

PATIENT P556
What felt like and I had a small fever.  It's every three months or so I get that and it lasts usually you know about eight or ten hours overnight and then it goes away. Iâ€™ve always suspected in my non-medical way that it has something to do with my kidney disease which I have.  At one time I just, maybe stage five kidney disease and then they got my blood pressure under control and I went back to stage three.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Now it's probably lingering around stage four.

DOCTOR P556
Any uh vomiting, diarrhea?

PATIENT P556
Uh no I'm pretty good.

DOCTOR P556
Any blood in your stool?

PATIENT P556
No except, except blood, I was diagnosed here and when I had the colonoscopy as internal hemorrhoids of the anus.

DOCTOR P556
Um do you need refills of your medications today?

PATIENT P556
Uh the only thing, I'll being going there, I don't think you would have to worry about this.  Uh except to say one thing, I'm going over, there's a lady who takes care of catheters.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
I can't remember her name.  She has a real odd name uh I'll be seeing her today to get a renewal.  As long as I have a renewal, I'd like renewals left on my catheters that you might be able to notice there and on my lube gel, the gel that is used with catheters.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
Did you notice?  That's the one thing I'm concerned about.

DOCTOR P556
You have six refills on the lubricant jelly.

PATIENT P556
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P556
And then 11 refills.

PATIENT P556
On catheters?

DOCTOR P556
10 refills.

PATIENT P556
Oh that's good.  Now there's only one other quick thing.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
A doctor, I'm trying to remember, oh you know what it was he was a hematologist.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
And I was discussing briefly with him about three weeks ago, thereabouts roughly, uh the uh diabetes.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
And uh.

DOCTOR P556
You don't have any.

PATIENT P556
Well apparently not.

DOCTOR P556
No.

PATIENT P556
Okay uh by the way can I bother, do you recall what my glucose was, I assume they took my glucose like 10 days ago when I was here in the hospital for the spinal tap?

DOCTOR P556
The last glucose was 82.

PATIENT P556
82?  About ten days ago or something like that?

DOCTOR P556
On the 21st.

PATIENT P556
No, did you say the 21st, yeah.

DOCTOR P556
Yeah.

PATIENT P556
No kidding?

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Well that's great right.

DOCTOR P556
No you're good.  Your kidneys are looking good, everything is.

PATIENT P556
Well my kidneys, believe first of all my left kidney I was told two years ago is dead.  It's atrophied and now other doctors have said well maybe it's not quite dead but it's near its.

DOCTOR P556
Yeah but you don't have diabetes though.

PATIENT P556
Oh yeah well that's the best news I've had all day.  I was just gonna ask one question.

DOCTOR P556
Yes.

PATIENT P556
Remember I said like the hematologist.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Hematologist I got on the subject of diabetes.  He said the next time you have a blood test; it would be good to have what you call the A.

DOCTOR P556
A1c.

PATIENT P556
I think it was an A1c.

DOCTOR P556
You had it last year.

PATIENT P556
I had one last year.

DOCTOR P556
In May and it was fine.

PATIENT P556
It was okay.

DOCTOR P556
Yeah.

PATIENT P556
Oh do you have 5.9 or something like that yeah okay so and plus what you're telling me about the 21st is good news.

DOCTOR P556
Yeah.

PATIENT P556
So I don't.

DOCTOR P556
They checked your sugars and they were all fine.

PATIENT P556
Yeah he said the next time I had blood tests to get an A1c but that was before the good news that you just told me about that.

DOCTOR P556
Yeah.

PATIENT P556
Yeah.

DOCTOR P556
No your sugars look fine.  I doubt really that much would be new.

PATIENT P556
Yeah.  Now I'll be seeing the Renal on November 1st.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
I'll be seeing, I'll be getting the results of the spinal tap.  I'm going to make an appointment for an EMG.  I think it's for getting the results of the spinal tap.

DOCTOR P556
Okay I'll be right back.

PATIENT P556
Okay.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  39:53  DOCTOR IN:  53:31)

DOCTOR P556
Um when do you follow up with Neurology again?

PATIENT P556
I do not haveâ€¦ I'm about to make an appointment in the next 20 minutes.  I believe they're working the floors right now in the hospital.

DOCTOR P556
You don't need any refills or you do?

PATIENT P556
I don't believe I need refills but the only thing I would ask of you is see, you know I probably won't be back here until you tell me, it's three, four, five, six months.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.  

PATIENT P556
Now if that's the case do you see anything on there?  Is it difficult for you to decide if uh let's say I need additional what do you call it, um you know, additional refills on especially for instance blood pressure medication?

DOCTOR P556
Um.

PATIENT P556
Is it hard to make that out?  I'm gonna take a wild guess and say it's gonna be closer to six months that I probably would not be back here unless you indicate differently.

DOCTOR P556
Um I was going to say four months.

PATIENT P556
Uh-huh sure that would be great uh.

DOCTOR P556
Um let's see.

PATIENT P556
Something's always coming up.

DOCTOR P556
Um.

PATIENT P556
As long as I've got enough to get me through, let's say four months.  If it seems like I do, terrific but.

DOCTOR P556
You can always call.

PATIENT P556
Yeah that's, yeah.  That can be a little problematical but that's okay.

DOCTOR P556
Um.

PATIENT P556
Yeah.

DOCTOR P556
For your swelling, for the next three days.

PATIENT P556
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P556
Instead of doing 1 1/2 of the furosemide.

PATIENT P556
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P556
Do the full two tablets.

PATIENT P556
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.

PATIENT P556
Okay.

DOCTOR P556
For three days only.

PATIENT P556
Yeah.

DOCTOR P556
Starting tomorrow.

PATIENT P556
I suspect.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
That they, you know, by the way I'm like it's always difficult to tell with me when I have active @@@ which I've had in the past.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Um uh and so what I'm trying to get at is you know a lot of the swelling might have been, started with you know active @@@ fluid or something which they indicated.

DOCTOR P556
@@@.

PATIENT P556
In the last few months.

DOCTOR P556
It's hard to say that it's that or if your kidneys or if it's.

PATIENT P556
Yeah, right, exactly.  However, uh my suspicion based upon only, my non-medical suspicion.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
Non-medically trained suspicion is that uh you know I read an article recently that said you know uh edema is sometimes caused by inactivity and in my particular case you know the podiatrist you know uh seemed happiest when I simply had my feet up and I'm not really getting, because I had ulcers on the toes you know the remaining toes that I have.

DOCTOR P556
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P556
And uh they're happiest when I'm not doing a lot of walking.  So that's what I suspect is a large part of the problem.

DOCTOR P556
Do you check your...

PATIENT P556
So I'll be seeing them very soon, I have two appointments to make today.  One is with the uh.

DOCTOR P556
The foot doctor.

PATIENT P556
Is the foot doctor and one is with.

DOCTOR P556
Neurologist.

PATIENT P556
Neurologist yes.

DOCTOR P556
Good yeah so I mean so far youâ€™re doing @@@.

PATIENT P556
But you don't think I should wait three years to follow up with the colonoscopy?

DOCTOR P556
Well we can talk next time, you're still not due.

PATIENT P556
Oh okay.

DOCTOR P556
You just had one.

PATIENT P556
Alright.

DOCTOR P556
So.

PATIENT P556
Okay.  I'm uh.

DOCTOR P556
Right now you're good.

PATIENT P556
Yeah I'm just a little worried.  My father died of colon cancer and my mother seemed to have had it.

DOCTOR P556
Okay, next time you come we can go over the whole pathology.

PATIENT P556
Yeah.

DOCTOR P556
@@@ exactly what they found.

PATIENT P556
Well I may, what I've been really putting off is that I may call the GI doctors.

DOCTOR P556
Hmm.

PATIENT P556
Again and just see.

DOCTOR P556
See what they say.

PATIENT P556
And just reset that one.

DOCTOR P556
Yeah.

PATIENT P556
Alright so uh.

DOCTOR P556
But you're doing good, you're doing good.

PATIENT P556
Oh that's great.

DOCTOR P556
Um depending what they find on the results of the lumbar puncture.

PATIENT P556
Yeah.

DOCTOR P556
Then, neuro - I'm guessing you'll see Neurology by that time and they can see if there's anything you need for the different @@@.

PATIENT P556
Yeah, yeah.  My overwhelming and key thing right now is my kidneys you know and.

DOCTOR P556
And @@@.

PATIENT P556
And maybe I'm gonna need dialysis.

DOCTOR P556
Dialysis, very true.

PATIENT P556
Okay.

DOCTOR P556
Have a great day okay.

PATIENT P556
Thank you for putting up with me, I appreciate it.

DOCTOR P556
No problem.

PATIENT P556
Okay.

DOCTOR P556
Okay.
