PATIENT S459
Yes.

DOCTOR S459
Yeah cause I know you were seen by the kidney doctors and they said you absolutely do not want dialysis is that right?

PATIENT S459
Right.

DOCTOR S459
Still taking all your medications?

PATIENT S459
Yes I, right now I used the last one and I run out of this one here.  This one I run out @@@.

DOCTOR S459
This is the one the kidney doctors prescribed you right?

PATIENT S459
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR S459
See if they refilled it for you.  You should still be on the calcium carbonate, let's just see what they said.  Are you taking the kayexalate that's uh the thing they gave you at the uh kidney doctors?  Like that liquid stuff?

PATIENT S459
The liquid stuff.

DOCTOR S459
Yeah you still taking that?

PATIENT S459
Uh I haven't taken any of that stuff yet.

DOCTOR S459
You haven't taken any of it yet?

PATIENT S459
No.

DOCTOR S459
Why not?

PATIENT S459
I don't know.

DOCTOR S459
You should start taking it.

PATIENT S459
Alright.

DOCTOR S459
Cause they're worried because your potassium was really high and that can cause you to have a heart attack.

PATIENT S459
Alright.

DOCTOR S459
And we don't want that.

PATIENT S459
Alright.

DOCTOR S459
Okay.  So start taking that.  Can I see that medication bottle one more time the one you said you’re out of.  Okay I refilled this.  What about the rest of your meds?  Do you still have all those?

PATIENT S459
Yes.

DOCTOR S459
Yeah.

PATIENT S459
I have some refills.

DOCTOR S459
I want to make sure you have enough to last you till your next appointment.  I think you're gonna run out so I'm gonna refill everything for you okay.

PATIENT S459
Alright.  They usually send it to me when I run out.

DOCTOR S459
Yeah they usually send it to you but if you run out then they can't send it to you right.  Like if you run out of refills.

PATIENT S459
I thought they should know when I run out.

DOCTOR S459
Yeah they do and that's why we have to refill them for you before they run out of refills.  Make sense?

PATIENT S459
I don't know.

DOCTOR S459
(Laughter)  You know what, I see you're gonna be seeing the kidney doctors in, let’s see, do you have an appointment coming up with the kidney doctors?

PATIENT S459
I don't know when the next appointment is.  I ain't got nothing @@@ or anything. 

DOCTOR S459
They wanted to see you back in a month and that was back in November so I think we need to schedule you for a follow-up kidney doctor appointment okay.

PATIENT S459
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S459
Other than that you're doing okay though huh?

PATIENT S459
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S459
Okay.  Want to have a seat up here for me and I can examine you?  I'm looking to see when the last time we got a cholesterol panel on you.  Can you look straight ahead for me?  Open your mouth, stick your tongue out and say ah.

PATIENT S459
Ah.

DOCTOR S459
Give me some big deep breaths.  Good, breathe normally.  Good.  Numbness or tingling in your fingers or toes?

PATIENT S459
No.

DOCTOR S459
Stomach pain?

PATIENT S459
No.

DOCTOR S459
Okay, alright.  Give me a few minutes.  Let me go talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  32:54  DOCTOR IN:  49:40)

SECOND DOCTOR S459
Hey PATIENT.

PATIENT S459
Hi.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
How are you?

PATIENT S459
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
Okay.  Um are you watching your diet and @@@ off the potassium?

PATIENT S459
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR S459
High potassium diet.

PATIENT S459
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
You're watching like bananas, oranges okay.  But you haven't taken that sweet liquid?

PATIENT S459
Hmm?

SECOND DOCTOR S459
The kayexalate, the one that tastes really sweet? 

PATIENT S459
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
Do you have it at home?

PATIENT S459
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
You do, okay.  I'm going to check your potassium again today so I don't want you to leave.  I want you to come back after your blood tests done and just wait out there because I need to make sure it's not too dangerously elevated and PATIENT your kidney function is deteriorating quite fast - quite rapidly and I think the dialysis is eminent.  So I think you need to come to the conclusion that you really need it otherwise you I mean this is life-threatening.  You may not need it immediately but that might be in near future and you will need it.  What is that you are concerned about?  A lot of people are on dialysis.  They start even at the age of 85, I have a patient, an 85 year old who just started on dialysis.

PATIENT S459
Well I.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
And they do fine.

PATIENT S459
Don't like the idea, going for three hours and sit and I don't like that.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
Well you are otherwise doing okay.  I think that dialysis is I mean.  I mean unfortunately we don't have any other way to take care of your kidneys.  I don't think it's.  I mean the idea is bad to start it but once you get used to it I'm sure you'll.  I mean it's not as bad as you think.

PATIENT S459
Well I'll never get used to it.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
But the problem is, it’s better than uh I mean that it's going to be your life support measure.  Without it.

PATIENT S459
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
People die.

PATIENT S459
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
You're not there yet but I'm sure that I want you to get used to the idea.

PATIENT S459
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
So you do not decline.  That's what @@@.  That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

PATIENT S459
Yeah @@@.  I have to give it some thought.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
Okay because I don't want you to just, just without any thinking.

PATIENT S459
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR S459
Uh not.  Okay.  Alright.  So do the blood, wait out there and meanwhile make your kidney doctors appointment okay.

PATIENT S459
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR S459
Alright so I want you to go to the Lab and get your blood drawn and then come back here okay.  And up front they're gonna schedule you in the clinic.  So I want you to go up front, schedule the appointment, go to the Lab get your blood drawn and come back here okay.

PATIENT S459
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR S459
Okay.
