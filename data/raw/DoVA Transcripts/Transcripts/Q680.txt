DOCTOR Q680
Out of work a good thing? @@@.

PATIENT Q680
No a bad thing.

DOCTOR Q680
The bad things, oh @@@ that.

PATIENT Q680
That's why I've been gaining weight.  Well I knew I was gaining because I used to work out all the time.

DOCTOR Q680
Yeah.

PATIENT Q680

DOCTOR Q680
Yeah I mean If you want to follow it’s okay.  Basically they said that you're doing so good that uh the Coronary Therapy @@@.

PATIENT Q680
Oh not, would I be given any tests or anything?

DOCTOR Q680
So we.

PATIENT Q680
My wife is worried because she says @@@ not doing anything?

DOCTOR Q680
No, no.  The most important thing to do is and you've had stents in the past is make sure your cholesterol is well controlled, your blood pressure and your weight.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q680
That's the best way to prove that you won't have uh heart atack

PATIENT Q680
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q680
Or have to use another stent.  We don't usually do stress tests on a regular basis.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q680
And we don't use echos or any kind of angiograms or anything unless you have pains or symptoms.

PATIENT Q680
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q680
If you were to have any chest pain at all you would need one of those.

PATIENT Q680
Okay.

DOCTOR Q680
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT Q680
Alright.

DOCTOR Q680
But since you've done so good since your stents.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q680
That it's not really indicated unless you have some new symptoms.

PATIENT Q680
Okay.

DOCTOR Q680
So it's not like you can go on regular tests for your heart.  The most important test for your heart is cholesterol and blood pressure.

PATIENT Q680
Oh okay.  So that would be checked @@@.

DOCTOR Q680
Yeah, we would definitely check it.

PATIENT Q680
Okay, cholesterol.

DOCTOR Q680
Typically we check your cholesterol every year at least.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q680
And um.

PATIENT Q680
Okay.

DOCTOR Q680
We normally do tests at least once or twice a year for your potassium because you're on the lisinopril.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q680
And the lisinopril could increase your potassium.

PATIENT Q680
Okay.

DOCTOR Q680
Okay.  Your potassium levels are fine, it's never been a problem but every time we check your cholesterol that's something we can check.

PATIENT Q680
Okay.

DOCTOR Q680
Alright now like I said you're due for a potassium test.  So if you decide, after you're done, we might have you go down there and have them just check it real quick.

PATIENT Q680
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Q680
And we're going to see if your potassium is okay.

PATIENT Q680
Okay and then cholesterol test @@@.

DOCTOR Q680
Your cholesterol, your last cholesterol was in August so you'll be due.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah cause that was @@@.

DOCTOR Q680
@@@ this summer so we'll go ahead and order it for you.

PATIENT Q680
Okay.

DOCTOR Q680
And you can have that at your convenience and have you have to be fasting for that.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah uh-huh.  But they'll call me or do I have to call?

DOCTOR Q680
You can come any time to the Lab.

PATIENT Q680
Oh alright.

DOCTOR Q680
Any time at all.

PATIENT Q680
Okay, but I figured now that I'm off I'd have more time.

DOCTOR Q680
You have more free time sure yeah.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q680
At your convenience, you have to come in fasting.

PATIENT Q680
Okay.

DOCTOR Q680
When you get the labs drawn.

PATIENT Q680
So as long as I fast okay.

DOCTOR Q680
And then I can 92% of the time I'll give you a call back or @@@ will come to my in basket.  If you get @@@ who doesn't I might not know that you had it so, they usually always come back to my @@@. 

PATIENT Q680
Okay.

DOCTOR Q680
I'll give you a call if everything is okay.  So for your heart you're still taking the lisinopril 2.5, you're still taking the metoprolol 50 twice a day.

PATIENT Q680
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q680
Plavix and then aspirin right?

PATIENT Q680
Yeah, a baby aspirin.

DOCTOR Q680
A baby aspirin. Four drugs that we really, really need.  For your cholesterol you're taking three medications for your cholesterol.

PATIENT Q680
Right.

DOCTOR Q680
The niacin, the gemfibrozil and the simvastatin alright.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR Q680
@@@ and I'll take a look at you.

PATIENT Q680
Alright.  I just had a question on these dates here.  Just one week @@@.

DOCTOR Q680
Yes then you can follow up with her.

PATIENT Q680
@@@.

DOCTOR Q680
@@@.

PATIENT Q680
Oh okay.  Yeah because @@@ quite a while is @@@ for the next year is fine.

DOCTOR Q680
Alright.  Refill them all with one click there.

PATIENT Q680
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Q680
Um and then how's that groin pain?

PATIENT Q680
Uh I had that operation.

DOCTOR Q680
Good.

PATIENT Q680
And after that I was fine.

DOCTOR Q680
So you ended up having a hernia?

PATIENT Q680
I think yes, yeah mesh @@@.

DOCTOR Q680
Uh-huh good.

PATIENT Q680
And uh you know, several weeks of just taking it easy @@@ and then uh after about a month or more back to normal.

DOCTOR Q680
So, when was it, remember, the last time you described the exact symptoms of a hernia.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q680
But we didn't see it; it wasn't out when we saw it.  Did it come back?

PATIENT Q680
Yeah the pain was there.

DOCTOR Q680
Okay.

PATIENT Q680
It was always there and so.

DOCTOR Q680
Okay.

PATIENT Q680
One time I was lying there and then I, my wife she went to Walgreens, they gave her suggested these pants.

DOCTOR Q680
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q680
And that helped in the meantime until uh I had the operation.

DOCTOR Q680
Good.

PATIENT Q680
So I was wearing that every day, the hernia belt and I was wearing that every day until like several weeks later and I had the operation.

DOCTOR Q680
So when do you think you had the operation?

PATIENT Q680
Uh October.

DOCTOR Q680
October?  Good, good for you, well that's good.

PATIENT Q680
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q680
You sure sounded I mean @@@, you sounded exactly like you had a hernia but.

PATIENT Q680
Yes.

DOCTOR Q680
But it's very, but we didn't see it then.

PATIENT Q680
Hmm.  @@@.  But not as much.

DOCTOR Q680
Okay.

PATIENT Q680
Because I think at that time is when she got the belt.

DOCTOR Q680
Okay.

PATIENT Q680
The @@@.

DOCTOR Q680
And your heart stayed okay during the surgery, no problems?

PATIENT Q680
No problems.  @@@.  I am just slower now.

DOCTOR Q680
Yeah.

PATIENT Q680
@@@ but I still work out every day you know.

DOCTOR Q680
Great.

PATIENT Q680
I do cardio for about a half hour of cardio and then leg lifts and you know some days are easier, some days are longer you know.

DOCTOR Q680
Good.

PATIENT Q680
@@@ you know.

DOCTOR Q680
Well the only other thing that I see that I don't think that we talked about before is that you don't have diabetes based on what we have but your sugars are on the higher end of normal.

PATIENT Q680
Oh.

DOCTOR Q680
Okay.  Just one more thing to keep your eye on.  It's usually less than 100 for your fasting sugars @@@ and yours is 108.

PATIENT Q680
Oh.

DOCTOR Q680
If it was 176, you would be a diabetic.

PATIENT Q680
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Q680
So it's just something to keep an eye on.  You know, take out all the salt and the good fat @@@.

PATIENT Q680
@@@.

DOCTOR Q680
@@@ nothing but we still need to keep an eye on it.

PATIENT Q680
@@@.

DOCTOR Q680
Okay.

PATIENT Q680
So.

DOCTOR Q680
Diet if you can but @@@ um definitely you know and if you do develop diabetes it'll be very bad for your heart.

PATIENT Q680
Oh.

DOCTOR Q680
But it's something that for many reasons that obviously @@@ okay.

PATIENT Q680
Alright.

DOCTOR Q680
