DOCTOR R370
Um you know whether or not you need see the cardiologist today, that’s kind of up to debate. I'm kind of uneasy about um, about having you wait too long to see a cardiologist.

PATIENT R370
Okay.  That's why I have those notes from Holy Cross so you  really have something to really go on.

DOCTOR R370
Uh-huh.  Um any swelling in your legs?

PATIENT R370

PATIENT R370
2007, no it was about 2006.

DOCTOR R370
2006.  

PATIENT R370
Cause I went to Christ Hospital.

DOCTOR R370
Just trying to see what they were thinking.  @@@.

PATIENT R370
@@@ where they put that dye in and it make you feel all weird.

DOCTOR R370
That's um that's probably the CT that they did, then you go through the circle.

PATIENT R370
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R370
Yeah that's a CT.

PATIENT R370
No @@@ solution makes you feel real warm and I feel all crazy and weird like and they asked me I @@@ you know they put some more stuff and it's just like went away.  Makes my body real warm and then you got this you know.

PATIENT R370

PATIENT R370
That's what I'm telling you, you weren't listening DOCTOR.  I said it was at Holy Cross.

PATIENT R370
@@@ Something going on.

DOCTOR R370
@@@.  Oh now I'm picking it up.  Okay.  That is weird. With the swelling in your legs, it's a common practice to do an echo of the heart, because it’s one thing that could cause them to do an echo of your heart.  You could have swelling in your legs just because, also you had these DVTs in your legs.  Once you have a DVT if goes down into the veins of your legs and that kind of set it off.

PATIENT R370
Oh I think I can get a note for the other surgeries @@@ in Kentucky a venous @@@ or vein stripping.

Of my legs.

DOCTOR R370

SECOND DOCTOR R370
Blockage.

PATIENT R370
@@@ I had a heart attack.

SECOND DOCTOR R370
Right, right, and this was more of a blockage.  Um so we had no, I'm trying to figure out one option is that we could call the surgery fellow now.  We probably should @@@ surgery I mean the Cardiology fellow.  I think what we should do is call the Cardiology fellow now and ask them what they recommend we do cause I want to make sure we get this right.  You know on the one hand he knows his body well and he's saying that you know he's okay now.  On the other hand the problem is sometimes you know you can get a sudden blood clot in a narrow vessel and that can be deadly, like with no warning and we don't want that to happen to you.

PATIENT R370
Right I @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR R370
Well yeah kind of like an embolism or it could be just, an embolism or it could be just a piece of um tissue inside the artery basically just breaks away and can cause a blockage and that can happen in people with heart disease which is why sometimes people die suddenly.  Um it's unlikely to happen but um.

PATIENT R370
It can.

SECOND DOCTOR R370
It can and uh so I want to talk to the cardiologist today before and get his input. Do you want to page our fellow and get his input?

PATIENT R370
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR R370
We've got a pretty good idea, pretty good information now and we can say that you know he was initially treated for an MI in Springfield, that he was stented at that time.  He had a 99% lesion when he came in, he came back two weeks ago with a no MI at Holy Cross but with um evidence of you know some partial blockage um that now has been okay for a week, no symptoms um but uh we kind of want to get their advice of whether we need to do something today or whether we can have him come in for testing and also the question becomes, it would be nice to get the results from Holy Cross.  We're gonna want those results soon to get those sent over here and we could have him sign a release here.

PATIENT R370
I did that already.

SECOND DOCTOR R370
Oh good.

PATIENT R370
We did all that.  

FIRST DOCTOR R370
The pharmacist @@@

PATIENT R370
The forms, yeah I did all those things.  I @@@.  

SECOND DOCTOR R370
You had a heart attack you said in April?

PATIENT R370
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR R370

FIRST DOCTOR R370
Right, essentially you need to be on.

PATIENT R370
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR R370
Okay so we can also ask.  So why don't you call um, do you have another patient waiting or are you okay?

FIRST DOCTOR R370
No actually I think I'm okay.

SECOND DOCTOR R370
Good.  I want you to call the cardiologist.  So I want you to sit tight, let us call the cardiologist now and make sure we get this right.

PATIENT R370
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR R370

PATIENT R370

(DOCTOR OUT:  97:51  DOCTOR IN:  111:13)

FIRST DOCTOR R370
Hey how you doing.  Hi, so we talked to Cardiology.

PATIENT R370
Right.

FIRST DOCTOR R370
Talked to the Pharmacy.  Did a lot of talking.  So basically we're going to start you on two new meds. Number one is called Plavix.  Were you on Plavix for a month?

PATIENT R370
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR R370
Okay.  So but you have two stents, alright so you'll have a stent put over the other stent okay so the cardiologist thought that you should be on Plavix for longer. So we'll put you on Plavix until um until you can be seen.
 
PATIENT R370
And you want me on Plavix, @@@ injections and Coumadin.

FIRST DOCTOR R370
Yeah. But you know they work differently.  The Plavix works on platelets, the Coumadin kind of works on the blood, @@@ blood is.

PATIENT R370
@@@ injections work on what?.

FIRST DOCTOR R370
They work on helping your blood.  The Coumadin actually works on the same thing.

PATIENT R370
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR R370
So let's see.

PATIENT R370
So when do I have to come back.

FIRST DOCTOR R370
Uh we are trying to get you into Cardiology within the next week or two.

PATIENT R370
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR R370
And you're going to come to see me within a month.

PATIENT R370
Alright that'll be fine.  @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR R370
So @@@.  Alright you're gonna pick this up at the window.  It's uh and you're actually going to take once per day.  Uh the clopidogrel, the Plavix they're gonna contact you and give it to you well you can actually get it on Friday when you come to see the pharmacist okay.

PATIENT R370
Okay.  And the pharmacist. @@@

FIRST DOCTOR R370
On Friday yeah, @@@. You’re taking aspirin, right?

PATIENT R370
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR R370
Now one other thing is.

PATIENT R370
Well that medicine is one I will pick up today?

PATIENT R370

PATIENT R370
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR R370
If your chest pain would get any more frequent, if it starts happening when you're at rest, anything like that, you need to come in to the Emergency Room immediately.  Don't wait for it to be really bad. You know if it starts happening when you're at rest, when you're sitting down or something come in to the Emergency Room here okay.

PATIENT R370
