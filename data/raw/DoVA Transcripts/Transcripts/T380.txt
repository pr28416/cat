It's been over two years apparently since the last time they refilled it.

PATIENT T380
Yeah, they were uh extra-large.

DOCTOR T380
Okay.  

PATIENT T380
And could you get me uh, I don't know how they issue them now.  They used to issue them as two pairs but uh I feel with all the changing I have to do on that maybe four pairs would do for you know.

DOCTOR T380
@@@ let's try to split the middle and do three cause I know how they are on they’ll freak out.

PATIENT T380
Okay.

DOCTOR T380
Let's try three pairs of your size.

PATIENT T380
Alrighty.

DOCTOR T380
Now did you have an appointment with DOCTOR?

PATIENT T380
Right.

DOCTOR T380
Good.  I want you to get you back.

PATIENT T380
She won't be back for another couple of weeks I guess.

DOCTOR T380
Right.  Well hopefully it @@@ today; things like this on you will come up.

PATIENT T380
Right.

DOCTOR T380
So this is smart that you're here.  I think your leg looks better uh.  Let me take a listen to your lungs and see how you sound.  I'll have you lean forward for me.

PATIENT T380
Alrighty.

DOCTOR T380
Take a big deep breath.  Again.  Again.  Again.  Okay now relax and breathe normally.  Have you had problems breathing at all?

PATIENT T380
Not now.  I had the shortness of breath before coming to the hospital.

DOCTOR T380
Yes.  Are you taking the metoprolol every day?

PATIENT T380
Yes.  Everything that's on there that I need to have I'm following the regimen.

DOCTOR T380
Good, I'm just making sure.

PATIENT T380
Yeah.

DOCTOR T380
Okay.  So we got that, got that, got that.  The amlodipine.  Blood pressure looks fairly good today, you're afebrile, okay.  You need some refills.  Okay.  And I don't like your blood sugars where they are but we're gonna get a handle on those okay.

PATIENT T380
Okay.

DOCTOR T380
Alright.  I'm gonna come back, I'm going go @@@ my attending and we're gonna have to go up on the insulin regimen I imagine.

PATIENT T380
Alrighty.

DOCTOR T380
I'm not sure; um I'll be right back.

PATIENT T380
Alrighty.  I'll be right here.

DOCTOR T380
Be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  151:4  DOCTOR IN: 164:42)

DOCTOR T380
Okay.  I'm going over with my attending DOCTOR with regard to the level of your blood sugars; pretty carefully I'll grab that.

PATIENT T380
Okay.

DOCTOR T380
And uh you know I was going to be a little more aggressive.  I tend to agree with him, I think the key for you; we need to take one of them at a time and see what we go.  You that's what really happening and I don't want you to make you keep coming in and out um if we uh don't have to.  So why don't we um, why don't we go to 15 units on the insulin @@@, that's twice a day so your totals will be going up by 10 units right.  Its 5 extra in the morning, 5 extra at night, you follow?  So we want 15 twice a day on the regular insulin, keep the Lantus at 30 and then in four or five days if you're still high, give the Gen Med Clinic a call, say DOCTOR told me four days ago he wanted my blood sugar numbers, can I give them to you and you send them to DOCTOR, then they can write these down in the computer.

PATIENT T380
Okay.

DOCTOR T380
Send me a note, I call you and we can adjust them over the phone.

PATIENT T380
I see okay.

DOCTOR T380
Does that sound good to you?

PATIENT T380
Yes it does.

DOCTOR T380
That's for you.  We're gonna go up to 15.  You're gonna stop at the Lab on the way out.

PATIENT T380
And get my.

DOCTOR T380
And get your blood work done.

PATIENT T380
Blood work done.

DOCTOR T380
And that's all in the computer.

PATIENT T380
Will this also be sufficient for the blood work, Naw, I'm gonna have a fasting when I come and see DOCTOR right?

DOCTOR T380
Yeah.  I'm gonna let her, right cause you didn't fast today and she's going to want your cholesterol, but today we've just got to check your kidneys okay.  Cause as I say your kidneys aren't doing so hot.

PATIENT T380
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T380
And with your blood sugar the way it is, so we'll still have you and uh I'm going to change it in the computer.  You'll have to change it at home, @@@.

PATIENT T380
Yes, yes I do.

DOCTOR T380
You load it up, do you got enough?

PATIENT T380
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T380
I want to make sure you've got enough right here so I'm gonna change that to 15 units, that should be @@@.

PATIENT T380
You might have them send me another vial.

DOCTOR T380
Okay.  And I'm going to put lots of refills in here so.

PATIENT T380
Okay.

DOCTOR T380
So there are no issues okay.

PATIENT T380
Alrighty.

DOCTOR T380
And you can finish off the antibiotic and then.

PATIENT T380
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T380
You're good to go my fellow.  Uh and you have your appointment with DOCTOR already.

PATIENT T380
Oh yeah, should be in there.

DOCTOR T380
Take a look.

PATIENT T380
Sometime in the middle of January or February.  I think its January.

DOCTOR T380
So you can give this to them up front um when you check out.

PATIENT T380
Right.

DOCTOR T380
When you check out, we'll need to see if you uh, what the day is.  Your GMC3 DOCTOR.

PATIENT T380
What day was that.

DOCTOR T380
January 29th.

PATIENT T380
Uh February 29th?

DOCTOR T380
January 29th.

PATIENT T380
Oh January 29th.

DOCTOR T380
Have you seen her before?

PATIENT T380
No.

DOCTOR T380
I don't know why you have that appointment um.

PATIENT T380
I don’t either.  I've never heard that name before.

DOCTOR T380
Well, it might have been because they got that when they were trying to get my, before they tried to get my appointment.

PATIENT T380
I see.

DOCTOR T380
So why don't you try to re, so January 29th, DOCTOR, try to reschedule because you have a good relationship with DOCTOR right?

PATIENT T380
Yes.  She's taking real good care of me.

DOCTOR T380
No I can tell.  I can tell.  So why don't you try to get in to see her.

PATIENT T380
Okay.

DOCTOR T380
Next available.  That way you have an appointment and if you do you can get rid of this other appointment.  I think they just did that before they knew I'd see you.  I just added you on today.

PATIENT T380
Okay.

DOCTOR T380
Because I didn't want you to wait that long.

PATIENT T380
Plus they probably didn't know that DOCTOR would be back.

DOCTOR T380
Yes exactly.

PATIENT T380
In the clinic within.

DOCTOR T380
So try to get in.  And now I know, you're always welcome to see me.  I don't want to steal you from her.

PATIENT T380

DOCTOR T380
So we're just doing this to help you out.

PATIENT T380
Well thank you very much doc.

DOCTOR T380
