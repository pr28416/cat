PATIENT R210
Yes.

DOCTOR R210
Any pain in your legs when you're walking?

DOCTOR R210
It looks pretty good actually um but I think the foot doctor said they wanted to see you at some point so we'll go ahead and have them schedule you an appointment on your way out okay, can you do that?  Just to make sure.  I do want to talk to them and see if there are any other options okay.

PATIENT R210
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R210
Cause I know they want you on the boot but it's so hard to put on like you say I want to see if they have another solutions.

PATIENT R210
Yeah well the boot, I can't put it on by myself.

DOCTOR R210
Exactly, exactly so you know if you're not gonna do that what are the other options okay.  Other than giving you the right kind of padding in your shoes. Let’s see what else they have.  Did they say if there was anything else when you saw them at that time?

PATIENT R210
No.

DOCTOR R210
Cause I think you told them that you couldn't put it on the boot, right?

PATIENT R210
Right.

DOCTOR R210
Right okay.  

PATIENT R210
I don’t know what they were thinking about when they made those boots.

DOCTOR R210
Yeah right.  It should be something that makes it easier for you to put on and what not.  Let me take a listen to you.  Any cough or fevers, nothing like that right?

PATIENT R210
No.

DOCTOR R210
Okay.  Nice deep breath for me, in and out.  Good.  Breathe normal.  @@@.  The swelling is a little better than the last time when I saw you.

PATIENT R210

DOCTOR R210
And you’re on the 60 units right?

PATIENT R210

DOCTOR R210
Okay.  So the insulin, it does say 7 units before breakfast, lunch and dinner but you have to take it as before you eat okay.

PATIENT R210
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R210
Cause I know you normally eat two meals a day @@@ you don’t eat as much @@@ keep that two.

PATIENT R210

PATIENT R210
Yeah.

DOCTOR R210
Okay.  Both of them?

PATIENT R210
Probably just one.

DOCTOR R210
The @@@ one?  With uh, everybody under 65, which you aren’t, um we recommend it getting because of your diabetes and stuff, you'd be at a high risk, you know if you do get it.  

PATIENT R210
Yeah.

DOCTOR R210

DOCTOR R210
Yeah they'll give you the swine flu shot too.

PATIENT R210
Okay.

DOCTOR R210
Um so reactions, people’s allergic reactions, the same as @@@ have the flu shot @@@ so the only reason @@@ allergic to eggs or something like that.  If you're able to @@@ I don't expect you’ll have any reactions @@@.

(DOCTOR OUT:  50:02  DOCTOR IN:  53:24)

DOCTOR R210
Okay.  So let's look at @@@ what other options there are if it's not the boot.

PATIENT R210
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R210
They said sometimes it can have like with a cast or something similar to that, where it would keep the weight off the foot and the ulcer @@@ because we don't want it turning into something else okay.  And the problem with having that kind of you know ulcer on the foot problems down here @@@.

PATIENT R210
Yeah.

DOCTOR R210
@@@ worry about the healing and the situation and things like that and um you know diabetes makes it a bit hard for heal wounds and things like that in the feet and the fingers and so um what I'd like to do is we’ll get you an appointment back in the foot clinic and we'll see what else they can do for you okay.  Cause we've got to keep the weight off.  I don't want it turning into this big fat ugly thing that, you know that requires potentially cutting it off and getting rid of it, we don’t want that, okay.

PATIENT R210
Yeah.

DOCTOR R210
Alright so we'll send you back to them and I'll see you again in three weeks okay.

PATIENT R210
Alright.

DOCTOR R210
They can actually make that appointment out front.  And I just want to make sure that this is the correct number to reach you at NUMBER?

PATIENT R210
Yeah.

DOCTOR R210
Um if there’s an answering  machine or something like that.  @@@ get the lab if you wanted @@@ or we need to make adjustments to anything I'll give you a call; otherwise you know it will take about a week for everything to come back, if you don't hear from me then everything is good.

PATIENT R210
Yeah.

DOCTOR R210
Does that sound like a plan?

PATIENT R210
