DOCTOR H772
Do you have a home nurse?

PATIENT H772

DOCTOR H772

DOCTOR H772
Yeah that's right.  It's really up.

PATIENT H772
The doctor gave me that one pill and told me to cut it in half, that's stupid because the pill cutter can’t @@@ little pill and cut a little pill. If I'm gonna cut it in half.  That thing won't cut right.  And the Lasix @@@.


DOCTOR H772
Which one?

PATIENT H772
The cholesterol.

DOCTOR H772
I can change that.

DOCTOR H772
@@@ can’t cut it in half.

DOCTOR H772
So when was the last time you took Lasix, this morning?

PATIENT H772
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H772
Oh so you just ran out.

PATIENT H772
Yeah.

DOCTOR H772
Oh that's good time then alright.  We'll get you a refill.  And then as far as the blood pressure goes we'll have to increase your pill called Losartan.

PATIENT H772
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H772
We can go up on that okay.

PATIENT H772
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H772
How long were in you Jackson Park?

PATIENT H772
A week.

DOCTOR H772
A week.

PATIENT H772
We @@@.

DOCTOR H772
Feeling better since then?

PATIENT H772
No really.  Slowly @@@ tired.

DOCTOR H772
@@@.  

PATIENT H772
I got to lose some weight.  I have to lose weight @@@ before I.

DOCTOR H772
We have a program here.

PATIENT H772
I got to be 295 @@@.

DOCTOR H772
And I think that's probably why you're getting back pain.  @@@ the joints in your back and your knees and muscles you put a lot of strain on them with the weight.  There's a program to help you.  It's called the MOVE Program, you heard of it?

PATIENT H772
Uh uh.

DOCTOR H772
It's basically to help you with nutrition, helps you with exercise.  We have a gym here and we have some like recreation stuff you can use.

PATIENT H772
@@@ can’t get here. 

DOCTOR H772
How'd get rid of that?

PATIENT H772
@@@ get paid for something.

DOCTOR H772
Okay.  Um it should right, if they arrange for that or not but I think it'd be a good thing for you.  You know this weight is only going to make the heart failure worse too so.  It's gonna be difficult to keep that blood pressure under control and when the blood pressure gets out of control then the heart has more strain.  I think dealing with the weight is gonna be just as important as dealing with all these other little personal things you deal with.

PATIENT H772
Yeah.

DOCTOR H772
So you have an appointment with the pharmacist today um.

PATIENT H772
Well I'll be meeting @@@.

DOCTOR H772
And it says here you have it from 1-2 o'clock.  In the meantime I'll have you go to the Pharmacy and pick up your Lasix and your simvastatin okay and we'll have you pick up some more of the Losartan for your high blood pressure.  Do you have a heating pack at home for that back?

PATIENT H772
Uh uh.

DOCTOR H772
No.  Heat works really well for those types of muscle things.  Um I don't want to give you any ibuprofen.

PATIENT H772
I generally take Aleve.

DOCTOR H772
Yeah.  Uh you've got some Tylenol @@@ that you can try. Can you take a deep breath for me?

PATIENT H772
@@@@  I got upset when I couldn't button these pants.  @@@.

DOCTOR H772
Why do you think you gained weight?

PATIENT H772
@@@  So any it's getting hard to fluctuate @@@ move.  I @@@ lay in the bed.

DOCTOR H772
Uh-huh. Swelling is okay. Is this usually how it is?

PATIENT H772
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H772
@@@ too much fluid.  Have you had to sleep on pillows at night, to be able to breathe?

PATIENT H772
I sleep @@@ every night.

DOCTOR H772
@@@ okay, four pillows @@@.  Are you coughing anything up still?

PATIENT H772
Uh uh.

DOCTOR H772
No okay.  Any fevers or chills recently?

PATIENT H772
Uh uh.

DOCTOR H772
Okay um.  Let me talks to DOCTOR about getting you transportation to the MOVE Program.  We'll get your prescriptions and uh and then you know I would try a heat pack at night.  At Walgreens they have ones that you can plug in.  They have ones that you put in the microwave.  They've got a whole bunch of different kinds that you can try on that area.  Where is it exactly?

PATIENT H772
Right here.

DOCTOR H772
What I would do is if you can, when you're lying in bed either every morning or if you're sitting in the chair later in the evening, put a heat pack on that area.

PATIENT H772
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H772
Okay.  Um and the heat will help kind of penetrate the muscle.

PATIENT H772
@@@ last week.  She said my home didn't get enough heat.

DOCTOR H772
Okay.

PATIENT H772

DOCTOR H772

PATIENT H772
