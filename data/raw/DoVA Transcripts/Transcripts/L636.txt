Okay.

PATIENT L636
And I brought the medicine - Valium.

DOCTOR L636
Did you try the Valium?

PATIENT L636
No I didn't take it cause I couldn't even get in there.  I had a cold now.  I've got a cold now and that's the biggest problem I have when I'm laying down, due to my back or it's the postnasal drip and it makes me gag.

DOCTOR L636
Okay.

PATIENT L636
And that's my nightmare yeah.  And I'm sorry but you know.

DOCTOR L636
No and so we'll do something.  We'll figure this out.

PATIENT L636
Okay.  I brought you back the pill too cause I didn't take it.  I don't know if they want it, so I probably should give it back to the pharmacy or.

DOCTOR L636
Um yeah I can do that.

PATIENT L636
Oh good, okay.  Yeah I bet they can use it.  I didn't even open it doc you know.

DOCTOR L636
@@@ okay.  But you got a cold @@@?

PATIENT L636
Yeah, yeah I've got a cold for a couple weeks now and um yeah.  You know cold sneezes so that and um my biggest problem lately is I uh fell out of bed twice in the last month and last night, night before last I fell out of the bed, a queen-sized bed and uh I sat up and my daughter's telling me that cause she is in the living room and I sat up and as soon as I sat up, I went right out of the bed in between the dresser and the night stand right.  Blasted my arm you know.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
I blastered the arm real good and I bump my head on the dresser and I didn't pass out but I was soaking wet with sweat and the last time I had that happen to me, Stuckie woke me up because I was having a nightmare and I was holding my breath again and uh she went to shake me to wake me up and I jumped out of bed and fell right down again.  So I'm having that fall thing going on.

DOCTOR L636
How often are you waking up at night?

PATIENT L636
A lot.

DOCTOR L636
At nighttime?

PATIENT L636
Yes, the medicine I'm getting ain't helping me.  You know I had a real bad one you know.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
A couple real scary ones.

DOCTOR L636
Okay.

PATIENT L636
They don't scare me as much as they scare my wife and my daughter you know.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
Cause I look like kind of a mad man.  My daughter said you look like a mad man this morning you know.  My eyes are this big you know.  You know I'm embarrassed because she came in, she seen me with the diaper on and you know.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
She's 17 you know I.  We don't even tell the kids I put them on you know.

DOCTOR L636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L636
But I had that on and that's been a real bummer too.  The wetting the bed and the constipation God I got some stuff, what do you call it, the enemas you know the liquid enemas that come in a squeeze bottle, she had to go out yesterday and get me that because I couldn't make it go and then that helped it like a great deal but then I'm bleeding.

DOCTOR L636
You're having bleeding?

PATIENT L636
My hemorrhoids.

DOCTOR L636
Oh okay.

PATIENT L636
I was bleeding like a dog and uh it was terrible so.  Yeah I think I'm taking so much medicines I just think that's adding to it.  But I am putting weight back on.  I go to my cardiac exercise and now I'm on the next 12 week thing.

DOCTOR L636
Well good.

PATIENT L636
I got my 70% from the VA on my pension.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
But they rated me 70% so I'm going to file the appeal and get the other 30 cause they said the only thing that they were lacking was being able to substantiate that I'm unemployable.  Well I'm on Social Security for being unemployable and disabled and I been telling the nurse that I'm unemployable by the psychiatrist DOCTOR and by another doctor here but they said they have to have more evidence so I don't know what evidence they need.

DOCTOR L636
When was the last time you saw DOCTOR?

PATIENT L636
Oh I seen him about two weeks ago I think.  I think I have to see him this week coming.

DOCTOR L636
Okay, okay.  Do you talk about @@@ nighttime?

PATIENT L636
Yeah.

DOCTOR L636
Do @@@ helping at all?

PATIENT L636
No, really I mean.  He got me on this medication and you know, like I'll tell him I'm falling out of bed and he'll tell me well move the night stand and throw a couple comforters down on the floor next to your bed, so we do that.  So I @@@ it's insane.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
You know its insane man.  So the heart, the surgery, it’s good.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
I @@@ neck and low back you know.  But uh that was tough because of the loss of weight you know.  Cause I've lost a lot of weight and I look like it too.

DOCTOR L636
You look better than when I saw you last.

PATIENT L636
Yeah.

DOCTOR L636
@@@.

PATIENT L636
Yeah I've done good now you know.  I'm starting to, you know put on the weight now.  I'm about 164, 165.

DOCTOR L636
Hmm.

PATIENT L636
But I'm working out so.  At the Cardiac Rehab.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
But I'm just beside myself about this waking up at night you know and wetting the bed and you know and not having any control over these nightmares you know.

DOCTOR L636
Okay.  They say wetting the bed @@@ through the diapers?

PATIENT L636
Yeah.

DOCTOR L636
Okay.  

PATIENT L636
And I slowed down on drinking.  My wife tells me no you can't do that, you'll screw your kidneys up and.

DOCTOR L636
@@@ slow down drinking water?

PATIENT L636
Water, yeah.

DOCTOR L636
@@@ alcohol?

PATIENT L636
No, no, no. I had a couple drinks last month and I got uh some medicine from the psychiatrist to take if I feel like I'm going to start having a problem.  I can't think of the name of it now.  Uh, Antabuse.

DOCTOR L636
It's Antabuse yeah.

PATIENT L636
Yeah so.  But I was really depressed after a while.  My dad's funeral.

DOCTOR L636
Are you having neck pain?

PATIENT L636
Yeah I'm having some neck pain, back of my neck.  When I wake up in the mornings uh cause that's what I do is I try to sleep high.

DOCTOR L636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L636
And when I’m sleeping high I'm doing this at night and I wake up with a really pounding headache and uh I don't think it's anything to do with any damage from my body just the way that I sleep and uh that's about it.

DOCTOR L636
Okay.

PATIENT L636
Of course I'm making my wife crazy cause she's watching me now.  I went for the sleep apnea test.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
And the nurse told me I held my breath three times during the evening.

DOCTOR L636
Okay.

PATIENT L636
Well she said one of them was 40 seconds long.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
Then they woke me up about 10 to 5 on that one.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
And they tried to give me that little mask that you wear.

DOCTOR L636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L636
I couldn't wear it.

DOCTOR L636
@@@.

PATIENT L636
Neither one.

DOCTOR L636
Oh.

PATIENT L636
So then they let me go home and she says DOCTOR will call me and let me know about that.  I hadn't heard from DOCTOR.  Maybe she went on vacation or something.  That Korean doctor so.

DOCTOR L636
Okay.

PATIENT L636
Yeah so I don't know if we need a follow up on that.  @@@ thing is I even hold my breath during the day she notices.  I don't know what that's from.  Your guess is as good as mine.

DOCTOR L636
Well, it's @@@ sleep apnea.

PATIENT L636
Yeah.

DOCTOR L636
Um @@@ works as @@@.

PATIENT L636
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR L636
But for people like, like you and me and I have it as well.

PATIENT L636
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR L636
And uh I don't know why.

PATIENT L636
Yeah.  Okay.

DOCTOR L636
@@@.

PATIENT L636
It's not gonna kill you, let's put it that way.

DOCTOR L636
Well you know, the problem is that holding your breath while you sleep and struggling against holding your breath.

PATIENT L636
Yeah.

DOCTOR L636
It can put a strain on your heart and your lungs.

PATIENT L636
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR L636
Because you're creating high pressure inside your chest.

PATIENT L636
Yeah.

DOCTOR L636
And that straining can cause some damage.

PATIENT L636
It does.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah to the heart.

PATIENT L636
Could it have cause that tumor?

DOCTOR L636
It wouldn't cause a tumor but it can weaken the heart.

PATIENT L636
Okay.

DOCTOR L636
Quite a bit.

PATIENT L636
Then I got to do something about that then.

DOCTOR L636
So part of it is finding a CPAP machine that you like.

PATIENT L636
Yeah.

DOCTOR L636
Sort of finding a position where you sleep and don't hold your breath.  Are you going to see the pulmonologist again, have they reviewed that sleep study?

PATIENT L636
I hope so.  I don't know, who's it gonna be?

DOCTOR L636
There's one um. (Looks in EMR)

PATIENT L636
Cause I want to get this taken care of cause I you know my heart took a beating with that surgery you know.  I ended up with a bad heart you know.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.  So it said the test will be read by DOCTOR by @@@.  

PATIENT L636
It’s Friday.

DOCTOR L636
Hmm.  You may need to give DOCTOR a call.

PATIENT L636
Yeah okay.  Do you have a direct line to her? Where is she at, what medicine?

DOCTOR L636
She's uh; She's in pulmonology.  @@@  You could call the main line and ask for the Sleep Clinic.

PATIENT L636
Okay.  Yeah.  What floor was that on 11 or something like that?  I don't even remember when I went up there.  I think it was up there, 14, 11, I don't know.

DOCTOR L636
@@@ to get it.  Alright.

PATIENT L636
Yeah.

DOCTOR L636
Still something to get.  So you had an MRI in the past.  How did you get through the MRI?

PATIENT L636
Well I didn't have this thing because I took the medication for a couple days before that and it wasn't a long trip into that machine.  It was kind of fast.  I think I was in there maybe 15 minutes if that but I know I wanted to come out of there every second I was in there you know.  I just told myself to stay there and get this done.  But it's a real bummer for me.  You know I can't stand being in there.  @@@ not good.  You know not good.  And I feel like the guy can't hear me you know.

DOCTOR L636
Yeah.

PATIENT L636
And I'm scared of it you know.  Not to be a sissy about it,

DOCTOR L636
@@@.

PATIENT L636
It scared the shit out of me.

DOCTOR L636
@@@.

PATIENT L636
You know.  I been in a couple situations where I was in that @@@, it was like so if we can do the same thing that SCT scan will give you, you know if that'll work or if you could knock me out.

DOCTOR L636

PATIENT L636
Okay.  What's the MRI going to be looking for?

DOCTOR L636
So on the CT or sorry @@@ so you had the MRI.  The MRI showed a mass in one of the vertebrae of your neck.

PATIENT L636
Okay.

DOCTOR L636
That might be causing the pain.

PATIENT L636
Okay.

DOCTOR L636
And I'm not sure exactly what the mass is or what to do about it.

PATIENT L636
Okay.

DOCTOR L636
Um and we want to take a better look at it and make sure that one it's nothing dangerous.

PATIENT L636
Okay.

DOCTOR L636
And two that uh see that if it's causing the neck pain then we can get it fixed.

PATIENT L636
Right.

DOCTOR L636
So, I don't know.  With the history of the prostate cancer, we can never be too careful.

PATIENT L636
Right.

DOCTOR L636

PATIENT L636
Well before I had the surgery they pulled a tooth you know.  Cause now I got one that's bothering but I'm not able to chew my food thoroughly.

PATIENT L636
No they didn't do a colonoscopy.  I thought they were going to do a lower GI or something, what is that?

DOCTOR L636
That's the same thing.  

PATIENT L636
What's a lower GI?  Is that when they put all that barium in you?

DOCTOR L636
Uh sort a yeah.

PATIENT L636
That milky stuff, that white stuff?

DOCTOR L636
@@@.

PATIENT L636
O brother.  I don't know what they want but I thought she had said the lower GI.  I don't need that, I had one of those many years ago and.

DOCTOR L636
If you can get the GI consult, you need to get the labs drawn.

PATIENT L636

PATIENT L636
Where do you get that?

DOCTOR L636
Very low @@@.  Your hemoglobin A1c is normal, 6.3 moderately high so, let's do that again.  @@@ is normal.  All of your blood counts look just fine.  You're a little anemic.

PATIENT L636
What does that mean?

DOCTOR L636
That means uh that you have low red blood cells.  That's probably another reason why we need a colonoscopy.

PATIENT L636
Gotcha.

DOCTOR L636
It could be blood loss and otherwise looks pretty good and then your electrolytes and cholesterol are pretty good.  Actually fantastic.  You got great cholesterol.

PATIENT L636
