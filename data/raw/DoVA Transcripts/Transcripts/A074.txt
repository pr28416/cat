Well tell me about the urinating, what's going on with that?

PATIENT A074
Yeah well uh I stopped taking, I stopped taking the terazosin.

DOCTOR A074
Why?

PATIENT A074
Because I thought it was affecting my urine.  My urine pattern.  So when I stopped taking terazosin my urine got worse but I didn't take the terazosin because I thought the terazosin was causing me to get up three times a night.

DOCTOR A074
It should be causing you to get up less and maybe letting you get up three instead of six.

PATIENT A074
Oh yeah?

DOCTOR A074
When did you stop it?

PATIENT A074
I stopped it maybe about a month ago.
