@@@ I think you're supposed to be my 3:30 but if you want to go early.  Okay.  We just kind of have to be a little quicker so in case the 1:30 shows up, so we can get them in okay.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
Unless you want to wait.

PATIENT Z541
No that's fine.

DOCTOR Z541
You'd rather come in?

PATIENT Z541
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR Z541
Okay, come on in.  I'm DOCTOR and I think you already have a doctor.  I think DOCTOR is your doctor right?

PATIENT Z541
I'm not sure.  

DOCTOR Z541
He saw you in March.

PATIENT Z541
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR Z541
Yeah.  So what brings you in today?

PATIENT Z541
Uh I had an appointment to see the doctor and I wanted to know when it would be possible to get into a group.

DOCTOR Z541
What kind of group?

PATIENT Z541
Uh.

DOCTOR Z541
Why don’t you come over here, we can talk and I can go through your chart up at the same time.  Okay. What kind of group?

PATIENT Z541
You know any kind of group where you sit down and start saying things.

DOCTOR Z541
Like a mental health group or?

PATIENT Z541
@@@.

DOCTOR Z541
What's bothering you?

PATIENT Z541
Oh, uh it's hard for me to sustain reality from fiction.

DOCTOR Z541
Give me an example.

PATIENT Z541
I keep seeing monsters and seeing people dying.

DOCTOR Z541
But it's not real as far as you know?

PATIENT Z541
I could tell just by @@@.

DOCTOR Z541
So you feel like you're kind of seeing the future?  When did this start?

PATIENT Z541
Since 71.

DOCTOR Z541
So you're kind of seeing into the future.

PATIENT Z541
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR Z541
Okay.  What's your past medical history?  What else do you have wrong?

PATIENT Z541
My legs.I need an operation on my leg.

DOCTOR Z541
Do you have heart disease?

PATIENT Z541
I had three stents put in.

DOCTOR Z541
When was that?

PATIENT Z541
Just about two months ago.

DOCTOR Z541
Okay.  What else?

PATIENT Z541
They had to operate on my eye too.

DOCTOR Z541
DOCTOR know you've had some heart disease um, he talked about where do you have screws in your, in your leg?

PATIENT Z541
Right here, right here.

DOCTOR Z541
So in the right knee, you had a right knee surgery and that's all really.  You don't have too much going on, in terms of chronic medical things.

PATIENT Z541
And it's hard for me to sleep.

DOCTOR Z541
Okay.  Do you see a psychiatrist?

PATIENT Z541
Yes ma'am, I just started coming here.

DOCTOR Z541
Okay they just saw you on June 30th and you told them, are you taking the sleeping pill they gave you?

PATIENT Z541
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR Z541
Are you taking the olanzapine and sertraline?

PATIENT Z541
Yes.

DOCTOR Z541
And is that helping these symptoms?

PATIENT Z541
No.

DOCTOR Z541
We might just have to send you back to the Mental Health Center.  You know you have this condition which is atypical psychosis.

PATIENT Z541
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR Z541
You know that's what those medications are for.

PATIENT Z541
I see.

DOCTOR Z541
But if they're not controlling your symptoms then you probably need those medications to be changed.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.  I understand.  Could you make them a little stronger so I can rest?

DOCTOR Z541
I can't, but we're going to send you to them.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
Hopefully today.  Hold on just a second.  The other question I had, I'm looking at your Mental Health Note from June 30th and they said that they gave you an appointment to come and see me um because you were having a cough and nasal congestion.  Are you still having that?

PATIENT Z541
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR Z541
Well why don't we take care of that problem since you're here.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
And then I'll call over to Mental Health and see if we can follow up over there today.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
Okay.  Tell me about the cough.

PATIENT Z541
Oh, it's hard for me to oh, my throat is sore.

DOCTOR Z541

PATIENT Z541

DOCTOR Z541
Do you have any other complaints today or just the initial complaint?

PATIENT Z541

DOCTOR Z541
Okay did you try that medicine they gave you?

PATIENT Z541
I didn't do no good.

DOCTOR Z541
Let me see if I have the number for Mental Health?  Let me see if this is the number.  Do you think you'd like to go over there and see somebody so they could change your medicines?

PATIENT Z541
If you send me, I'll go.

DOCTOR Z541
Let me call them.  I don't know if this is the right number, but we'll try.  I'm looking at your meds now and you know.  Did you try the cough syrup they gave you?

PATIENT Z541
Yes.

DOCTOR Z541
Did it help?

PATIENT Z541
No, no.

DOCTOR Z541
Any of @@@ here?

(Doctor made phone call in the room with patient)

DOCTOR Z541
You’re already on all the treatment.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
For the cough, you know how you take this omeprazole medicine, do you know that one? (answers the phone) They’ll see you right when we’re done.

PATIENT Z541
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z541
So the omeprazole you can take maybe at nighttime instead of in the morning and maybe that'll help your cough.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
You sound like you're laying down and maybe you're getting acid reflux.

PATIENT Z541
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z541
So maybe we should change that medicine to twice a day.  You take it in the morning and at night.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
And hopefully that'll help your cough.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
So that sounds good?

PATIENT Z541
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z541
I'm going to take a listen though and make sure your lungs sound good and then we'll get you on your way and I can have you take that medicine twice a day.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
Here have a seat over here.  Do you know where the Intake Center is on the first floor of Building 228?

PATIENT Z541
Uh, I’ll find it. I don’t know where it is, but I’ll find it.

DOCTOR Z541
Do you know where 228 is, the Mental Health Building?

PATIENT Z541
@@@ where I just come from?

DOCTOR Z541
Yes.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
And then you go to where it says Intake.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
Um you're not having any voices telling you to hurt yourself or anything?

PATIENT Z541
Yesterday I did.

DOCTOR Z541
You did?

PATIENT Z541
Weird sounds and I have been getting @@@.

DOCTOR Z541
Do you think you need to go to the Emergency Room instead or would you rather try going.  Have you ever had that happen to you before?

PATIENT Z541
Twice before.

DOCTOR Z541
What happened then, did you just go to Mental Health?

PATIENT Z541
Uh-huh yeah.

DOCTOR Z541
And they helped you with your medicines?

PATIENT Z541
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z541
Okay.  So I'm going to take a quick listen okay.  Take a deep breath.  Have you ever used an inhaler?

PATIENT Z541
Uh yes.

DOCTOR Z541
Do you want to try one now to help your cough?

PATIENT Z541
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR Z541
And do you want me to mail it to you or do you want to pick them up?

PATIENT Z541
Probably pick them up.

DOCTOR Z541
Okay.  Now this medicine, you can take two puffs, so two inhales um every six hours as you need it okay.

PATIENT Z541
Alright.

DOCTOR Z541
So see if it helps.  Now real quick, let me just look through here.  So what exactly are the voices telling you to do?

PATIENT Z541
Crying out to me for help.

DOCTOR Z541
Okay and how are they telling you to hurt yourself?  What do they say?

PATIENT Z541
I can do better than what I'm doing @@@.

DOCTOR Z541
They want your help, okay.  You need to feel better than this right?  So I think this is probably the best option to go to the first floor, 228.

PATIENT Z541
228.

DOCTOR Z541
I wrote it on here for you.  Um.  So and you're going to Building 228 first floor Mental Health Intake.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
Okay so maybe if you get lost you can ask someone, you know Building 228.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541
It's like that way.

PATIENT Z541
Alright.

DOCTOR Z541
You go to the first floor and then instead of going out the front you kind of walk to the other building right?

PATIENT Z541
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR Z541
So I'll be right back but here's this that you'll need.  I'll be right back you stay here for a minute.

PATIENT Z541
Okay.

DOCTOR Z541

PATIENT Z541

(DOCTOR OUT:  50:12  DOCTOR IN:  56:55

DOCTOR Z541
Alright come on.  We got someone to walk you over so you won't get lost.

PATIENT Z541
@@@.

DOCTOR Z541
I was worried because I'm not exactly sure where the desk is either so, we might as well send someone who knows exactly where you're going.

PATIENT Z541
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR Z541
@@@.  You got a lot of fun stuff here.  So it's nice to meet you.

PATIENT Z541
