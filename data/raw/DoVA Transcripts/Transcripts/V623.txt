DOCTOR PERSON V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
@@@@ A friend of ours is a rep for . . .

DOCTOR V623
@@@ uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
Carvedilol or Coreg.  And they were told that it does damage to warn people that it could have the same effects of a statin for leaking into the muscle.

DOCTOR V623
Yes.

SECOND PERSON V623
And so we have, when he first started taking it and they took him off it for a while and then this last time his primary put him on it, well anyay.

DOCTOR V623
So.  Now let's go through and see what he's on.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON V623
Yeah.  You know what I have a handwritten list.

DOCTOR V623
Okay good.

SECOND PERSON V623
Uh I did check that list and there are a few omissions that I want to make sure that I didn't.

DOCTOR V623
So you actually, you broke your hip when you saw her.

PATIENT V623
Yep.

DOCTOR V623
Which hip was it?

PATIENT V623
Both of them, I mean.  I fell and I broke one and then I fell again and I broke it.

SECOND PERSON V623
July and you broke your left hip and in December he broke his right.

DOCTOR V623
So what are they doing about the falls?

PATIENT V623
@@@.

DOCTOR V623
What are we doing to prevent the falls.  Are you now completely in a wheelchair?

PATIENT V623
Well yeah.  I use a walker and they put weights on it, which helps me a lot.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  Are you taking physical therapy?

PATIENT V623

DOCTOR V623
Okay good.

PATIENT V623
So you know.  I'm much better you know.

DOCTOR V623

PATIENT V623
I'm more comfortable you know walking with it because it doesn't wobble.

DOCTOR V623
Good.

PATIENT V623
Both of us waddling.

DOCTOR V623
And then going to the bathroom, did you set up things in the bathrooms, sometimes people use stuff like that.

PATIENT V623
@@@.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  No don't worry about it, I'll check it.

PATIENT V623

SECOND PERSON V623

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  So the carvedilol, oh @@@.  You want to have a seat?

SECOND PERSON V623
No it's okay.  It's all good.

DOCTOR V623
Are you okay?  The carvedilol D 0.1, @@@ the same right.

SECOND PERSON V623

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
Twice a day.

DOCTOR V623
Okay twice a day?

SECOND PERSON V623

DOCTOR V623
It says every day here so I will change it to twice a day.

SECOND PERSON V623
Huh?

DOCTOR V623
Twice a day. And then the insulin, are you still on insulin?

SECOND PERSON V623
Yeah, the Novolog.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

SECOND PERSON V623

DOCTOR V623

DOCTOR V623
Okay that's fine.

SECOND PERSON V623
That's fine.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  Um so he's taking a multivitamin.

SECOND PERSON V623
Yes and for some reason, it didn't come.  I called DOCTOR.

DOCTOR V623

SECOND PERSON V623

DOCTOR V623
So we got to order it.

SECOND PERSON V623
Okay.

DOCTOR V623
Omeprazole.

SECOND PERSON V623
Yeah.  I called on June 12th and they said he couldn't order any more until September.

DOCTOR V623
I’ll order it @@@.  So terimosin@@@ is he still taking that.  It says on here 2mg twice a day is just fine.

SECOND PERSON V623
That seems to be helping

DOCTOR V623
So two of them. He takes two of them twice a day right?  Okay good.  Uh okay this is @@@ Coumadin or Warfarin @@@.

SECOND PERSON V623
Yes, yes and I asked them @@@ ahead @@@ hold @@@ because she wanted to have people on Coumadin rather than on @@@ but it’s not on @@@

DOCTOR V623
Because it also looks like he was taken off of it.  From what I I was reading in his notes, he was off of it at one time.  I'm not sure if it was after the fall maybe.

SECOND PERSON V623
Oh he was off of it; he went off of it when he had surgery maybe yeah.

DOCTOR V623
Okay, okay, so I'll put that back on.  How much does he take now?

SECOND PERSON V623

DOCTOR V623

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

SECOND PERSON V623

SECOND PERSON V623
One he takes on the day for dialysis.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
And then the non-dialysis days @@@.

DOCTOR V623
@@@ I'll order today and @@@ 4 mg.

SECOND PERSON V623
@@@.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  And then @@@ amiodarone.  @@@ 20 mg once a day.

SECOND PERSON V623
Yeah that was one of the things that we needed a new prescription for.

DOCTOR V623
Okay, uh so if he needs @@@ today does he need to go to the Pharmacy today or can things be sent to the house.

SECOND PERSON V623
@@@ sent to the house.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

SECOND PERSON V623
@@@  okay good.

DOCTOR V623
Otherwise.

SECOND PERSON V623
Is there anything that you need?

PATIENT V623
No.

SECOND PERSON V623
@@@.

DOCTOR V623
Okay, okay.  So let's see.

SECOND PERSON V623
Don't you think we were well-organized this time?

DOCTOR V623
Okay let's see.  Okay now.

SECOND PERSON V623
Now you can handle the rest of it.  I do the accounting.

DOCTOR V623
And you're back on dialysis?

PATIENT V623
Pardon me?

DOCTOR V623
You're back on dialysis?

PATIENT V623
Uh yes.  Uh Wednesday and Saturday, two times a week.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

SECOND PERSON V623
He's having some problems with the Saturday one.  He's always sick on Sunday and so they cut him back this last Saturday right?

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
And he seemed to be a little better.  

DOCTOR V623
How many times therapy comes to the house? Home many times a week?

PATIENT V623
I do therapy at home anymore.

DOCTOR V623
Do you go somewhere for therapy.

PATIENT V623
I go to Oak Park Hospital.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  How many times a week?

PATIENT V623
Uh twice a week.

SECOND PERSON V623
Two to three times, it kind of depends.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  Well let's see.  No chest pain, shortness of breath, nothing like that?

PATIENT V623
No.

DOCTOR V623
Good.  Um now the last time you saw the urologist, you did a urine test which came back positive.  He had some; did they ever give you antibiotics for that?

PATIENT V623
Uh, you know what.

SECOND PERSON V623
We, she sent the report.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

SECOND PERSON V623
To his primary in Oak Park because @@@ because the last time that he was in the hospital.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
They said he is carrying a chronic bacteria.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

SECOND PERSON V623
In his bladder.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

SECOND PERSON V623
And that it cannot be treated by oral antibiotics.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

SECOND PERSON V623
And uh he's just going to have to live with it kind of and that occasionally it will cause symptoms.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

SECOND PERSON V623
If the symptoms are not, if they're not tolerable I don't know, uh then he would, PATIENT would go have to go into the hospital and have an IV antibiotic and he did have a temp the night before he came out here.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
And also he was kind of @@@ too I think that night.  He had chills or something, @@@.  But uh then he seemed to get over it.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  You don't have a Foley catheter do you?

PATIENT V623
Yeah they did one the last time uh-huh.  I don't know if I still have @@@.

SECOND PERSON V623
No a Foley catheter.  No, no.

PATIENT V623
Oh, sorry.

SECOND PERSON V623
No.

PATIENT V623
That's something different.

DOCTOR V623
When you do urinate, there is no pain, no burning with urination?

PATIENT V623
No.

DOCTOR V623
Right okay well again that's the reason why @@@ can have these symptoms and you know I treat the patient, not the lab draw. @@@  And blood pressures at home, how have they been?  Blood pressure checks he takes at home?

PATIENT V623
Uh I haven't taken it and I don't know why.  Yeah you know it's controlled and I guess that's why I got off of you know taking it every day at home.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  That's fine.

SECOND PERSON V623
@@@ I suppose we should do that.  We used to do that all the time.

PATIENT V623
Yeah @@@.

SECOND PERSON V623
Well @@@.  It kind of got dropped by the way side.

DOCTOR V623
How about your blood sugars?

PATIENT V623
Uh they run crazy you know.  Usually in the morning they can be anywhere from you know 121 to you know 169 sometimes and uh then at afternoon it'll generally be in the 200s with some exceptions it'll be lower than that but most times in the afternoons are the low 200s.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  Do you have a log?

PATIENT V623
Yep.  I didn't bring it.

DOCTOR V623
No problem.  So just because, he has a primary care provider in Oak Park @@@ take the log in to show him.

SECOND PERSON V623
And uh his sugars in the evening sometimes drop way down.  They sometimes have you like 68 or 70 or something so then he doesn't take any insulin.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.  Okay.  So um that's not as good.  Low sugars are not good so um so if it's something that's consistent you might want to talk to the primary care doctor so that the large dose of Aspart might be lowered.  You can lower that.

PATIENT V623
Okay.

DOCTOR V623
To prevent you from, you said it's normally lower than normal is that right?

SECOND PERSON V623
Right.

DOCTOR V623
His blood sugar is normally lower.

SECOND PERSON V623
It's kind of normal in the morning and then @@@ .

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

SECOND PERSON V623
And so then it kind of peaks at noon.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
And then sometimes, this isn't always, but if he ever goes into low blood sugar it's in the afternoon.

DOCTOR V623
The afternoon.

SECOND PERSON V623
And it usually is um kind of normal-ish in the afternoon but once in a while.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.

PATIENT V623
It's normal.

DOCTOR V623
Yeah so this, @@@ his primary care doctor and then he gives us insulin.  

SECOND PERSON V623
When PATIENT goes to Physical Therapy a lot of times I'll run the log book up to either his doctor or the diabetes advisor.

DOCTOR V623
Oh good.

SECOND PERSON V623
And she does check it.

DOCTOR V623
Okay good.

SECOND PERSON V623
Pretty frequently.

DOCTOR V623
Good okay.  Okay.  Let's see.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON V623
His diabetes doctor said he was brittle.

DOCTOR V623
Yeah, yes.  Brittle means goes up and comes down he's definitely brittle.  And unfortunately that’s the hardest type to control but it requires exactly what you're doing testing and doing your logs every day so we can see the inconsistencies and then adjust the insulin for that.

PATIENT V623
Okay.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  @@@ uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
Down at Dialysis they want him to take, the dietician at Dialysis and his doctor have recommended that he drink Mepro, are you familiar with @@@.

DOCTOR V623
@@@?

SECOND PERSON V623
It's a drink um you know and not an energy drink but a drink to add to your nutrition and it's, I guess it's very high in fat and sugar but it's also high in protein.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
Which they want for his foot and everything else.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
You know but I haven't always agreed with it so um.  He takes that a some days and that sends his sugar up.

DOCTOR V623
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON V623
Because it has tons of sugar in it.

DOCTOR V623
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON V623
I just don't get it.  They said you need more when you're on dialysis.

DOCTOR V623
I would ask about alternatives because they know @@@ they have  lots of dialysis patients who are diabetes.@@@

SECOND PERSON V623
Now they have, you know they knew about the diabetes.  They knew everything and they said you know what we're going to tell you is actually the opposite of what you've been hearing about the diabetes and I didn't always agree with them so.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
But I understand they reformulating it at the end of this month so maybe it'll @@@.

DOCTOR V623
Yeah, okay.  How's your COPD?

PATIENT V623
How do I feel?

DOCTOR V623
Yeah the breathing?

PATIENT V623
Oh fine, fine.

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  No longer taking any inhalers for that.

PATIENT V623
No.

DOCTOR V623
And your cardiologist said that you need to take aspirin or Plavix?

PATIENT V623
Uh no because I take the Coumadin.

DOCTOR V623
And you have @@@.

PATIENT V623
Yeah.

DOCTOR V623
Okay and then let's see.  Also did we talk about starting a medication called lisinopril or any medicine that ends with a pril?

SECOND PERSON V623
I don't know.

DOCTOR V623
A medication called lisinopril or.

PATIENT V623
What's that for?

DOCTOR V623
It's for the heart.  I think I mentioned it the last time.

SECOND PERSON V623
I don't remember because, I don't remember that do you?  Um is it something he was on or did?

DOCTOR V623
No he'd never been on it, I just don't know why he'd never been on this um.  @@@.  Does he have heart disease?  @@@.  It helps the heart.

SECOND PERSON V623
Well you know.

PATIENT V623
What's the other uh medication.

SECOND PERSON V623
You take the amiodarone.

PATIENT V623
No.

SECOND PERSON V623
@@@  You take @@@ and you take carvedilol.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
And the folic acid does that help?

DOCTOR V623
That’s not for the heart.

PATIENT V623
Some specific heart medicine.

SECOND PERSON V623
Like Coreg.

PATIENT V623
Yes.

SECOND PERSON V623
Okay that's the same as carvedilol

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V623
Oh it is oh okay.

SECOND PERSON V623
Yeah I don't know.

PATIENT V623
Yeah that.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
Um DOCTOR is his cardiologist.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
And he's the one you know you told me to get an appointment.

DOCTOR V623
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON V623
@@@.  He didn’t make any other changes to his and they used to say that PATIENT had congestive heart failure.

DOCTOR V623
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON V623
But that seems to have kind of dropped out of the picture, I don't know.  DOCTOR said his heart was the best thing about him the other day.  Maybe that's small praise I don't know.

DOCTOR V623
Yes, yes.

SECOND PERSON V623
But uh.

(Someone knocked on the door, doctor speaks with that person)

DOCTOR V623
So we'll just check some labs here.  Your blood pressure was perfect today.  

SECOND PERSON V623

DOCTOR V623
Seems pretty regular this time.  Your abnormal heartbeat goes in and out. It doesn’t seem like it’s constantly there. You had an amputation here?

SECOND PERSON V623

DOCTOR V623
You had an amputation here?

PATIENT V623

PATIENT V623
Oh regular.

DOCTOR V623
Yeah normally it is irregular.

PATIENT V623
Yeah.

DOCTOR V623

PATIENT V623

DOCTOR V623
But today its regular.

PATIENT V623

SECOND PERSON V623
You mean on the outside or here?

PATIENT V623
No.

DOCTOR V623

SECOND PERSON V623

DOCTOR V623
Okay.  Alright I've ordered him the yearly labs for you so, do you live far?

SECOND PERSON V623
No.

SECOND PERSON V623

DOCTOR V623

SECOND PERSON V623
Okay.  Alright I'm just thinking next Monday he's going to have some surgery at Loyola.  I don't know how well he'll feel. I was thinking maybe we could run over here cause he can't eat anyway.
