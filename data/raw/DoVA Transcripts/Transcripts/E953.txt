PATIENT E953
Okay.

DOCTOR E953
Um to make sure your breathing is not because of asthma, lung disease, get a chest x-ray and get an ultrasound of your heart.  Cause like I said even if you're not having chest pain you can have shortness of breath just from heart problems.  No family history of heart problems?

PATIENT E953
