DOCTOR X012
Come on back sir.  How you doing?

PATIENT X012
Oh I'm doing alright.  The arthritis, it's a little @@@ to walk after.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
It's just that I had a little thing that occurred within the last 24 hours with my ankle.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT X012
Yes.

DOCTOR X012
@@@.

PATIENT X012
The swelling has gone, basically gone down.

DOCTOR X012
Great.

PATIENT X012
Yeah, do I sit here or there?

DOCTOR X012
Oh it doesn't matter.

PATIENT X012
If I just take that shoe off, then I got to sit over here.

DOCTOR X012
Okay, that’s fine.

PATIENT X012
It that's the deal.  Uh, let’s see now.  Basically, you could see @@@ actually.  This one here is normal and this one is a little bit wider.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Do you want to see my feet or?

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Well I have a pain still though in my toe.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
Alright, these are socks @@@.  Anytime I'm walking I need and these are a little bit swollen right now.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
Well that's one half.

DOCTOR X012
So that's the spot in here huh?

PATIENT X012
Right here, it's focusing right up in here somewhere when I walk.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
I get pain in  here.  Now in the morning just right in here it'll be thinner in the morning that it is now.

DOCTOR X012
Sort of like swelling yeah.

PATIENT X012
Okay.

DOCTOR X012
Have you gone to Podiatry, I forget?

PATIENT X012
Podiatry?

DOCTOR X012
Yeah the foot doctors.

PATIENT X012
No, not at all.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
If you can just give me a hand and pull that up, it did swell on me my foot over here on walking because of what happened to me this morning, oh here, my ankles.

DOCTOR X012
What happened to you?

PATIENT X012
You tell me.  I’m just trying to get the initial stuff first.  Okay now this one here.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
You can see the difference here.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
And this is the way it is, usually at the end of the day, kind of still swollen like that.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
And in the morning this will not be like this, it’ll be...

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Down a lot.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
Okay, now a week and a half ago I got a @@@, should I put these on.

DOCTOR X012
You leave them off now if you like @@@.

PATIENT X012
Oh okay, okay, good.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Uh I got a virus, bad virus a week and a half ago.  I was in the Emergency Room.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
@@@ get antibiotics for it.  Its congestion and I'm sitting at home for three days on my back, laying on my back.

DOCTOR X012
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X012
And I don't know if it had something to do with my intake of the amount of juice that I had but I guess I drank 3 1/2 gallons of orange juice and lemonade and I didn't know it has a lot of acid in it and if that's just part of the gout or something.  Maybe I'm wrong about it.

DOCTOR X012
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X012
And maybe I am so anyhow I get this great pain right in here right through my ankles when I walk, it's like pins.  It just occurred this morning and then also getting a little stiffness in my knees.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
And it just occurred.  It started like yesterday.  I started sitting at my kitchen table, I felt a little stiffness and then tonight, last night I felt more and then this morning I was like walking like this pins and needles.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.  Now why were you laying down for so long?

PATIENT X012
Because of the virus I had, I was lying down.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
I was told @@@ that I shouldn't have done, but I didn’t know the difference.

DOCTOR X012
Okay, alright so how is your breathing doing?

PATIENT X012
Alright.

DOCTOR X012
Do you feel better?

PATIENT X012
Well my breathing is a little bit heavier now cause I got this virus now, it's just something that occurred.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
In my lungs.

DOCTOR X012
But are you definitely getting better with that virus you think?

PATIENT X012
Well I hope so yeah because it was terrible.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
I mean I was coughing up phlegm 50 times a day and now I've coughed up maybe a few times, that's all.

DOCTOR X012
Okay, no fevers or chills?

PATIENT X012
Uh no.

DOCTOR X012
Okay, okay.  You're not feeling real short of breath?

PATIENT X012
No.

DOCTOR X012
Except when you really exert yourself?

PATIENT X012
No, well I could sometimes you know if I go from the second floor of steps.  It's just I get the pain.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Cause when you have pain you have exhaustion so you cough.

DOCTOR X012
Are you still taking the doxycycline, the antibiotic they gave you?

PATIENT X012
The what?

DOCTOR X012
The antibiotic they gave you?

PATIENT X012
Oh yeah, I got to go four more days on it.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
I got four more pills.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
Now I stopped taking the water pills about three days ago.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
I don't know if I should have done that or not.

DOCTOR X012
Well how do you think you've been doing since you stopped it?

PATIENT X012
Well since I stopped it you know, like I said, in the mornings they're thinner than what they are now but you know this stuff's come back every night and it's kind of like this.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT X012
So I don't know what to do and how long is it going on for you what I'm saying you know.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.  Well I think I'd probably keep you on something.  Um you're taking two tabs by mouth every morning and you were getting 80 twice a day.  I'd probably keep you on, so I think there's a couple of things.  Um you know I think you probably did have some gout which is why you got better with the steroids.  Um and now we have you on colchicine which is another treatment for gout but the thing.

PATIENT X012
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X012
With steroids is you can only go on it for a short period of time cause it's really bad for you to be on.

PATIENT X012
Colchicine.

DOCTOR X012
Colchicine, you're on that now.

PATIENT X012
Yeah, I got about maybe about eight more tablets, ten more tablets.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah so.

PATIENT X012
I shouldn’t use that?

DOCTOR X012
No I'm saying the steroids.  The prednisone is what you can't be on for a long time.

PATIENT X012
I don't have no more steroids.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah so we gave you that for a short period.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.

DOCTOR X012
Now we have you on colchicine.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.

DOCTOR X012
Um and the question is should we continue you on that for a little while and switched it to a different medicine for the gout.

PATIENT X012
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X012
You're saying this toe here is still hurting you a little?

PATIENT X012
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
If I bend it like this you'll feel it, when I do one of these here.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
You can feel it kind of from and it goes right up in here.  It's the main bone @@@ from the foot you know and it's kind of the same right here also.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.  

PATIENT X012
Alright.

DOCTOR X012
Does it hurt you like just to touch it?

PATIENT X012
No.

DOCTOR X012
No.

PATIENT X012
Uh no, no.  A little bit yeah right here.  Now if I press down on this part I will get pain.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Right here uh this one here a little bit.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
Not much.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.  Well I think what we could probably do today is stop the colchicine and switch you to something that you could take.  I think you know it looks like you may have a problem with gout you know over time.

PATIENT X012
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X012
So I think allopurinol is the medicine that you can stay on forever to prevent the gout from flaring up again.

PATIENT X012
Oh.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.  The prednisone and the colchicine are kind of short-term medications to use when things are really bad but the allopurinol you can stay on, it should keep that uric acid level down and it should prevent you from getting the flare-ups of your gout.

PATIENT X012
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.  So I think we should probably do that today.

PATIENT X012
Uh, okay now getting back to the second matter though, this recent thing and like I say in my ankle.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
What causes this?

DOCTOR X012
Well I don't know but maybe it was because you were not moving around very much for a couple of days and now you're kind of up on your feet again.

PATIENT X012
Really?

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Because um see I was moving around in the hospital Tuesday, I had to go to different departments.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
It was Tuesday, yeah I think it was Tuesday, I think it was Tuesday.

DOCTOR X012
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X012
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Thursday.

DOCTOR X012
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X012
Yeah and when I went home I was real tired out in my legs.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Uh fatigued and they were in pain from walking, just walking in the hospital here.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
I don't think, should that have been because according to my therapist I should be walking more and look at this now you know.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah, yeah, well you know it takes some time to get into it so I think you know you should be pushing yourself a little at a time to get back if you can uh but it's not surprising that when you first really get into it that you might have some pain at the end of the day either okay.  So what you want to do is stay active and you know every day kind of push yourself a little bit more but you have to be kind of patient with this okay.  Um I think we should definitely get you into Podiatry because you, despiste, you know even once we get your gout completely taken care of and the fluid, you have pretty beat up feet.

PATIENT X012
Oh yes.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Okay sorry about that.

DOCTOR X012
So, no it's fine.

PATIENT X012
This is uh due to a sport, I know my toes @@@ and it's kind of taking up the parking place.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
In the other toes and this one is coming in.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.  So some of the pain I think may be just related to your, the way your feet are.

PATIENT X012
And my right one is the bad one.  I have this over here holding cause the toe kind of reaches over the first toe.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Over the big toe.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah, yeah.  So they may be able to help just with some special shoes and.

PATIENT X012
Oh I've gone to foot doctors before and it's pretty painful what they give you.  I know I was walking on cardboard at one time and it was awful.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
I mean, what I need is surgical where the toe is brought back @@@ this one is.

DOCTOR X012
I was going to say.

PATIENT X012
And do this you know.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah they're the ones that do the surgery too so.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.

DOCTOR X012
You know.

PATIENT X012
I went there one time and I did ask about my feet and I did.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
And they kind of said no they can't do it.

DOCTOR X012
Let's send you back and see what they think now okay.

PATIENT X012
Okay.

DOCTOR X012
It's not going to hurt anything.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.  It's just that since the 4th of February I am just up to my neck with going to Hines hospital, coming here so much.  I just came out of a PTSD class.

DOCTOR X012
Oh.

PATIENT X012
Which I was taking for like uh two weeks now.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
And I've been coming here and that was out of the medical part and now the mental thing.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
And then now.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah you've had a lot going on lately.

PATIENT X012
@@@.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.  Well okay.

PATIENT X012
And I'd of course like to get something done.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah, yeah.  Well even if, it will take a while for them to get you in.

PATIENT X012
Alright.

DOCTOR X012
I think the next time they see you we'll at least @@@.

PATIENT X012
Alright oh I see.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
Uh but can you tell me what I have, cause like still with that, it just happened this morning.

DOCTOR X012
That feeling of the numbness kind of @@@.

PATIENT X012
The pins in here and I can't, in my ankles, ankles when I walk.

DOCTOR X012
Has it been there continuously all day?

PATIENT X012
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah and do you have numbness and tingling on the bottom of your feet usually?

PATIENT X012
No.

DOCTOR X012
No pain?

PATIENT X012
No.

DOCTOR X012
No okay.  So are you having much pain in general anymore or no?

PATIENT X012
Uh I get a little stiffness in the knees. When I get going and they loosen up and I got more power in my right leg, the operating knee is better @@@ and power but not recently in the last 24 hours, not since I got this stiffness cause this stiffness also affected my knees too.

DOCTOR X012
Okay, okay, okay.  I don't know exactly.

PATIENT X012
I don't know I just thought that maybe three gallons of orange juice had something to do with it.

DOCTOR X012
Well that's a lot of; I wouldn't drink that much orange juice.

PATIENT X012
Yeah I know that now.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Yeah and it does have acid in there right?

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Is it part of this I don't know?

DOCTOR X012
Uh it's hard to say.

PATIENT X012
Oh I see.

DOCTOR X012
But I would kind of; it's good to drink water but not so much juice okay.

PATIENT X012
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR X012
Try to drink more just regular water.  You can have a little orange juice but no more than one or two glasses a day okay.

PATIENT X012
Yeah but I was sick when I was at the house all day.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
So.

DOCTOR X012
But yeah I don't know what would cause.  If you have continuous numbness and tingling in your feet then we need to know about it but let's see if it goes away.  I mean I don't know what caused it.

PATIENT X012
It just occurred now, this thing on the ankle.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.  So I think we just need to understand what you were doing with the water pills.  So you were taking 80 mg in the morning and 80 at night right?

PATIENT X012
Yeah I was taking it in the morning and at night.

DOCTOR X012
And now you're not taking anything?

PATIENT X012
I didn't take it in the last three days.  One of the reason is cause I got so sick with this virus.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
I just couldn't handle all the pills you know.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
I wanted to get this out of me you know so I don't know if that had anything to do with the swelling right now.

DOCTOR X012
I think what I'd like to do is have, keep you on a small dose of the water pill, less than what you were taking just once a day.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
Because you know the urination part is irritating after a while you know what I mean.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
It's quite abundant.

DOCTOR X012
Sure, sure, okay.  Um okay let me talk to DOCTOR cause I know he was interested with what's going on with your feet last time you were here okay.  So let me listen to your lungs first.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.  I might need to get something here cause I still got congestion.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah, take a deep breath.  Okay, you're not a smoker right?

PATIENT X012
No.

DOCTOR X012
They didn't do an x-ray of your chest when you went in no?

PATIENT X012
Oh they took many x-rays of my chest, I think before the operation.

DOCTOR X012
But not when you were just in the Emergency Room?

PATIENT X012
Oh no, none.

DOCTOR X012
Okay let me @@@ DOCTOR take a look at your feet okay.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.

DOCTOR X012
I’ll be right back.

PATIENT X012
I think that the bursitis in my left arm is getting worse and worse so I'm just kind of living with it.  It's in my left arm right up in here.

DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
It bothers me when I'm at rest you know.

DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.  I'll take a look at it when I come back in okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  19:15  DOCTOR IN:  28:31)

DOCTOR X012
@@@.

PATIENT X012
How been doing there doc?

SECOND DOCTOR X012
I'm well and how are you?  We talked on the phone and DOCTOR told me that you get better but then bounce back.

PATIENT X012
Exactly, that’s what it seems like.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
@@@ Yeah these are pretty worn, I agree.  Yeah I think it's that gout's come back.  I was hoping to keep you off that prednisone but uh we were talking about that.  I think we're going to be putting you back on it uh, so this is going to be a little bit difference however and DOCTOR is going to explain more but uh I do think that this is pretty much gout that's basically causing all these problems.  There are medicines that can help you keep gout flares, gouty flares away and hopefully you won't have to worry about this again but we have to try to go through this stepwise process.

PATIENT X012
Yeah and it goes with you all your life.  I never had gout since this operation you know eight weeks ago.  What the heck caused it though?

SECOND DOCTOR X012
You know sometimes it does happen where people are predisposed but have never had problems, then something happens, a stressful situation uh whatever that would be uh emotional stress, physical stress, surgery and it kind of flares up so that's a possibility.

PATIENT X012
And explain to me about the initial thing that happened over the last 24 hours, my ankle right here, oh my God, it's like walking on pins again.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
It was like when I those feet blown up real big before.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Yeah I remember what they were before.

PATIENT X012
Yeah but this is in the ankle right here and it just happened though, it started last night in the evening.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Is that gout or?

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Well we think it's a combination of gout and fluid in the ankles.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Okay so DOCTOR is going to talk to you a little bit about a couple of medicines that we're going to be putting you on.  Uh you've been on them before albeit now that we kind of have a better idea of what we're dealing with I think we have a better direction of how we're going to handle these medicines so she's going to give you instructions on them.

PATIENT X012
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
I see and would you guys maybe follow up on it in a week and a half or so, I can call you.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Yeah. You can give me a call.

PATIENT X012
‘cause I know it's like a month maybe if I see you in between, you know I'm just seeing you.  I mean I don't mind as long as it goes down.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Uh but it seems like you know they go down in the morning and then in the evening they blow-up again.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Cause I'm just walking.  I'm walking daily but not that much at all.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
I understand.

PATIENT X012
I mean what does it take for these things to go away?

SECOND DOCTOR X012
We kind of.

PATIENT X012
I have a question like that you know.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Well gout is because you have too much of a substance in the body called uric acid, it's a natural substance and some people have more of it than others.  When you have too much of it it tends to crystallize out and it crystallizes out in your feet, especially in your toes and your ankles and that causes inflammation, swelling and pain.  So certain medicines can help drop that uric acid level and that's what DOCTOR is going to talk to you more about.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.  Alright and then other thing is my injections I used to take, the cortisone in my knee, this one her, I won’t be using that any more because it's new.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
But my old knee, I don't know who I talk to about that, Orthopedics or?

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Ortho yeah.

PATIENT X012
Yeah you do.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
I'd send you to @@@ Ortho.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Really.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
She will make a referral for you to see somebody.

PATIENT X012
Cause they used to give me injections three times a year and it helped me out walking.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Actually, yeah so the rheumatologist is who we're going to have you be seen for your gout and also help you with your knee.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Okay, yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
But uh.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah okay.  Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Alright.

PATIENT X012
Yeah this thing flared up because I was here just two days ago I was walking up and down the corridor, I went home and my feet and legs were very tired.  I put them up, it was overnight and this is when they started to get stiff and stiffness in the last 24 hours.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
I think we're to go ahead and give you some medicine top pick up today @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
I have another question @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Well that's the thing; we probably would do it to keep it going.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Until we get the.

FIRST DOCTOR H44
Just a couple months.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
And even if you want to bring him back in a month or so.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
You know to check his uric acid and you could certainly test it in another month.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
In order to keep it simple and then prednisone and back next month.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
And then start the allopurinol?

SECOND DOCTOR X012
No I thought we'd go send him home with that since he's been.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Start right now.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Yeah have him start it in two weeks.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Check a uric acid level you know and @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah, yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
I think @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Okay, sounds good.

SECOND DOCTOR X012
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Okay thank you.  Alright so we're gonna make some changes to your medications okay.  I'm going to write it down for you so you don't get confused.

PATIENT X012
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Okay.  This is what we're gonna do, we're gonna stop the colchicine.

PATIENT X012
See this here, if I bend my knee right now it feels stiff right in here.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Is that also affecting the @@@?

FIRST DOCTOR X012
No the gout's probably, I don't know if any.

PATIENT X012
Why is the knee getting stiff all of a sudden?

FIRST DOCTOR X012
I don't know.  Let's do one thing at once okay.

PATIENT X012
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Let's try to deal with this gout okay.  

PATIENT X012
Thinking of what I used to do.  I can still take a hot bath or something.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.  So the prednisone will probably help with your knee too okay.  And what we're going to do is we're going to, take prednisone, do you want pick it up today or do you want it to come in the mail?

PATIENT X012
Oh God, oh what time is it now, @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
It's 3:40.

PATIENT X012
Yeah, I got to make it to a meeting?

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Well you'd probably @@@.

PATIENT X012
Well I thought they were open until around 4:30 or 5, like I say.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
So what do you think do you want to get it at the window?

PATIENT X012
Yeah I guess so.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
That's all I can do if I don't fall asleep, I'm so tired right now.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Got up this morning, running around before I come here, oh boy, I gave myself a little time you know but when you called and came back just sitting.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah okay.

PATIENT X012
It seems like I'm losing energy, somewhat I don't know why.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
Cause when I get up, it's like there's a biochemistry that changed me since this operation.  And I had never been operated on in my whole life and never had anything cut open.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Uh-huh.

PATIENT X012

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.

PATIENT X012
A knee replaced.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah, well we'll get you taken care of.  I think you just have really bad gout and that's probably been a lot of your problems okay.  And a lot of people actually have it and you have a bad case but we'll get it under control so.

PATIENT X012
Bad case oh.  What about diet, I mean I don't know.  You supposed to, I can't eat red meat or nothing, is this true? Or, 

FIRST DOCTOR X012
You know I think.

PATIENT X012
I had to do with raw meat or something.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah.  One second, okay?

PATIENT X012
I might be running out of hydrocodone.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Okay.

PATIENT X012
Probably, I got about ten tablets left and I think I'm having them every three to four hours so I don't know if I should have you – should I still be on it?

FIRST DOCTOR X012
If you need it, that's a pain medicine.

PATIENT X012
Yeah now I use it, but I think I need it yeah.  I hope I can get any of these, if I can get them at this time and.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Okay.  Yeah I can refill that for you okay.  So this is, I want to go over the plan okay, one second.  Let me write it down for you so you don't forget.

PATIENT X012
And then are you going to put in something for me with the foot people, what do you call them, and I'll hear from them in the future.

FIRST DOCTOR X012
Yeah, the podiatrist.

PATIENT X012
Podiatrist yeah, podiatrist.  They were operated on, I want you to know this, by the other doctor, just the right foot. They just came with the hammertoe

FIRST DOCTOR X012
