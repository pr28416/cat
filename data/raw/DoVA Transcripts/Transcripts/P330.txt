Are you eating okay?

PATIENT P330
Uh I’m eating too much.  Actually, @@@ am eating a lot.

DOCTOR P330
Do you think it’s because you’re depressed that you’re eating a lot? Or?

PATIENT P330
No I think it’s because it's getting close to the time to do the colonoscopy.

DOCTOR P330
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P330
And my, my nerves is just bad now, it's just.

DOCTOR P330
Don't worry about, it's not that bad.

PATIENT P330
No um I mean I'm just, I'm just, you know I'm not comfortable at all now, mentally about it.

DOCTOR P330
Why?

PATIENT P330
It's just I don't know I'm just you know these conversations about all the guys.  I'm just not comfortable about doing the colonoscopy now cause like I say my nerves is so bad.  I don't have the patience no more.

DOCTOR P330
It’s not going to get better, though.

And the longer you wait the worse it is.

PATIENT P330
I know and then I started back drinking, uh man I started back up.

DOCTOR P330
How much are you drinking now?

PATIENT P330
Like three beers, a couple shots.

DOCTOR P330
Every day?

PATIENT P330
Yeah there are things going on.

DOCTOR P330
Why did you start drinking again?

PATIENT P330
I don't know, when I started to get closer, closer to the doing you see I was fine last month now, drinking or nothing.  Yeah as I get closer to this procedure.

DOCTOR P330
Why are you so nervous about it?

PATIENT P330
I don't know, I don't, I don't.

DOCTOR P330
It's not painful, they're gonna give you medications to make you sleepy.

PATIENT P330
I understand that but I mean.

DOCTOR P330
It's one day and you can get it out of your mind for years to come.

PATIENT P330
Years to come.  Maybe I got to put that in my mind.

DOCTOR P330
It’s not like you are going to do this every year.

PATIENT P330
Yeah.

DOCTOR P330
Think of it as @@@.

PATIENT P330
Yeah.

DOCTOR P330
Once you get it done, they find something, they get rid of it and then you don't have to worry about colon cancer for years to come.

PATIENT P330
Yeah.

DOCTOR P330
Um the preparation um when they give it to you, you have to take it um put it in the frig and by like uh use one of those lemonade flavoring for the water.

PATIENT P330
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P330
You can buy like one of those packets and just mix it in.

PATIENT P330
Mix it in it okay.

DOCTOR P330
Um and everyone has to go through this.  So you're definitely not alone.

PATIENT P330
@@@ with the @@@.

DOCTOR P330
With everything, the procedure, everyone gets nervous.  I mean haven't, you haven't had it done before so you don't know what to expect you know it's part of it but, you're a strong man.

PATIENT P330
Right.

DOCTOR P330
Right.

PATIENT P330
Yeah I'm a strong man.  @@@ drug free. Never did any drugs.

DOCTOR P330
I don't want you to start drinking because of it though uh.

PATIENT P330
Yeah I had got away from it.  I had got away from it and it's like up until this month, for some reason, I just, I don't know.  I have like uh, what I say, aggressive thoughts.

DOCTOR P330
Did you get the flu shot today?

PATIENT P330
No I don't do that stuff no.

DOCTOR P330
No, why not?

PATIENT P330
No I never got it.  The last flu shot I got was in the service 30 years ago.

DOCTOR P330
Hmm.

PATIENT P330
I don't do it.  I ain't had the flu in years.

DOCTOR P330
So when do you have your appointment for the colonoscopy?

PATIENT P330
Two weeks, I think its two weeks.  It's on the 20th or something @@@.

DOCTOR P330
Blood pressure is a little on the high side.

PATIENT P330
Yeah.  Is it from this @@@ or me worrying? Which one?

DOCTOR P330
Any pain right now?

PATIENT P330
@@@ when I stand up and walk but when I go to sitting down it's @@@ you know.  I know it's going to be a little pain.  They said I need refills on all my medicine too.

DOCTOR P330
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P330
Yeah I need all my medicine.

DOCTOR P330
You’re taking . . . @@@ you're just taking the amlodipine and the hydrochlorothiazide?  Oh and losartan.

PATIENT P330
I was doing good. It’s probably just those couple of shots of whiskey cause I hadn't had nothing for so long.

DOCTOR P330
Did you drink today? 

PATIENT P330
No nothing today, uh uh.

DOCTOR P330
 @@@.

PATIENT P330
Yeah I'm, I got up in good spirits, you know what I mean.

DOCTOR P330
We can keep an eye on it.  Um how's your diet?

PATIENT P330
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR P330
So how about the, feeling depressed do you think it's because of the same colonoscopy thing or it's something else?

PATIENT P330
I think it's that.

DOCTOR P330
So is it depression or is it anxiety?

PATIENT P330
Well I think it’s depression because.

DOCTOR P330
Why are you depressed?

PATIENT P330
Because I'm just, I have a brother with colon cancer.

DOCTOR P330
And how old is he?

PATIENT P330
And he's 49.

DOCTOR P330
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P330
I don't know.

DOCTOR P330
So is that more why you are afraid of getting the colonoscopy?

PATIENT P330
That and the procedure itself I mean, it’s why - I'm @@@ for all of that crazy stuff I don't know.

DOCTOR P330
Yeah well, every single man has to go through.

PATIENT P330
Yeah.

DOCTOR P330
Yeah.

PATIENT P330
Yeah but I understand.

DOCTOR P330
Besides, you have to talk about this with @@@.

PATIENT P330
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR P330
Now you're gonna, hopefully you'll know that you’re undergoing the colonoscopy @@@ you know.

PATIENT P330
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR P330
But I mean do you think you're just anxious cause you're afraid of it or stuff like that?

PATIENT P330
Yeah, I'd say just afraid of it you know.  Cause I was fine right before we got into this month.

DOCTOR P330
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P330
And now, I don’t know, it’s just @@@.

DOCTOR P330
I mean it's understandable.

PATIENT P330
Oh okay.

DOCTOR P330
@@@ it's definitely understandable that you are going to feel scared and anxious, especially when you have a brother that's not that much younger than you are.

PATIENT P330
Yeah my brother is 49.

DOCTOR P330
Did he have surgery for it?

PATIENT P330
Yeah.

DOCTOR P330
How's he doing?

PATIENT P330
He ain’t doing good at all.

DOCTOR P330
Did he end up getting chemotherapy or anything yet?

PATIENT P330
He's already, he doing chemo and he on dialysis too.

DOCTOR P330
From the cancer or from something else?

PATIENT P330
No he was on dialysis before the cancer.

DOCTOR P330
Uh-huh.  Is he a diabetic?

PATIENT P330
No I think it was drinking.

DOCTOR P330
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P330
And uh he's doing chemo now.  Some days you can't get both of them, so.  He's a little bitty guy, I mean, I’m a big guy.  He’s got, he might weighs 105 pounds.

DOCTOR P330
So I mean, you are healthier, it seems.

PATIENT P330
Yeah, yeah, @@@.

DOCTOR P330
Right now if they find something, if you have you know, if you haven't had problems with constipation  @@@ chances are that if they find something they should be able to @@@ you know without having to go @@@.

PATIENT P330
Well I understand the blockages, I don't have those.

DOCTOR P330
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P330
I don't.

DOCTOR P330
And that doesn't mean if they go in there they're going to find anything but there's always the chance of them you know, sometimes cancer starts like you know a little pimple.

PATIENT P330
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P330
And then it starts growing.  But if they find something like that they'll just take it out.

PATIENT P330
They'll just.

DOCTOR P330
And then send it out for analysis and figure out whatever it is.

PATIENT P330
And then there's the chance it ain't nothing.

DOCTOR P330
Yeah.  There's a chance that you’re totally clean.

PATIENT P330
Oh.

DOCTOR P330
And if they don't see anything then you're clear for ten years to come.

PATIENT P330
There's no other symptoms, no problem.

DOCTOR P330
But sometimes, sometimes you don't need to have symptoms, that’s why we do it starting at 50.  You and me, anyone can have it starting @@@ without even knowing it.

PATIENT P330
Oh okay.

DOCTOR P330
It's better to prevent something than to be sorry later.

PATIENT P330
That’s right.

DOCTOR P330
So were you ever on antidepressants at any point in the past?

PATIENT P330
Uh no I was taking some uh, well I take some mental health meds now.

DOCTOR P330
You're taking trazodone?

PATIENT P330
Trazodone and because I was having sleeping problems.

DOCTOR P330
Hmm, that's it right?  Amitriptyline.

PATIENT P330
Right.

DOCTOR P330
You're taking both of them at bedtime?

PATIENT P330
Oh I take it at bedtime.

DOCTOR P330
And you're still not sleeping well?

PATIENT P330
Uh I was sleeping well. I was getting too much @@@.

DOCTOR P330
The colonoscopy is the 21st.

PATIENT P330
Oh it's the 21st.

DOCTOR P330
25th, sorry, the 25th.

PATIENT P330

PATIENT P330
Hmm.

DOCTOR P330
And I hope that everything goes well and you can just forget about it for 10 years.

PATIENT P330
Yep, well I hope that's the case.  @@@.  I don't like the way I'm feeling with this drinking.

DOCTOR P330
Yeah @@@.

PATIENT P330
And uh I've been away from that for a while.  Yup.

DOCTOR P330

DOCTOR P330
Neuralgia.

PATIENT P330
As far as I know.

DOCTOR P330
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P330
It's not a form of arthritis?

DOCTOR P330
@@@ no.

PATIENT P330
Oh.

DOCTOR P330
It has nothing to do with arthritis.

PATIENT P330
Okay, cause if I'm under the cover it really sends it off.

DOCTOR P330
When you have something on top?

PATIENT P330
No when I got nothing like when I'm sleeping and @@@ under the cover.

DOCTOR P330
When you go under the covers?

PATIENT P330
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR P330
Yeah.  And that is because you are stimulating the nerves on the skin.

PATIENT P330
Oh.

DOCTOR P330
Which are the nerves that are affected.  So just anything that irritates the nerves and that triggers.

PATIENT P330
Is that gonna be a lifetime thing?

DOCTOR P330
Probably.  You've had that for a while.

PATIENT P330
It's been a while yeah.  I've had three episodes of Bell palsy and that's the nerves.

DOCTOR P330
Yeah the @@@ nerves and the carpal tunnel is the nerves.

PATIENT P330
Yeah.

DOCTOR P330
Are you the only one in your family with this?

PATIENT P330
Yep.  I’m the only one!

DOCTOR P330
You won the lottery huh.

PATIENT P330
I don't want the lottery for that.  Yep.@@@

DOCTOR P330
Any chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fevers?

PATIENT P330
I've been having uh, no chest pain.  I was in the hospital uh 2001 for chest pain.

DOCTOR P330
And what did they say?

PATIENT P330
They did all of the testing everything and they said I didn't have no heart attack or nothing.

DOCTOR P330
Was it like heartburn?  Did they tell you what they think it was?

PATIENT P330
Oh, that's @@@ follow-up appointment.  It might have been something bit me cause I had a rash across here and across my back and uh.

DOCTOR P330
What kind of pain was it?

PATIENT P330
Oh it was a running pain, sharp running pain.

DOCTOR P330
Sharp?

PATIENT P330
Uh @@@ numbness in my arms.

DOCTOR P330
But if you like, did it feel like, @@@.

PATIENT P330
Yes, yes, yeah, just like that.  It was a sharp pain.

DOCTOR P330
Hmm.  Have you had it again?

PATIENT P330
No I haven't had it no more.

DOCTOR P330
Okay.

PATIENT P330
No more but it seem like after I use the albuterol it clears a lot of that.

DOCTOR P330
What do you use the albuterol for?

PATIENT P330
Just sometime I get uh congested, I can't breathe.

DOCTOR P330
Okay.  Do you have asthma?

PATIENT P330
I @@@ I have a touch of it.

DOCTOR P330
Um.

PATIENT P330
@@@.  I'm more worried - I keep being told I'm on the borderline as a diabetic.

DOCTOR P330
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P330
Now either I am or I ain't.

DOCTOR P330
Well some people have a what’s called, like, um insulin intolerance so say you produce enough insulin but sometimes the body you know @@@.

PATIENT P330
Exactly.  Exactly.

DOCTOR P330
So.

PATIENT P330
But I thought that's what that Vitamin B was supposed @@@.

DOCTOR P330
Vitamin helps for the nerves and the blood levels but the insulin, the sugar doesn't make any difference.

PATIENT P330
Okay.

DOCTOR P330
But let me see.  Okay.  Let me take a look.  Do you have numbness right now?

PATIENT P330
Uh just right here.

DOCTOR P330

PATIENT P330
I've only had it three or four times throughout the year.

SECOND DOCTOR P330
When do you get it, what are you doing when you get it?

Uh, probably pick up something or carrying groceries or something or later.

SECOND DOCTOR P330
Later on you mean, not while you're.

PATIENT P330
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR P330
It's probably just musculoskeletal I would think.

PATIENT P330
No, nowhere else.

SECOND DOCTOR P330

SECOND DOCTOR P330
Hmm.

PATIENT P330
And I got that electric shock where they stick you.

SECOND DOCTOR P330
It still could be @@@, still could be mononeuritis multiplex.  It really could be you know usually there's an explanation for that.  Um you know it could just, it could be like you know, I don't know it; I know all these things are common.  It could just be a bad coincidence that we have all these like things like the Bell’s Palsy and the neuralgias, I know that's three different things I know.

PATIENT P330
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR P330
Yeah.

PATIENT P330
@@@.  What was?

SECOND DOCTOR P330
You know it could be.

FIRST DOCTOR P330

FIRST DOCTOR P330

SECOND DOCTOR P330
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
And he's on amlodipine like 2.5, like low dose okay.

SECOND DOCTOR P330
Yeah I thought, I wanted to see @@@.  Alright very good @@@ okay.  Sorry I don't have any good answers for you, sometimes we don't.  And it's really frustrating, as frustrating as it is for you it is for us um.

PATIENT P330
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR P330
Yeah uh, some of these nerve things you know we just don't know why they come about but we did a pretty extensive work-up.  We checked uh, to be sure we checked a lot of things and we sent you to the neurologist and they're scratching their heads as well @@@ when I walk by there.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
So with everything, I'm going to increase the amitriptyline.

PATIENT P330
What's that?

FIRST DOCTOR P330
The one you take at bedtime or the trazodone.

PATIENT P330
Oh yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
I'm going to increase the dose so you can sleep better okay.  Do you want to pick these up at the window or do you want them mailed?

PATIENT P330
Uh I need to pick up my albuterol at the window.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
Anything else?

PATIENT P330
And everything else can come in the mail.  If @@@ renewal um.  I have some cream too that works well to keep your skin from being dry. I was using on this thigh over here.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
Like a @@@.

PATIENT P330
Not that heat stuff, not that.  This is kind of like @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
Does that help?

PATIENT P330
Well it kept me from being dry and scratching it you know I mean.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
Okay.

PATIENT P330
It's kind of like a salve.  Can I get refills on Levitra?

FIRST DOCTOR P330
Um.

PATIENT P330
Then I'll stay happy.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
As long as you don't end the colonoscopy appointment, I'll renew them.

PATIENT P330
Alright I'll go to the appointment.  Fifteen days.  So do you, there's a chance this leg is what’s causing this Bell’s Palsy@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
Hmm.  What the leg?

PATIENT P330
You think this.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
It's the same cause as this.

PATIENT P330
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
Same cause as this.

PATIENT P330
So it's getting worse.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
It doesn't, no, uh uh.

PATIENT P330
Cause I @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
No um I can’t tell you that this is not going to happen again.

PATIENT P330
Right, right.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
But if it gets worse it doesn't mean @@@.

PATIENT P330
Oh okay, okay, alright.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
Okay, perfect.  So I've renewed everything.  Let me make sure you can pick this one at the window and mail them and then I'll see you back in four months um.  But if you want, you can come in like a month just to get your blood pressure checked, just to make sure it's really not this high.

PATIENT P330
But don't take those two pills, just keep taking one.

FIRST DOCTOR P330
Just keep taking what you’re taking.
