DOCTOR C603
How are you doing today?

PATIENT C603
Well I'm not so good.

DOCTOR C603
We can talk about it.

PATIENT C603
Okay.  I got it.

DOCTOR C603
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT C603
Put my stuff over here?

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.  What's going on?

PATIENT C603
Well, it's to be expected.  I have cancer of both lungs.

DOCTOR C603
Right.

PATIENT C603
And I'm on chemo.

DOCTOR C603
Right.

PATIENT C603
So there gonna be some good days and some bad days.

DOCTOR C603
Okay.

PATIENT C603
This would be one of my bad days you know, a little dizzy but no pain or anything like that.

DOCTOR C603
Okay.

PATIENT C603
I'm not falling down dizzy you know.

DOCTOR C603
Do you feel.

PATIENT C603
Sort of like you feel after you have three shots you know.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.  I think that, I was just looking through your chart.  I think we can stop one of your blood pressure medicines.  So the blood pressure is pretty low, has it ever been high since we started the chemo?

PATIENT C603
Uh no.  In fact, a couple of times.

DOCTOR C603
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C603
It has, you know its bottom.

DOCTOR C603
Right.

PATIENT C603
Has been in the 90s.

DOCTOR C603
In the 90s yeah.

PATIENT C603
Yeah.

DOCTOR C603
I think we should, if it's alright with you, try stopping the blood pressure medicine, the hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT C603
Oh that's the little yellow pill.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.

PATIENT C603
It makes you get up sometime at night.

DOCTOR C603
The water pill right.

PATIENT C603
Right.

DOCTOR C603
Um I'll talk with DOCTOR but I think and that'll help you from being, so you were losing water by taking that and so.

PATIENT C603
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR C603
That causes some dizziness and some low blood pressures.

PATIENT C603
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR C603
But maybe we could try.

PATIENT C603
Okay.

DOCTOR C603
Cause I don't think you need it anymore.

PATIENT C603
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.

PATIENT C603
For a long period, as long as my blood pressure been down.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.

PATIENT C603
Yeah.

DOCTOR C603
It's going, let me just check and see.

PATIENT C603
Well I feel, well I still have my nifedipine.

DOCTOR C603
You still have the nifedipine?

PATIENT C603
Yeah.

DOCTOR C603
What's that uh, let's see.  How much of that are you taking?

PATIENT C603
Well, it was 90 right?

DOCTOR C603
Right, it's 90.

PATIENT C603
90 mg.

DOCTOR C603
Okay.  Let's talk with DOCTOR.  I think we should go down on one of these blood pressure medicines.

PATIENT C603
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR C603
Either the nifedipine we can, since that's a pretty strong dose maybe we could just cut it to 60 instead of 90.

PATIENT C603
Hey good.

DOCTOR C603
Or we could get rid of the hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT C603
Completely.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.

PATIENT C603
Until further notice.

DOCTOR C603
Right, right.

PATIENT C603
Okay.

DOCTOR C603
I'll, I'll talk to him and see what he thinks is the.

PATIENT C603
Okay.

DOCTOR C603
Better thing to do.

PATIENT C603
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR C603
Any fevers or chills?

PATIENT C603
Uh no.

DOCTOR C603
No.

PATIENT C603
Uh.

DOCTOR C603
Any trouble breathing?

PATIENT C603
Uh uh.

DOCTOR C603

PATIENT C603
Yes, you know just the dizziness.

DOCTOR C603
Okay.

PATIENT C603
I was dizzy.  @@@.

DOCTOR C603
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C603
I had chemo three weeks ago.

DOCTOR C603
Right.

PATIENT C603
And right after you know, the body said hey what's this you giving me.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.

PATIENT C603
And uh and I been doing pretty good you know.  I no longer getting the blood-streaked sputum you know.

DOCTOR C603
That's good.

PATIENT C603
I hope it is.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.  And then did they talk to you about how many cycles of chemo you have to get or?

PATIENT C603
Uh right now they said, not to hold them to it, it all depends on the tests they take.

DOCTOR C603
How you're doing.

PATIENT C603
And what have you but they said approximately.

DOCTOR C603
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C603
Six - three weeks apart.

DOCTOR C603
Three weeks apart each one.

PATIENT C603
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.  You're going good.

PATIENT C603
Well I'm hanging in there.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.  So do you live with anyone then or?

PATIENT C603
Huh?

DOCTOR C603
Do you live by yourself or do you have someone to kind of help you out?

PATIENT C603
Uh I live in a building with 150 apartments.

DOCTOR C603
Okay.

PATIENT C603
And uh.

DOCTOR C603
Your neighbors are pretty nice?

PATIENT C603
Noisy, but sometimes that come in handy.  Once you get past 75 you can, you know the neighbors you know.  So they always want to know where you been and all that and you know when you came out, those type of neighbors.  I appreciate them, you know.

DOCTOR C603
Right, right.  So nobody stays like with you in the house though?

PATIENT C603
Uh no.

DOCTOR C603
Okay.  Do you that, would you like to if I could get it set up that a visiting nurse come by and just check on you once a week?  Just so you know if you need anything you know she could help get it.  I'll have to see if I can get that set up but you probably would qualify if you think that would help you.

PATIENT C603
Oh BNA?

DOCTOR C603
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C603
Yeah.  Okay.

DOCTOR C603
Do you have that already or?

PATIENT C603
No.

DOCTOR C603
No okay, yeah.  I think it might be helpful at this point in time.

PATIENT C603
I agree with you.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.  I'll see if I can get that set up.

PATIENT C603
Oh she can make suggestions you know.

DOCTOR C603
Sure, yeah.

PATIENT C603
You know maybe you should go to the hospital.

DOCTOR C603
Exactly.

PATIENT C603
You know.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.

PATIENT C603
Lighten up on the crown royal, you know things like that.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT C603
But I think it'd be a good idea.

DOCTOR C603
I think so too.  I'll see if I can, it'll take a while for it to get set up to but.

PATIENT C603
I know.

DOCTOR C603
But we'll get that started and um did you need any refills on any medications or anything?

PATIENT C603
Well, if he cut the hydrochlorothiazide to say 60.

DOCTOR C603
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C603
I mean to @@@ the nifedipine to say 60, I would need to get that refilled so I don't take the old 90 mg.

DOCTOR C603
Sure.  We will uh.

PATIENT C603
And only hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg is probably as low at it goes.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.  Well I'll ask him and see which one is better to do.

PATIENT C603
Okay.

DOCTOR C603
So.

PATIENT C603
Okay.  Yeah he's a good man.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah I mean either one is probably fine so.  I'll ask him.  Let me just take a listen to you and you want to sit up here for me?

PATIENT C603
Okay.

DOCTOR C603
@@@ oh you can finish your coffee.

PATIENT C603

DOCTOR C603

PATIENT C603

DOCTOR C603

PATIENT C603
You know I like the way you do things.  Oh about ten years ago.

DOCTOR C603
And do you have trouble eating or anything?

PATIENT C603
Uh no I eat soft food you know.

DOCTOR C603
You eat soft food.

PATIENT C603
And uh, according how this chemical thing works out you know if the process should go in remission or something then I worry about the teeth.

DOCTOR C603
Sure, no I understand.  That's more important right now.

PATIENT C603
Yeah.  So why worry about uh.

DOCTOR C603

PATIENT C603
Putting dentures in the gum.

PATIENT C603
No. 

DOCTOR C603
It's like um, it'll happen for a lot of different reasons.  Two of the most common ones are when people smoke a lot.

PATIENT C603
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR C603
They can get discolored like the bottom side finger @@@.

PATIENT C603
Both hands @@@ very much.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah its part and usually when that happens it's because people smoke a lot and then you worry about cancer, so the cancer causes the problem.

PATIENT C603
Oh okay.

DOCTOR C603
So it's uh nothing, we can't really do anything to change it.  You could just um you know clip your nails but they don't look that long I don’t know.

PATIENT C603

DOCTOR C603
Yeah so but yeah it's just part of the.

PATIENT C603

PATIENT C603
My skin is dry, you can tell by the crustiness of it.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.  You put any lotion or anything on it?

PATIENT C603
Up until the last couple of days.  When I'm coming to the doctor I don't put any lotion on the day before that.

DOCTOR C603

PATIENT C603
That's the end of the world you know.

DOCTOR C603
That's right I remember you telling me that last time.

PATIENT C603
Uh-huh on the Mayan calendar.

DOCTOR C603

PATIENT C603
Yeah I'm gaining a few pounds and I was you know hoping that wasn't @@@ because.

DOCTOR C603
I understand you.

PATIENT C603
On this procedure they don't want you to bloat up.

DOCTOR C603
Right, right.

PATIENT C603
You know, it good to gain a few pound but you start bloating up and swelling in the feet and all that.

DOCTOR C603
Yeah.

PATIENT C603
It's not good.  Okay doc.

DOCTOR C603
Alright I'll be right back.

PATIENT C603

DOCTOR C603

PATIENT C603

PATIENT C603
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR C603
And it was like 5 in May.  It kind of jumps around you know, that's not a big difference.  What you worry about is if it goes up by a lot, like if it doubles or triples.

PATIENT C603
Or keeps inching up.
