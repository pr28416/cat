DOCTOR C602
You know it's just the situation that you're on four medications and there are times when your blood pressure is markedly elevated.  We want to be sure that it's not just hypertension that there's not something else causing it and that's the really the only reason I bring that @@@ thing up.

PATIENT C602

DOCTOR C602
Just ask them cause they have it up there.

PATIENT C602
They do?  The last time they didn't set an appointment.  I didn't get an appointment, they said just to call you or let you know and then I called in for medicine and they said you didn't get an appointment well you didn't tell me.  

DOCTOR C602

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:24  DOCTOR IN:  43:03)

DOCTOR C602
Have you ever had a sleep study done?

PATIENT C602
A what?

DOCTOR C602
Sleep study?

PATIENT C602
No.

DOCTOR C602
Do you @@@ sleep at night?

PATIENT C602
Yeah well I do but not intentionally.  I fall sleep in the evening and I'll go down and turn something on the television, I'll fall asleep for an hour or so and then I can't go to bed right away so I go to bed about midnight, 1 o'clock and I sleep till about 7 o'clock or something like that.

DOCTOR C602
Okay.

PATIENT C602
I'm not tired, I'm mean if that's what you're looking into, I'm not tired.

DOCTOR C602
It's sometimes the cause of high blood pressure.  It's something called sleep apnea.

PATIENT C602
@@@.

DOCTOR C602
It's bad for the heart.  You don't snore or wake up in the middle of the night gasping for breath, that type of stuff?

PATIENT C602
Well I snore.  My wife, that's why she sleeps in another bedroom.  I always have snored.

DOCTOR C602
It's a situation where it's a test that you do in the Pulmonary Lab; it doesn't take much, where they evaluate whether you have sleeping troubles.  Uh you may not know it but this sleeping trouble puts stress on the heart and because of the stress on the heart, it can cause hypertension we can’t control with medicine.

PATIENT C602
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR C602
It's something that I want to do for you.

PATIENT C602
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR C602
But I want to schedule you for.  Why don't you go talk to the folks in the pulmonary lab.

PATIENT C602
Is that here?

DOCTOR C602
It's here.  Yeah, I'll schedule it, so it's not going to be today.

PATIENT C602
Okay.

DOCTOR C602
But uh why don't I schedule that for you.  

PATIENT C602
I need some refills of the clonidine too, so there are no refills remaining.

DOCTOR C602
Yeah we'll do that right now.

PATIENT C602
It says prior to May @@, @@@@ so I don't know what that means.

DOCTOR C602
Yeah whatever, I'll refill it. Especially @@@ one.

PATIENT C602
Uh-huh yeah.  And this one three, and this one three, and this one three.

DOCTOR C602
Alrighty so couple things I want to do with you.  I want to, if you're okay I'll send you to the Pulmonary folks for a sleep study and let’s not do the MRA test yet.

PATIENT C602
Let me check on that?

DOCTOR C602
I'm not going to do the test because it's a pretty, you know heavy duty thing to do.  @@@.  I want to make sure.

PATIENT C602
Let me check with the, I'll check with the doctor, DOCTOR.

DOCTOR C602
Please do.  Do one of two things, either fax them here if you have it or bring it in to your next appointment.  If you find out that you haven't had it done um call, like you would normally call for a refill.

DOCTOR C602

PATIENT C602

DOCTOR C602
You know maybe this test is for your wife, then.

PATIENT C602

DOCTOR C602

DOCTOR C602

PATIENT C602
Alright um alright I know the number to call.  I'll just call and I'll say yes or no.

DOCTOR C602
