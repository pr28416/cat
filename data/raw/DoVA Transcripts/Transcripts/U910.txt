DOCTOR U910
PATIENT? Hello.  How are you today?

PATIENT U910
Pretty good.

DOCTOR U910
Good to see you again.  Come on back.  Have a seat right there.  So I haven't seen you since the holidays, how have things been going?

PATIENT U910
Going down the toilet.

DOCTOR U910
Going downhill, what's going on?

PATIENT U910
Uh I @@@ shortness of breath.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
Even just minor exertion.

DOCTOR U910
How long has it been going on for you?

PATIENT U910
Been going a few months.

DOCTOR U910
A few months okay.  Next time that happens call me and we can get you in sooner okay.  I don't want you to wait that long if you feel.

PATIENT U910
You know I don't even know when I'm supposed to be seeing the cardiologist again.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah so you saw them in September it looks like, is that right?

PATIENT U910
Uh somewhere around there.

DOCTOR U910
DOCTOR. @@@ appointment. You don’t have anything in the books.

PATIENT U910
Not a heck of a lot.

DOCTOR U910
It says four months, so September, October, November, December, January, so you should have already had a follow-up with them.  We'll get you in to see them.  But first let's talk about this shortness of breath, what's going on?  It started four months, or then four months ago?

PATIENT U910
It's, I'm convinced that it's the blockage.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.  How far can you walk before you get short of breath?

PATIENT U910
Believe it or not, walking it comes and goes.  I might get a little off, I don't know somewhere.  The pain wipes out the shortness of breath.

DOCTOR U910
Like in your calves?

PATIENT U910
In here.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  Do you get like shin splints or.

PATIENT U910
That’s what it feels like.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
Whether it’s not...

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
@@@

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
But uh, trying to tie my shoes.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
That type of exertion and then in terms of not even exertion just sleeping.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
Getting into bed, curled on my side.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.  Do you feel more short of breath when you're laying flat at night?  Do you wake up short of breath at all?

PATIENT U910
It happens.

DOCTOR U910
You have woken up short of breath.  Okay and laying flat is okay.

PATIENT U910
Well I don't usually.

DOCTOR U910
You usually don't okay.

PATIENT U910
I don't usually.

DOCTOR U910
Okay that's fine and did you park your car out there and walk in today or do you valet?

PATIENT U910
I parked and walked in, I didn't have any problems.

DOCTOR U910
Not this time.

PATIENT U910
If I can take my time I'm alright.

DOCTOR U910
Okay, it's when you're kind of walking a little bit faster?

PATIENT U910
Yeah.  

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
If you can call it a little bit faster.

DOCTOR U910
Okay and then um how is that different from where you were when I last saw you?  Cause this obviously is new.  What were you able to do before that for a comparison?

PATIENT U910
I wasn't getting short of breath.  The only thing that was bothering me then was the pain.

DOCTOR U910
The pain.

PATIENT U910
In the legs.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.  And they said that was a neuropathy is that what, okay yeah.

PATIENT U910
That's what they said.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
Uh I wasn't that short of breath.

DOCTOR U910
That was never an issue.  It was the pain that made you stop.

PATIENT U910
No.

DOCTOR U910
And now it's like a little bit of both.

PATIENT U910
Right.

DOCTOR U910
Any chest pain with any of this?

PATIENT U910
Occasionally.

DOCTOR U910
Occasional.  What is it, is it kind of in the middle of your chest?  Does it go anywhere?  Where do you feel it?

PATIENT U910
It's kind of down in the ribs.

DOCTOR U910
It feels like it down here?  On both sides?

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
Like a tightness or what does it feel like?

PATIENT U910
It's uh, that's why I did the @@@.  It's a, it's almost like the inside, the pain against like my ribs.

DOCTOR U910
Like a pressure?

PATIENT U910
Right.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
And it's there for a while and then it'll subside.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  And how long does it take for it to go away when you stop?

PATIENT U910
A minute or two.

DOCTOR U910
A minute or two.  So it does resolve after you stop and then it kind of goes away?

PATIENT U910
Yes.

DOCTOR U910
Okay and then if you're just sitting and not doing anything else, do you ever feel any symptoms or are you just only when you're moving and exerting yourself?

PATIENT U910
No, no, not that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  Do you, have you noticed more fluid on your legs?

PATIENT U910
Today yeah.

DOCTOR U910
Today or over the last couple months?

PATIENT U910
It's been a couple months.

DOCTOR U910
Over the last couple months okay.  And you're still taking the Lasix twice a day the 40 and 40?  Okay.  Are you still having the same amount of urine output when you take the Lasix?

PATIENT U910
This might sound stupid, and maybe it’s not even possible, I think I’ve developed a kind of…

DOCTOR U910
Like a tolerance.

PATIENT U910
Tolerance.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah that happens sometimes.

PATIENT U910
That's what I was thinking.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT U910
Only sometimes when I really need to go.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
Other times it's like I never took it.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.  Are you eating more salt, salty food?

PATIENT U910
No, no, not really.

DOCTOR U910
Nothing like that.

PATIENT U910
I don't eat salt, I hate salty food.

DOCTOR U910
Okay, okay.  So you're kind of aware of eating more salt makes you swell up more okay.  Do you remember the last time we did like an echo of your heart that's imaging where they do an ultrasound of your heart?  The last one I found was in 2010, do you remember doing anything @@@?

PATIENT U910
Was that where they give @@@ the chest?

DOCTOR U910
No it's, it's just like.

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
It's just like a little machine, an ultrasound machine over your chest.  It's not like an x-ray.

PATIENT U910
I didn't.

DOCTOR U910
@@@ okay and then you had a CABG back in 2001, a open heart surgery and then you had stents placed in 2005 and nothing since then, okay.

PATIENT U910
Nothing since then.

DOCTOR U910
Okay, okay.  Oh in 2007.  You had something since then?

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
@@@ okay.

PATIENT U910
As far as that is because I lost my job and @@@.  I had that done before I lost my job.

DOCTOR U910
Okay and then when you saw DOCTOR in September, in his note now correct me if I'm wrong; he wanted you to cut down your Lasix in half.

PATIENT U910
Right.

DOCTOR U910
What were you taking before?

PATIENT U910
I was taking it twice a day.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
One pill twice a day.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
He wanted me to cut it down.

DOCTOR U910
Yes.

PATIENT U910
I did that.

DOCTOR U910
Did not go well.

PATIENT U910
Did not go well.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
I added.

DOCTOR U910
You added it back okay and then after that you probably felt back to normal and then something happened.

PATIENT U910
Right.

DOCTOR U910
Where it got worse.

PATIENT U910
And now it's, I'm retaining the fluids.

DOCTOR U910
Retaining the fluids okay.  And you said how long exactly this has been going on for?

PATIENT U910
I don’t know, four months, five months I don't know.

DOCTOR U910
Four months, okay so it's been a little while okay.  Um and then your blood pressure, how has that been doing?  Have you been checking it at all at home?

PATIENT U910
Blood pressure, no. But it was taking today.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah it was really good today. I just saw that.  Okay and then your diabetes, what's been going on?  Have you been checking your sugars?

PATIENT U910
I check my sugars.

DOCTOR U910
How we doing?

PATIENT U910
It bounces back and forth.

DOCTOR U910
Yes.

PATIENT U910
@@@ I’m very displeased about that here.

DOCTOR U910
What is that?

PATIENT U910
Uh I don't want anything to do with this whatever @@@ is.  @@@ DOCTOR.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
I'm just.  I get really angry sometimes.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
You know I've been told they were going to send me a letter and I said you can call me on this date.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
And then I get here a half an hour early @@@.

DOCTOR U910
Yes.

PATIENT U910
And then you know, I didn't get called for an hour to an hour and a half later.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
I've got things I got to do and I'm working at night, I got to get some sleep.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
And that really ticks me off.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh did you explain that to her?

PATIENT U910
No I didn't because they tell me I was wrong last time.  She called one day and I didn't have any notice of an appointment.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
Oh just be here, uh-huh.

DOCTOR U910
Hmm.

PATIENT U910
No I didn't.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
And then she thinks @@@ time and its like, look we talk about it here and then she goes and makes a change which I don’t like.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah. Well it's good to let us know if there is a complaint.

PATIENT U910
Well she was planning, and she'd been constantly on this uh I think we need to change you to, the other type of insulin.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  Was it long-acting?  What are you on now?  @@@.

PATIENT U910
I don't know, it's different.  I'm on the long-acting.

DOCTOR U910
You're on the long-acting.

PATIENT U910
Right.

DOCTOR U910
Hmm.  Are you taking more with meals?

PATIENT U910
She wants me to take it at every meal.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
@@@.  Sometimes I get it and other times I'd be eating like five and six times a day.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
That doesn't fit in with my lifestyle at all.

DOCTOR U910
Right.  Okay.

PATIENT U910
So, I'm just a little irritated.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  That’s understandable.  What have your blood sugars been running?

PATIENT U910
They'll go anywhere from 80 to uh about 160.

DOCTOR U910
Okay and when do you check your blood sugars?

PATIENT U910
Usually at night.

DOCTOR U910
Before you go to bed?

PATIENT U910
Before I go to bed.

DOCTOR U910
So that's like morning to you right?

PATIENT U910
That's morning.

DOCTOR U910
Okay so you're sleeping kind of all day and then you wake up, you check it and then you go to work.

PATIENT U910
Right.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  Do you ever check it after you eat a meal?

PATIENT U910
It's rare.

DOCTOR U910
It's rare.  But when you do where are we sitting on that?

PATIENT U910
Oh after a meal I'll shoot up to about in the 200s uh after dinner I'll check it, two hours.  At two hours it might be down to 180 which frequently is the case.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
I don't go back to normal after two hours.  In three hours I'm back.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
Well, what I consider normal, 140 or less.

DOCTOR U910
Right, right.  

PATIENT U910
She doesn't like that 140.

DOCTOR U910
Well um and what are we doing like your maintenance stuff, have you seen the eye doctors in the last year?

PATIENT U910
Yeah, they were okay.

DOCTOR U910
Right and then do you follow with Podiatry or no?  Do you ever have issues with your feet?

PATIENT U910
No, no.

DOCTOR U910
Ulcers or anything like that?

PATIENT U910
No

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  Just make sure you keep an eye out for that stuff just because you know, with neuropathy sometimes you don't feel it in your feet.

PATIENT U910
Oh the other thing I told the nurse when she checked my feet today.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
She mentioned about going barefoot, even in the house and I said well, you got me on that one.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
But uh I have a teensy little nick on the ball of my feet.

DOCTOR U910
Yes.

PATIENT U910
It hurts, for quite a while.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
And our feet are so connected with.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
And I make sure it was going away, heal.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
It took quite a while.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
Maybe two or three weeks just for a little.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
Teeny thing.

DOCTOR U910
And that's what's really concerning because of the diabetes and it's a slow healing process of wounds and a lot of people, unfortunately that have poorly controlled diabetes get a cut like that and that leads to developing like a bone infection and it gets worse and worse and.

PATIENT U910
I keep a close eye on that.

DOCTOR U910
It's very important and if things like you feel are getting all out of hand or a little out of your control then you've got someone to call and we'll get you in to see somebody.

PATIENT U910
What was my record and here's @@@.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
I was told I'll call you and let you know the results and nobody called.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
What my A1c?

DOCTOR U910
The one in earlier April we checked?

PATIENT U910
Correct.

DOCTOR U910
Okay that one was 8.2.

PATIENT U910
Oh then that's pretty high.  @@@ was a lot better than those.

DOCTOR U910
And then the one in January was 8 and then you had 8.6 in August is when I saw you last.

PATIENT U910
I thought it was up in the teens.

DOCTOR U910
And then before that I think you were really up there and then before that, that's when you had a high number.

PATIENT U910
Okay.  But it was 8.2.  Oh the next thing, I got to say this before I forget.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
Uh I had blood work today.

DOCTOR U910
Yes.

PATIENT U910
I just had it on the 6th.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah um she didn't order all the tests that I wanted to see.

PATIENT U910
Oh so you did know I did.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah I did, I did.  I just wanted other, like other tests as well.

PATIENT U910
That's fine.

DOCTOR U910
And then along with that is to check your A1c today.

PATIENT U910
I just. What was it today?

DOCTOR U910
We want to have it here and it was 8.4.  8.4, this is really not that @@@.

PATIENT U910
So I'll just okay, I was curious whether.

DOCTOR U910
So I mean, you know the A1c checks it over three months so checking it @@@ you know.  But like said the more recent A1c we have the more we can then make changes to your medications.

PATIENT U910
Well it’s supposed to go 6 or below.

DOCTOR U910
7 or below is my goal for you to have.  I think 6 or below um I was, with 6.5 or below you'd be technically not diabetic but for a diabetic I want you below 7 and ideally around 6.5 but that would be our target.

PATIENT U910
I think the main problem is my weight.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah so.

PATIENT U910
But I can't lose it.

DOCTOR U910
Well I know you work late so it's hard uh.  Yeah this is back in like 2010 you were like 12.7 and you were like 9.8 and then we kind of hung around the 8 region for a long time and that's why they sent you to the Pharm D @@@.  So tell me what, I know it's hard for you to gauge it so what is your diet usually consist of?  Do you know what's healthy to eat and what's not healthy to eat for diabetes?

PATIENT U910
Yeah.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
Stay away from carbs.

DOCTOR U910
That’s the first step.

PATIENT U910
Stay away from carbs, starches, greasy.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
And the sugar.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.  Definitely.  You know okay so that's like one step and then I know you're kind of on the go it seems like.  Are you usually eat out most of the time?

PATIENT U910
I've been more lately.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
But even then it's not always bad, well what I get it'll still be fast food but you know I'll have a fish sandwich, @@@.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
Tuna.  @@@.  I cook up a lot of chicken and it lasts for three or four days.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
What time is your biggest meal usually?

PATIENT U910
Right about now.

DOCTOR U910
Right about now okay and that's when you're like getting home from work?

PATIENT U910
Right.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
But the thing I can't do without is, the uh, kinda like, @@@ instant mashed potatoes.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah that you make pretty quickly, yeah.  Do you remember the last time we did a stress test on you?

PATIENT U910
You haven't that I know of.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
But that's in the @@@.

DOCTOR U910
Why is that?

PATIENT U910
That's last time I had one.

DOCTOR U910
Oh my goodness.

PATIENT U910
I even remember when I it was.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
It’s been quite a while.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.  Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
And I only lasted like 30 seconds.

DOCTOR U910
Okay, but did you get the treadmill?  You got a treadmill?

PATIENT U910
Yeah.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
They started me on the main going a high speed.

DOCTOR U910
Right.  We don't, we don't have to do a treadmill, we could do like where we give you a medication and that's your stress test.  What I mean it stresses your heart enough to maybe push it and we monitor it.  People that can't get up on a treadmill and run we have other ways to do the stress test.

PATIENT U910
That's fine.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.  That’s what I’m saying.

PATIENT U910
And I just can't do it because of the pain in my legs.

DOCTOR U910
Yes.  So I don't think your treadmill was here.  @@@.

PATIENT U910
@@@.  As a matter of fact I'm pretty sure it was before I had the last stent.

DOCTOR U910
Oh okay.

PATIENT U910
Cause I tried to talk the doctor out of doing it.  I said look, it’s a waste of time.

DOCTOR U910
Okay and then do you also, did you get your Lasix when you saw him.  You stopped the niacin and the Zetia.  Did you stop those two?

PATIENT U910
Yes.

DOCTOR U910
Okay but the Lasix you kind of went back to that.

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
What were you having, you were just swelling more or short of breath or what?

PATIENT U910
Both.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
Mainly the shortness of breath because I could feel the fluid, feel the fluid in my lungs.

DOCTOR U910
Okay, yeah.  That’s uncomfortable.

PATIENT U910
Is it a different type?  Right now I'm taking Lasix that I had.  @@@.  Might be generic.

DOCTOR U910
Oh the furosemide.

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
Yes.

PATIENT U910
Is there a difference?

DOCTOR U910
There isn't but we have room to go up on your Lasix, you have a lot of room.  The max dose of Lasix is like 400 a day @@@.  So what we could do is I'll talk to DOCTOR and see what her plan is but I would probably want to get you an echo and see how much your cardiac function has changed.  I'd probably get an ultrasound of your heart.

PATIENT U910
Okay.

DOCTOR U910
Um I'd maybe do a stress test on you too.  I'll see what she has to say about it and I'd definitely increase your Lasix, at least for now because you've become symptomatic so we need to figure out what's going on okay.  But let me just type in a couple of notes to get the ball rolling.  And then do you need refills on any medications do you know?

PATIENT U910
When I was getting, write it down, uh let's see.  Carvedilol expires, I got five left until August.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
That’s Plavix.

PATIENT U910
Cause I've only got one refill left.

DOCTOR U910
Okay I'll refill that one too.

PATIENT U910
Furosemide I got three refills left.  Glipizide only one.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  What are you on for glipizide is it 10?

PATIENT U910
I take two tablets by mouth twice a day.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  And you're on the max dose of that.

PATIENT U910
10 mg.

DOCTOR U910
I'll refill that one.

PATIENT U910
Uh insulin two refills left before July.

DOCTOR U910
Okay I've got the metformin.

PATIENT U910
Metformin three refills left before July.

DOCTOR U910
@@@.  And you're still taking the rosuvastatin, that's for the cholesterol?

PATIENT U910
Correct.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  And that's going okay, no muscles aches or pains or anything?

PATIENT U910
No nothing.  How's the @@@ these days?  Did you get me the statins?

DOCTOR U910
Oh yeah I did.  We'll go over that @@@.

PATIENT U910
And I do have one other unrelated question.

DOCTOR U910
Yes, we’ll address them all. The Lasix, let's see maybe we'll go 60 twice a day.  Do you have 20 mg tablets or are they 40's?

PATIENT U910
Uh.

DOCTOR U910
Do you take just one pill or do you take two pills in the morning.

PATIENT U910
It's one twice a day.

DOCTOR U910
Just one pill okay.

PATIENT U910
I take one.

DOCTOR U910
@@@.

PATIENT U910
So take two of them twice?

DOCTOR U910
Yeah I'll let you know a final decision, we'll write everything down.

PATIENT U910
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR U910
Okay so, let's go over your labs.  The A1c we talked about before.  This is your white blood cell count.  Your hemoglobin here is 14.5 that's normal for a male your age.  Um your white blood cell count is 9 and that's a sign of infection.  Um your platelet count is 193 and that's also elevated.  This is your electrolyte count and also your kidney functions and your cholesterol levels.  So this is what I wanted.  I wanted to check your cholesterol and your liver enzymes since you were on statins a long time, so we check like your liver so I wanted to make sure nothing was going on with that.  Okay so your electrolytes, your potassium is actually a little bit low and that's probably from your Lasix so what we'll probably have to do is give you some potassium tablets to take.

PATIENT U910
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U910
Cause if that drops too low your heart can go into like arrhythmias it's just @@@.  So that's why we do that um, this is a test of your kidney function and it was 1.08 and that's kind of in your baseline so your kidney function is kind of in the normal range.  Your urea nitrogen is your BUN.  It's another measurement of your kidneys um but that was consistent for you.  Let's see you were 6.7, nothing has changed and that's kind of what we look for in the test.

PATIENT U910
But is is high.

DOCTOR U910
It is high.  Minimally at high risk um and then the magnesium this is another one that is concerns me. So your potassium and your magnesium are two electrolytes that are very important to watch.  Your magnesium is also low.  So we'll probably have to start you on supplements and I may even want to give you some IV stuff here today before you go home and I know you're tired and you want to go home and sleep.

PATIENT U910
I want to eat.

DOCTOR U910
@@@.  And then these are your triglycerides so those are the fats.  So that's what you were taking niacin for @@@.  Yeah you were much better @@@ on the niacin.  Do you know why she didn't want you on it?  No.

PATIENT U910
I don't know.

DOCTOR U910
No? Were you tolerating it okay?  You weren't getting real hot or night sweats.

PATIENT U910
Didn’t get a flash, rashes or itches.

DOCTOR U910
Well I would probably restart that for you, if that's okay with you.

PATIENT U910
It's okay with me.

DOCTOR U910
Those numbers, I think I don't like this number.  I definitely want you like closer to 200 and also @@@, let's just do that.  So I @@@.

PATIENT U910
It wasn't just the niacin, what was the Zetia for?

DOCTOR U910
So Zetia is also kind of a affects your of cholesterol um and your fats.

PATIENT U910
Triglycerides.

DOCTOR U910
Yes.

PATIENT U910
Because I was controlled with triglycerides under the doctor before.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
Uh and he specifically put me on those to get the triglycerides down.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.  So the only problem with Zetia is that like they haven't really proven that it does a lot, like it maybe minimally helps with your triglycerides.  It also causes a lot of GI upset.  So I would prefer we would start back on the niacin first and you know test this in like three months and see if it's helping.  If that's not helping, then we can add back the Zetia but with the side effects I'd rather you just do the niacin if you tolerate that well if it controls it.  Okay.

PATIENT U910
That’s fine. I've never had any side effects on any of the medications.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah, that's good.  Your medicines.  Your cholesterol.  So there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol.

PATIENT U910
The good is always low.

DOCTOR U910
Your good cholesterol is the HDL and the niacin also helps with that actually.  It'll help bring it up just a little bit but the way you get your HDL up is exercise.  Physical exercise, which I know right now is kind of hard because of what’s going on but your LDL @@@ good. That’s great we want you below 70; you're at 58, that's excellent.  You’re diabetic with heart disease and we want you below 70 for your bad cholesterol.  So the LDL is where we want it.  The HDL is a little bit low um, we'll work on kind of symptomatically relieving your issues so you can do a little more exercise but we mainly covered that.  Your @@@ are your liver function tests, all the liver functions, but these usually @@@ when you're on a statin and then they'll @@@.  

PATIENT U910
@@@ high?

DOCTOR U910
No that's low, 0.4 is low.  4 is high it looks like you've never had levels that high @@@ around that range.  Yeah you've even down from the last @@@.  So @@@ go back on niacin.  Do you want to do a 90-day supply or do you want a 30-day supply?

PATIENT U910
90 is fine. That will be sent?

DOCTOR U910
Yes sent in the mail.  Okay let me just uh examine you and then we'll come up with a game plan and I'll write everything down for you.  Where do you work security?

PATIENT U910
I work uh in Burr Ridge.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  That's @@@ right yeah.

PATIENT U910
Right.  South.  About.

DOCTOR U910
Take a deep breath.

PATIENT U910
About 17 miles I guess.

DOCTOR U910
Oh okay.  Do you live there too?

PATIENT U910
Yeah.  @@@ North @@@.

DOCTOR U910
Just look straight ahead for me I just want to check your eyes first.  Open up wide for me, say ah.

PATIENT U910
Ah.

DOCTOR U910
Okay. Perfect. Can I have you hold your breath for a minute?  Okay perfect.  Deep breath for me.  So are some days worse than others?  Is today probably a good day for you?  I don't hear much fluid in your lungs.

PATIENT U910
Oh no, as far as that goes, it’s a good day.

DOCTOR U910
So with the exertion the shortness of breath you're getting.

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah, yeah. Today wasn’t as bad. Is it days on days off kind of a thing @@@.

PATIENT U910
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  But you said you've noticed more fluid huh?

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
And that's the way you can.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
You know it's not down in my feet, it's always there.

DOCTOR U910
Here.  @@@ all right here.  You can tell that by pushing down and if it leaves an indent.  You usually don't have that.

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
The swelling.

PATIENT U910
Yeah, that's what I've been having for about.

DOCTOR U910
For the last four months.  But before I'm saying you didn't have any fluid on there, okay.  Wonderful.  Check this side.

PATIENT U910
Since @@@.

DOCTOR U910
Why is this one red?  Is it where they took the veins for your surgery, do you know?

PATIENT U910
Uh.

DOCTOR U910
When they do cardiac surgery sometimes they take a vein from your legs for the graft, do you remember?

PATIENT U910
I don't remember.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah a lot of people are like that.  Okay, uh just have a seat right there.  I'm going to talk to DOCTOR.  I'll be back in just a couple minutes okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  58:14  DOCTOR IN:  69:09)

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  So we've come up with a game plan.  Do you have that little med sheet they gave you when you came in, let’s write down on that, then you can keep that and I'll take this one okay.  So I'm just going to write on the back of this one if that's okay.  So we'll do the changes.  We're going to do your Lasix, we're going to do 60 mg twice a day.  You can cut your pills in half; do you have a pill cutter?

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
Oh okay that's fine too yeah so just cut them in half until you get the new ones.  The new ones will probably just be 20's and you'll take three.

PATIENT U910
What am I taking?

DOCTOR U910
You're taking 40 mg twice a day.

PATIENT U910
Okay.

DOCTOR U910
Now it's going to be 60.

PATIENT U910
So 1 1/2 okay.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah it goes to 1 1/2.  Um and then we're starting the niacin, okay, and then I'm starting you on some potassium.  Your potassium and magnesium are low.  I'm not going to make an IV I know you want to go home and sleep but I want you to take so we're going to give you magnesium it's going to be 420 mg three times daily.

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
For one week yeah and then you just take it twice a day.

PATIENT U910
Three times a day for a week.

DOCTOR U910
Just one week and then after that just take it twice a day and then potassium, that's potassium chloride and that's 20 mg and you'll take that twice daily.  So we're increasing your Lasix, your potassium @@@.

PATIENT U910
What's the difference, just out of curiosity?

DOCTOR U910
Sure.

PATIENT U910
This is salt isn't it?

DOCTOR U910
No.

PATIENT U910
It's not.

DOCTOR U910
Sodium is salt.

PATIENT U910
Oh.

DOCTOR U910
Right, potassium is something else yeah.

PATIENT U910
Okay.

DOCTOR U910
It's another electrolyte.  It's like inside of your cells, it's the thing it has the most of is potassium.

PATIENT U910
Okay.

DOCTOR U910
And it stabilizes your cardiac membranes if you have enough potassium.  It if doesn't then you can have like arrhythmias and that's probably not good for your heart @@@.

PATIENT U910
Yeah and when you were checking me I could feel, I could feel the heart.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
Doing weird stuff in there.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah, yeah.  So we'll keep an eye on that stuff.  We'll do the electrolytes and that might help.  If you continue to feel like palpitations and stuff like that then we can put you on a Holter monitor.  It hooks up to you and kind of watches your rhythm for a little while but we'll adjust that when we cross that bridge.  Um and I'm gonna schedule you to see Cardiology.  Cardiology appointment they'll schedule you when you're leaving just take the next available if you can.  We're gonna do an echo. That's an ultrasound of your heart and that'll tell us how much your blood is pumping, your ejection fraction I don't know if you've heard that before so you know.  If it's low.

PATIENT U910
I don't remember when I had it but the last time I had it, it was not this cardiologist, the one before.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
Had me do it and @@@.

DOCTOR U910
Your ejection fraction was low.  It was 40% at that time.

PATIENT U910
Yeah.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah.

PATIENT U910
And he said he was a little concerned about it, but not.

DOCTOR U910
Right so if it's, on this echo so if you're a lot worse then we would worry and would probably send you to do a stress test.  But I would do the chemical one for you so the treadmill wouldn't be an issue okay.  We want to see how your heart's doing when it's under stress.

PATIENT U910
Okay.

DOCTOR U910
And if your echo looks find and I'll call you when I get the results.  It might take like a week to kind of get that back so uh if your echo looks fine then I wouldn't worry, then we'll just do the Lasix dosing and then we'll see how you do.

PATIENT U910
So when am I doing this echo?

DOCTOR U910
It's going to be scheduled.  When you check out they'll schedule you.

PATIENT U910
Okay.

DOCTOR U910
Uh and then I want you to come back for labs in one week.

PATIENT U910
Again?

DOCTOR U910
Yes.  I want to make sure your potassium and magnesium are coming back to normal.  I don't want to stress your heart any more than we have to, so it's really important.

PATIENT U910
Well I've got to get this today then.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah do you want to pick those up downstairs?

PATIENT U910
I can.

DOCTOR U910
I'd prefer you do.  I know you want to go home and sleep but I'd prefer you just pick them up.  Especially because they're new, let me just sign this and get all this stuff ordered and then I want you to see, I know you don’t like the Pharm D and that didn't work out and that's totally fine.  I want to actually see an endocrinologist.  They manage diabetes a lot better.

PATIENT U910
Than this.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah so, we'll set you up with one.

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
Let's just go to endocrine, your A1c has been 8 for like a while so we're not really making headway so.  Endocrinology means like the doctors look at the glands in your body and the pancreas is like a gland so they deal with it a lot so they're very good.  Okay, is this pretty clear?

PATIENT U910
Yeah.  Furosemide 1 1/2 twice a day.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
Start the niacin, start the, restart the niacin.

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.

PATIENT U910
Magnesium, new one three times a day.

DOCTOR U910
You can restart it whenever you get it, it's not.

PATIENT U910
Oh okay.

DOCTOR U910
You know it's not urgent you start it today.

PATIENT U910
Magnesium, potassium start today or tonight.  Magnesium three times a day for a week then twice a day and potassium chloride twice a day, Cardiology appointment, echo appointment, labs in one week.  @@@. Yeah, good.

DOCTOR U910
Okay wonderful.  Okay so I ordered those two for the windows so they should be there um and those other two I ordered the niacin, I ordered your echo.

PATIENT U910
And endo, Cardiology, do the echo and endocrinologist but they, you just ordered the echo right?

DOCTOR U910
Uh-huh.  But they'll have to schedule you. I have no control over when they’ll schedule you and if things get worse I want you to call and if they tell you come in for an @@ visit I want you to do that.  That means we're going to take @@@.  Even if you don't see me you need to be seen by somebody.  I don't want you to go through or suffer for three months before somebody sees you, do you know what I mean?  Usually, they'll be able to get you in with me but if they don't.

PATIENT U910
Don't close out.

DOCTOR U910
Don't close out?

PATIENT U910
Don’t close out, I got another question.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
Just one.

DOCTOR U910
Hmm.  Okay and then when are you due to see the eye people again?  September okay, next September.  

PATIENT U910
Well I'm still confused if the furosemide, at least to me doesn't seem like its working then why am I depleting my potassium and magnesium?

DOCTOR U910
Because it's still making you urinate and potassium and Lasix actually wastes potassium.  So even if you're on a low dose sometimes people can be wasting potassium.  Some people are sensitive to it differently um because the higher you go on a dosage the more potassium you're gonna lose so that's why it's important.  So no matter how much Lasix you're going to lose potassium.  Some people their bodies adjust to it and they kind of you know just absorb more potassium and your body kind of regulates itself but when you're on a higher dose of it it can't keep up and so you're better just to take oral.  It's not uncommon.

PATIENT U910
No @@@.  What foods might include?

DOCTOR U910
Bananas, very high in potassium.

PATIENT U910
Oh good I like bananas.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah eat a banana every morning if you can or every night whenever you're going to work.  Okay, what was the other questions?

PATIENT U910
Oh yeah I see on TV and I also see you have the documentation out here in the Waiting Room.

DOCTOR U910
Yes.

PATIENT U910
Should I get that?

DOCTOR U910
The shingles.  So you are 62, so we recommend vaccination usually around you know after 60.  Um have you had the chicken pox as a child?  You have okay.  Do you know what shingles is? 

PATIENT U910
I guess it's some sort of a neuro…herpes.

DOCTOR U910
Yeah @@@.  Exactly it's a herpes @@@ so.  Chicken pox is a herpes virus.  You get chicken pox and you break out everywhere and it goes away but it actually stays in your body, it's dormant and then one day when you're older and your immune system's down and especially if you're a diabetic sometimes.

PATIENT U910
That's why…

DOCTOR U910
@@@ it can flare, it can flare-up and then when it flares up it kind of is like, it flares up like in a distribution of one side of your body.

PATIENT U910
I've seen it.

DOCTOR U910
And it's like pretty, it's pretty painful.  

PATIENT U910
Yeah.

DOCTOR U910
Some people sometimes can have residual neuropathy so I mean if you're not adverse to getting it we'll do it today.

PATIENT U910
That fine.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.

PATIENT U910
That's what I wanted to know.

DOCTOR U910
Sure, sure.

PATIENT U910
If you recommended it.

DOCTOR U910
It's a great thought; it's a great thought yeah.

PATIENT U910
I don't need any more pain.

DOCTOR U910
Okay, let's walk you out.  Okay so labs in a week okay.

PATIENT U910
Okay.

DOCTOR U910
I think we have everything all set.  I want you to come back to see me in a little shorter interval this time is that okay?

PATIENT U910
Sure.

DOCTOR U910
Okay.  So we'll see you in two months.  That's to check your cardiac enzymes.

PATIENT U910
Are you getting close to leaving?

DOCTOR U910
No I'm just starting so you'll see me in two months.

PATIENT U910
Does it take that long?

DOCTOR U910
Yeah three years @@@.

PATIENT U910
@@@.

DOCTOR U910
So I've got two more.  So we'll get to know each other a lot better.  @@@ workout and then I'll take a look at your lab and I'll call you when we get the echo, the labs in a couple of weeks.  Thank you.  Take care sir.
