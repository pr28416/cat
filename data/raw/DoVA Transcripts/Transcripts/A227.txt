DOCTOR A227
Good, alright.  It's been a while since we've seen you by the way.

PATIENT A227
@@@ came in here not long ago I was having um breathing problems the last time.

DOCTOR A227
That's right in late October right.

PATIENT A227
Right.

DOCTOR A227
Um how has that been for you?

PATIENT A227
It's been going really good.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
I haven't had no problems.

DOCTOR A227
No more breathing problems now.

PATIENT A227
No.

DOCTOR A227
Okay, I'm going to pull up your chart for a moment.  Alright.  Okay when you were driving one time, you felt real lightheaded?

PATIENT A227
Light yes.

DOCTOR A227
So a couple of things um, looks like your pressure's a little bit high.

PATIENT A227
Yeah that might be from, you know I woke up this morning with the intentions of doing other things.

DOCTOR A227
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A227
And then it dawned on me that I had a doctor's appointment like around 7:30.

DOCTOR A227
Uh-huh okay.

PATIENT A227
Then I had to drop everything.

DOCTOR A227
Oh sure.

PATIENT A227
That I had planned to do this morning.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
And try to come out here to you know be on time at 8:30.

DOCTOR A227
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A227
So I really have been rushing.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
Since I got up this morning and that may have contributed to my, you know blood pressure being so high.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
I hope that's it.

DOCTOR A227
I want to see, I'm just trying to take a quick look and see you don’t have any other trouble with high blood pressure in the past.  Um well um @@@ a couple of things um, did you get the flu shot yet this year, a regular flu shot?
 
PATIENT A227
No I didn't.

DOCTOR A227
Okay would you like one today?

PATIENT A227
Uh not today.

DOCTOR A227
Today okay.  Will you come back for one?

PATIENT A227
Yes.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.  Your blood pressure has been high in the past, though, these last couple of times. I’ll check it again, we’ll have you sit up there.  Do you have any trouble.

PATIENT A227
Say um you know if it does seen a little high, I would like to get a chance to bring it down myself.

DOCTOR A227
Oh yeah.

PATIENT A227
Okay.  

DOCTOR A227
Cause it doesn't look like you've had high blood pressures before this last time when you were having trouble breathing.@@@

PATIENT A227
Okay.

DOCTOR A227
Any pains anywhere, any stiffness?

PATIENT A227
No, I'm feeling great.

DOCTOR A227
You're feeling good alright, alright.

PATIENT A227
Feeling great.

DOCTOR A227
Alright.

PATIENT A227
No I had a hip replacement and I think I got a follow-up on that on the 30th.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
And uh like I was telling the receptionist out there I've got to, I got two appointments on the 30th but I need to cancel one of them out.

DOCTOR A227
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A227
So he said I can call in.

DOCTOR A227
Yeah.

PATIENT A227
And set another date for one of them.

DOCTOR A227
Hmm, let's see okay.  And @@@ anything else for you.  @@@ I just want to make sure you have all your medicine, @@@.  It looks like your cholesterol is a little high.

PATIENT A227
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A227
Back in July.

PATIENT A227
Right.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.  So are you on any medication for that or?

PATIENT A227
None at all, none at all.  I try to stay active, doing things.  Trying to keep from @@@ going on medications.

DOCTOR A227
Oh definitely, um I think the only thing that we need @@@.

PATIENT A227
Uh DOCTOR mentioned that.

DOCTOR A227
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A227
At one point uh it might be time for me to go get a colonoscopy again.

DOCTOR A227
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A227
But that was because I think what like three years ago I went through it and I had polyps then and I guess I kind of wasn't rushing to go through it again.

DOCTOR A227
I know.  It's not the most pleasant kind of thing to do.

PATIENT A227
Well, um somewhere toward the you know first of next year.

DOCTOR A227
We can do that.

PATIENT A227
Okay.

DOCTOR A227
We can get that you know um started on you know.  I can go ahead and just put the order in the system.  They're not going to schedule you until after the first of the year.

PATIENT A227
Right.

DOCTOR A227
So what we can do is get it set up and get the ball rolling on on that. I can get you into the class again, kind of um like back in @@@ when you had it and um @@@ have you go to the class again, get the medicines.  So @@@ a few months.

PATIENT A227
Oh okay.

DOCTOR A227
Yeah.  So that's why we mention it to you know so we can get that started.

PATIENT A227
Okay.

DOCTOR A227
How's this?

PATIENT A227
Yeah.

DOCTOR A227
Any chest pain, trouble getting around?

PATIENT A227
No.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
No, no.

DOCTOR A227
Alright.  Hop on there, relax your arm and I'm going to take your blood pressure again.  Just give me your arm.

PATIENT A227
Okay.

DOCTOR A227
You guys talked about the MRI right?  Of your brain where they found old strokes?

PATIENT A227
Right, right.  DOCTOR mentioned that to me.

DOCTOR A227
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A227
When we went through it before and then he said something about how he was going to recheck and I was gonna get a phone call and then he recommended I go through a follow-up to make sure that everything's still.

DOCTOR A227
@@@ a couple of things that um can cause the strokes and things like that.  High blood pressure and high cholesterol um so point where they actually found your strokes suggests that it could actually be a blood pressure thing more than the cholesterol.  The location of them, typically more @@@ with um high blood pressure.  So give me one second. Relax your arm. It's not as high as it was before.  @@@.  So it's coming down but it's still high um.  I'd like to check with DOCTOR cause one of the things is having the history of strokes that they found on the MRI we'd like to – our recommendation would be to keep it – the blood pressure a little lower. Just because that’s the way to prevent future occurrences.  Um some of the things that um can help in terms of uh you know things you can to help keep your blood pressure under control is to try to avoid as much salt as you can.  Unfortunately a lot of the canned food and um things that come in packages have a lot of salt um, things that people get a restaurant often have a lot of salt because that’s what makes it taste good.

PATIENT A227
Right, right.

DOCTOR A227
You know um but if you're going to buy – I don’t know who does the cooking in the house.

PATIENT A227
Um.

DOCTOR A227
Who does you?

PATIENT A227
Mostly.

DOCTOR A227
You mostly do it?

PATIENT A227
Yeah.

DOCTOR A227
So getting @@@ sodium content um.  Try to use a little bit less, or when you’re cooking, don’t use as much salt but @@@.  I know it’s not going to taste as great when you're doing that but it can definitely help in terms of um lowering your blood pressure.

PATIENT A227
Okay.

DOCTOR A227
Un give me some nice deep breaths.  Excellent.  @@@ Breathe normal.

PATIENT A227
Oh, normal.

DOCTOR A227
@@@.  And you're walking around no problems?

PATIENT A227
No.  I think one of the things that caused this sleeping problem the last time.

DOCTOR A227
Yeah.

PATIENT A227
I had taken a lot of vitamin pills cause I was coming down with a cold.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
And @@@ take a five vitamin pills.

DOCTOR A227
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A227
The first time you take them you take four, the next time three, the next time you know two.

DOCTOR A227
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A227
And then you come down to taking one.

DOCTOR A227
That's interesting.  I don't know maybe.

PATIENT A227
If that you know.

DOCTOR A227
I actually haven't heard of that um but you know it's hard cause we don't really have a good idea of what with the cold and stuff what do to.  Um sometimes one of the things that some people say that helps and has actually been studied is zinc, you know like over the counter zinc.

PATIENT A227
Zinc.

DOCTOR A227
So uh-huh, so it's some people if you take it early, like when you first feel a sore throat coming on within 24 hours or something like that, sometimes it kind of shortens the duration of the cold.

PATIENT A227
Okay.

DOCTOR A227
That's the only thing that's been actually like scientifically studied to really really help.  Mostly other things in terms they just kind of help the symptoms, the runny noses you know and the cough syrup and things like that.

PATIENT A227
Yeah.

DOCTOR A227
Ultimately its our immune systems.

PATIENT A227
It just has to wear itself off.

DOCTOR A227
Yeah, yeah.  But sometimes @@@ there is a study that says that zinc you know like will shorten the duration if you get it early enough.

PATIENT A227
Okay.

DOCTOR A227
That's what they say.  That's the only thing I know.

PATIENT A227
Yeah.

DOCTOR A227
So um.

PATIENT A227
Okay, @@@ something.

DOCTOR A227
Oh okay well.

PATIENT A227
That's uh; don't have no kind of degree behind their name or anything like that.

DOCTOR A227
That's okay, it's you know.

PATIENT A227
You people seem to say different stuff like that.

DOCTOR A227
Whatever you know whatever works for you, I'm glad you're not coughing anymore.  Um yeah.  I think and you saw the eye doctors.  So if you know the concern that I have is you may and I know you don't want to take any medicines and you know you want to work on the blood pressure yourself.  Um I'd like to.

PATIENT A227
I’m going to say,you know I have an idea why my blood pressure is high today.

DOCTOR A227
Uh-huh okay.

PATIENT A227
Because I got one of those little monitors at home.

DOCTOR A227
Oh you do good.

PATIENT A227
Yeah so that's I take it from time to time and I just haven’t, I haven't used it in the past.

DOCTOR A227
That okay.

PATIENT A227
About a week.

DOCTOR A227
Sure um why don't we do this, if you have a monitor at home which is like perfect, exactly kind of what I was going for, let's and you come back when again?

PATIENT A227
@@@.

DOCTOR A227
Just you have another appointment?

PATIENT A227
Probably about another week.

DOCTOR A227
Another week okay, let's do this, let me see if we can get you scheduled for the pharmacist, to see the pharmacist which is a little bit easier to get in to to see them.  I want you to take your blood pressure @@@ every day in the morning at the same time or whatever and for a week until you see the pharmacist and then you can make a log of what your blood pressure's have been doing and then if they're still running high then maybe consider starting a medication, at a really low dose that’s a once a day thing.  But only if it's high but if your logs shows you know that everything's okay and you know its low and all that stuff then you won't need anything to help it.  Does that sound like a good plan?

PATIENT A227
Sounds good.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
That's good.  That's good.  Um I'm going to schedule an appointment to see the orthopedist. 

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
I am scheduled for the 30th and I have a court appearance on the 30ths as well.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
Same time, 9:30.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
And I'm going to call them up.

DOCTOR A227
Reschedule.

PATIENT A227
And reschedule to see them and if I could work it out where I could come out.

DOCTOR A227
The same day to see the pharmacist

PATIENT A227
Yeah.

DOCTOR A227
@@@ yep that's fine.  We'll try to get that taken care of.  Give me one second.

PATIENT A227
Oh.

DOCTOR A227
Let me just talk to DOCTOR real quick.

PATIENT A227
Okay.

DOCTOR A227
Alright and I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  42:49  DOCTOR IN:  48:25)

DOCTOR A227
Okie doke.  Uh DOCTOR agreed we'll have you try the home monitoring for a little while and so you know bring in the sheet and then see the pharmacist and at that time if we do need to start the medicines then we will recommend it. 

PATIENT A227
Right.

DOCTOR A227
Yeah and the only reason we're doing that is because you have had a the old strokes that we saw on the head scan and we just want to make sure that that doesn’t happen again, okay.  So does that sound like a plan?

PATIENT A227
Yeah.

DOCTOR A227
Cause otherwise you know we'll just let it be but the problem with high blood pressure is it can do damage to other parts.  Okay.  That's it.  You can go give this to the receptionist.

PATIENT A227
Oh okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR A227
And so and then they'll mail you a letter about the colonoscopy screening and all of that, like they did last time.

PATIENT A227
Oh okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR A227
And I'm going to give you a form, let me see.

PATIENT A227
I just got to work on trying to quit salt to bring it down.

DOCTOR A227
Low salt.

PATIENT A227
Low salt.

DOCTOR A227
Low salt.

PATIENT A227
Okay.  @@@, that's a problem.

DOCTOR A227
Yep we don't want you to have a stroke cause that happened to one of my patients just two months ago and it was kind of sad because now he has to walk with a cane and I don't you know so.

PATIENT A227
Oh no.

DOCTOR A227
Yeah exactly especially with your history of hip replacement and all those things you know.

PATIENT A227
Yeah.

DOCTOR A227
We can't replace some of those, @@@ brain.

PATIENT A227
Exactly.  So I'll call up, I'm going to call the Ortho and reschedule.

DOCTOR A227
They may be able to do this, actually do it right at the front.  You can have them see if there's another time @@@ pharmacist in two weeks @@@ same day as pharma.

PATIENT A227
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A227
Here's the form.  Okay and I'll see you in three to four months @@@.  Okay and then @@@.

PATIENT A227
Okay.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.

PATIENT A227
Okay thank you so much.

DOCTOR A227
Okay.  Take care PATIENT.

PATIENT A227
Okay.

DOCTOR A227
@@@.

PATIENT A227
