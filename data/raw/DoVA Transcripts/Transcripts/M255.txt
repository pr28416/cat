Well its firm and what I'm trying to say is that I don't think there's a bunch of pus down there.

PATIENT M255

PATIENT M255
I squeezed it, I squeezed it.

PATIENT M255
I have hepatitis C yeah.

DOCTOR M255
Hepatitis C.

PATIENT M255
Yeah, yeah, could that be involved?

DOCTOR M255
I don’t know.  Um I'm just trying to see if your immune system's intact.  Um you don't have any immune, you don't take steroids or anything?

PATIENT M255
Uh uh, nope.

DOCTOR M255
I think we can give you the same antibiotic for you.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
I think we are going to give you an antibiotic and I think it'll help clear it up.  You can, I don't know if we have uh, so basically what we found when you were admitted to the hospital, we do like those nasal swabs. Do you ever remember getting the nasal swabs?

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
You have a bug that grows in there called methicillin-resistant Staph aureus.  You've heard about Staph infection?

PATIENT M255
Uh uh.

DOCTOR M255
Uh it's the type of bacteria that grows on all our skin.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
Okay and you can get a folliculitis, which means the follicle, the hair follicle is infected.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
And usually your body deals with it, you know like a zit.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
You know uh when you get a zit or a pimple, that's an infected little, you know I've got one forming here.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
Or here's an old one.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
You got an old one here.

PATIENT M255
Yeah.

DOCTOR M255
And you can probably see @@@.

PATIENT M255
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR M255
Yeah right here and right here.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR M255
Those are little bitty like inflammations and your body usually deals with it.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
Sometimes though we can get an ingrown hair.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
Follicle that can get stuck, trapped in there like that pus.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
And it's a little stronger infection okay.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
And you have a bug in your body, not everyone has it, some people have it and if it's in your nose we say it's colonized.  You know, it's just these bacteria grow they don't cause infection for you most of the time.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
You may have a little bit of an infection with skin flow which could be this resistant bug called MRSA.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
In which case we can give you an antibiotic which will help clear it.  If you want to get rid of the bug entirely you can do this Decolonization Clinic, I don't think we have it here at the VA though.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
You'd have to go to a private hospital to get that done.

PATIENT M255
What was that called?

DOCTOR M255
It's like a Decolonization MRSA Clinic.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh okay.

DOCTOR M255
They have one at Loyola but I don't know, I don't know what the options are for veterans.

PATIENT M255
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M255
Um I'll go and ask what my attending what they think but I think if we give you an antibiotic for that we can clear that up okay.

PATIENT M255
Okay.  Hey doc another things man, could write me a prescription now for some smoke patches?

DOCTOR M255
Uh nicotine patches?

PATIENT M255
