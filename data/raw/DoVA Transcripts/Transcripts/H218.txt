PATIENT H218
Continuously.

DOCTOR H218
@@@ more times than I can tell.

PATIENT H218
Right.

DOCTOR H218
Alright so since the last time you saw us, about a year ago, a few things have happened right.  You've had surgery up here.  You got surgery on your foot.  You had that cardiac catheterization done.

PATIENT H218
That's right.

DOCTOR H218
You were seen at Hines, you're like uh we'll just manage you with your medicines right, is that what they decided?

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H218
Okay and then recently you were just hospitalized because you were having nausea and vomiting.

PATIENT H218
Yeah.

DOCTOR H218
So @@@.

PATIENT H218
And also I had uh amputation.

DOCTOR H218
Yep, yep.  That's a lot, that's enough for you.

PATIENT H218
Yeah.

DOCTOR H218
You don't get any more for the rest of the year.

PATIENT H218
(Laughter)

DOCTOR H218
Um how are you, how's the nausea and the vomiting?

PATIENT H218
Um right now it's relatively cool.  I haven't had much of it.

DOCTOR H218
Okay.  Um those pills they sent you home with, that Reglan and metoclopramide, it's that one you take before you eat, is that helping?

PATIENT H218
I don't know tell me.  I mean I take the medicine so maybe it is.

DOCTOR H218
So it is cause it's not coming back right.

PATIENT H218
Right.

DOCTOR H218
We just keep going with it okay.  We don't want to mess up a good thing alright, okay.  And then that other stomach acid medicine, the ranitidine, has that been helping you?

PATIENT H218
That's the one for the gut?

DOCTOR H218
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON H218
No the gut is the one you take before the meal.

DOCTOR H218
Okay.  The other one is uh.

SECOND PERSON H218
It's that half a pill that you take.

DOCTOR H218
Twice a day?

SECOND PERSON H218
Twice a day for the stomach.

DOCTOR H218
Okay, okay.

SECOND PERSON H218
So he's been taking that.

DOCTOR H218
Okay.  So tell me what you're taking for your diabetes?

PATIENT H218
Uh 10 cc.

DOCTOR H218
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H218
Every evening.

DOCTOR H218
Okay and do you check your sugars?

PATIENT H218
Every now and then.

DOCTOR H218
Okay.  So um I would like for you to check your sugars more regularly.  Anytime anybody's on insulin we got to just check them a little bit more frequently.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H218
Okay.  Um when you do check them what do you think they run?

PATIENT H218
You was gonna say something.  Oh well anywhere from uh 140, 150, up to maybe 160, or 70.

DOCTOR H218
Okay.  Any lows, have you felt low?

PATIENT H218
Uh when I first got out of the hospital I was getting some 80s and 70s.

DOCTOR H218
Okay and you felt it then huh.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H218
Okay, okay, the 140s to 150s, low 70s, alrighty.  Okay now the last number we had on you, do you know what an A1c is?

PATIENT H218
No.

DOCTOR H218
Okay so instead of, so what an A1c is this new measure that we have for the last couple of years uh to check on patients with diabetes.  It's a test that we check in your blood and they checked it in your blood when you were in the hospital and it gives you kind of like an average reading over the three months.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H218
When you just prick your finger it's just really.

PATIENT H218
Right.

DOCTOR H218
What you just age, what time of day it is, what medicines you're on but this one gives us an average for over three months okay and for every diabetic their goal is less than 7 okay.  For you, yours was 7.3.  So close but not close yeah.

PATIENT H218
Still a little bit high.

DOCTOR H218
Yeah so um I think since they put you on that regimen of insulin we have to just wait a couple of months right, to see if it's really taking effect.  Which is fine you know.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H218
Which is okay so we'll just have you check in a couple of months and see how that's going.  Now um issue number two is you had a history of high blood pressure right.  Yes.

PATIENT H218
Well I didn't have a history but I did develop a history.

DOCTOR H218
Okay @@@. Um and right now we have you on metoprolol 75 mg a day right?

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H218
Um the lisinopril 10 mg a day okay.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H218
And you're taking all those?  You don't miss a dose?

PATIENT H218
Right.

DOCTOR H218
Okay good, you're close enough to where I wouldn't change anything about it.  You're 134, 133 so that's good enough for me.  Um do you check your blood pressure at home?  Do you have a blood pressure cuff?

PATIENT H218
I have one.  I haven't been using it cause I'm in the hospital.

DOCTOR H218
You didn't do it yourself cause we're checking it for you.

PATIENT H218
And plus every, there's a woman who comes in and she does it.

DOCTOR H218
Oh good.  What has it been running when she does it?

PATIENT H218
Uh 160, 120s, 130s.

DOCTOR H218
So that kind ranges in the low one okay, okay.  We're okay now so I don't want to do too much so that's okay and then last week we started you on a medicine for your cholesterol right?

PATIENT H218
Yeah.

DOCTOR H218
The simvastatin.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H218
Okay good so let's keep going with that.  You're not having any muscle pain.

SECOND PERSON H218
I think he needs some more of the cholesterol.

DOCTOR H218
Okay, sure. We’ll refill it all.

SECOND PERSON H218
Okay.

DOCTOR H218
And then are you taking a baby aspirin?

PATIENT H218
Yes.

SECOND PERSON H218
Yeah.

DOCTOR H218
A baby aspirin.  Okay, um so a couple people we got to get you hooked up with okay.  Um one is our cardiologist okay.

PATIENT H218

DOCTOR H218

DOCTOR H218

PATIENT H218

DOCTOR H218
Oh no, we can see if there's something else we can do.  Um and then just a second, next is your colonoscopy.  Do you remember having one of those done?

PATIENT H218
Oh I've had a lot of those done in the past.

DOCTOR H218
In the past and when was the last one do you think?

PATIENT H218
Oh it's been quite a while.

DOCTOR H218
Okay.

PATIENT H218

DOCTOR H218
Yeah.  I think we said in our last note that you had it done about eight years ago.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H218
About a year ago so about nine years ago and then we tried to bring up some records from Mercy.

PATIENT H218
Yeah now Mercy, I went by there.  Mercy said after ten years they get rid of all their records.

DOCTOR H218
Okay, well is a colonoscopy something you want, well we recommend it for anybody between the age of 50 and 75 we recommend you get a colonoscopy and if it's been that long.

PATIENT H218
Okay.

Okay that's fine um we just wanted to make sure that that was being looked at but.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR H218
But sounds like they're on top of it.  So we'll just do some fine tuning and you'll be, you know, before long you'll be getting back to the point where you're able to.

PATIENT H218

SECOND DOCTOR H218
Okay take care, alright.

PATIENT H218
Thank you for stopping in.

SECOND DOCTOR H218
Okay sure.

PATIENT H218
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
So a couple of changes we're gonna make.  So for the diabetes, uh we think that you're actually overall doing pretty good.  I think we could just fine tune it just a little bit.

PATIENT H218
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
So instead of taking the 10 units, if you want to bump it up just a little bit to the 12 okay.

PATIENT H218
12 okay.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
And we'll see how it is.  You can check your sugars.  I want you to start checking your sugars more regularly at home okay.  So if you want to check it up, you know, mostly like five times out of the week you check it before.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
In the mornings or something you know before you eat anything and then a couple of times a week check it uh about an hour or so or two hours after you eat okay.

PATIENT H218
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
So that we can see both what those are and in three months when you come back to see me, I want you to tell me how your sugars have been doing, okay.

PATIENT H218
Has done, okay.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
Now if you find that you're going to low, cut back you know, try 11 units.  If that's not helping then go back to 10 okay.

PATIENT H218
Right and it's such a small difference.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
I know.  I know.  But its, but for you it might be a bigger difference.

PATIENT H218
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
Because you're not that heavy you know.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
So that makes a little bit more of a fine tuning okay.

PATIENT H218
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
And we'll get you back in to see our eye doctor.  Let's see when the last time we had you see them last um.

PATIENT H218
I know it's been at least four months, five months.

SECOND PERSON H218
Almost a year.

PATIENT H218
No that's too long isn't it?

SECOND PERSON H218
No it's been almost a year.  It was in the summertime when you had it done.

PATIENT H218
Where at?

SECOND PERSON H218

PATIENT H218
Time really flies when you're having fun.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
Well I'm glad you think that was fun.  I don't know about that.  But yeah we'll get you back in to see them.

PATIENT H218
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
And we'll get you back to see the Eye Clinic so let's do that.  We're going to increase that to 12 okay and that's it for the diabetes okay.  So next is for your heart and your blood pressure.  So with your heart condition that we were talking about your blood pressure could be just a little bit lower and it would be better okay.

PATIENT H218
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
Not too crazy but just a little lower so we wanted to you know that lisinopril that you're on, so you're taking like half a tablet right?

SECOND PERSON H218
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
We want you to go ahead and take a full tablet of it okay.  so, it'll be one tablet.

PATIENT H218
That's one tablet, one full on that one.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
Yes a full one.

PATIENT H218
And for the other one I'm already taking 1 1/2.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
Yeah.  That one you leave just as it.

PATIENT H218
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
You leave that one just as is okay.  So we'll increase that one to 20 and then next is we want to get you in to see our cardiologist, okay.

PATIENT H218
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR H218
So let me see about that we'll put in a new.

PATIENT H218
