He was just standing. I don't know if you took a drink or were going to and all of a sudden you just went down.

DOCTOR I546

DOCTOR I546
Back in December?

PATIENT I546

DOCTOR I546
Okay.  So last night you didn't have any sense like oh my gosh I'm gonna pass out.  You didn't feel palpitations or lightheaded or anything?

PATIENT I546
No, all of a sudden I was on the floor.

DOCTOR I546
All of a sudden you're on the floor okay and did anyone see it?  You saw it?

SECOND PERSON I546

SECOND PERSON I546
It looked like; well actually he didn't know what happened.

DOCTOR I546
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON I546
And it's as if he was awake.  I mean it was very fast, probably five seconds or so.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

SECOND PERSON I546
So it wasn't like the kind fell on the kitchen floor when I said he really was unconscious.

DOCTOR I546
Uh-huh.  Alright um.
SECOND PERSON I546
His coughing, choking is getting worse.

DOCTOR I546
Were you doing anything at the time that you passed out?

PATIENT I546
I was just standing at the counter as I know.

DOCTOR I546
So you weren't like drinking or eating anything or laughing?

SECOND PERSON I546
I don't know I was at the other end.

PATIENT I546
I don't think I was drinking anything cause I don't remember.

SECOND PERSON I546
Well you had a glass in front of you but I don't know if he actually drank or not.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

PATIENT I546
I don't remember.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.  You didn't lose continence of your bowels or bladder and you didn't urinate on yourself?  You don't shake uncontrollably or anything?

SECOND PERSON I546
No.

PATIENT I546
No.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.  And how's your head feel today?

PATIENT I546
My head feels, well sore where I hit it but my neck is @@@ real sore almost to the touch.  What was the third thing?  There was a third thing we were going to tell you and I forgot.  Neck and fall.  But there's a third thing.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

PATIENT I546
And I still can't feel anything as you can tell right there.  I have no idea how I got that.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

PATIENT I546
This was bigger before, it's healed a little bit.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.  

PATIENT I546
I have no idea how that happened.

DOCTOR I546
And how far up does it go, the feel.

PATIENT I546
The feeling?

DOCTOR I546
Feel yeah, I mean can you feel anything there?

PATIENT I546
No

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

PATIENT I546
I can't think of the third thing.  Oh even the therapist recommended I, suggested a wheelchair too.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah, they were recommending a wheelchair; I saw that in their notes.  Do you have one at home?

PATIENT I546
No we're gonna, I think we're gonna get one for when I walk long distances like here.

DOCTOR I546
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I546
Or like go to a mall or whatever.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah.  Do you feel dizzy when that happens?  I mean do you.

PATIENT I546
Sometimes it takes me a while, when I stand up.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah.

PATIENT I546
It’s like I get my blood flowing down to my legs.

DOCTOR I546
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON I546
I think you should tell her about how you feel in the.

PATIENT I546
Oh yeah, there's been two times now where like I'll go over and I feel like I'm upside down.

DOCTOR I546
Upside down like?

PATIENT I546
I don't know, yeah everything seems like it's upside down.  I'll wake up and I'll feel like I'm off the bed and upside down.

DOCTOR I546
Okay, okay.

SECOND PERSON I546
It's more than two times cause he's had that before.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

PATIENT I546
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah.  And when he's in the car he feels like what things are.

PATIENT I546
Roller coaster.

SECOND PERSON I546
Like when you're going down?

PATIENT I546
Yeah I've mentioned that to her before that.

DOCTOR I546
Let's see.  

PATIENT I546
See I knew I'd make your day complicated.  But it seems like, I use a snow blower for the snow we’ve been having, as long as I got that in front of me I seem to be okay.

DOCTOR I546
When you use the snowblower?

PATIENT I546
Yeah as long as I got something in front of me to hold to.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah.

PATIENT I546
But when I go to use a cane I don't.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah, this is, I mean.

PATIENT I546
So I'm using the snowblower right outside.

DOCTOR I546
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I546
Like the other day when I rode a bike to work I had two people @@@.  There was a slight little hill and it was a little bit slippery and they offered and so I took uptown.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.  Alright why don't you come over here and.

PATIENT I546
We'll see what happens.  Let's see the last time @@@ feel like the roller coastering.

DOCTOR I546
I'm going to have you lay down okay?  @@@ like this.  Any chest pain or trouble breathing?

PATIENT I546
No.

DOCTOR I546
Okay, nausea, vomiting?

PATIENT I546
No.

DOCTOR I546
Okay, diarrhea, constipation?

PATIENT I546
Constipation means that the bowel movements seem extremely big.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.  Are you taking stool softeners right now?

PATIENT I546
No.  I can't tell, are my words slurred?

DOCTOR I546
It doesn't sound much worse than the last time that I saw you here.  Now put your left arm out for me.  

PATIENT I546
What's it at?

DOCTOR I546
That was 134/80.

PATIENT I546
Now it's come down some.

DOCTOR I546
Uh-huh.  Now I'm going to have you sit up and we'll check it again.  Do you feel dizzy when you sit up?

PATIENT I546
A little, not too bad.

DOCTOR I546
Like the room is spinning or lightheadedness?

PATIENT I546
Lightheaded.

DOCTOR I546
Take a deep breath in and out.  

PATIENT I546
Where did you go over the holidays?

DOCTOR I546
Oh I was able to go home.

PATIENT I546
Oh that's good.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah it was nice.

PATIENT I546
You were on the east coast then.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah Syracuse, New York.

PATIENT I546
Ooh you got nailed with snow.

DOCTOR I546
Not as much as uh like New York City and Boston, they are really.

PATIENT I546
Oh Boston's getting hit again.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah.

PATIENT I546
My nephew goes to school in Boston and he called yesterday or today?

SECOND PERSON I546
I think it was yesterday.

PATIENT I546
Oh it was yesterday.

DOCTOR I546
Syracuse got four feet of snow in four days.

SECOND PERSON I546
Oh my gosh.

DOCTOR I546
Right before I arrived and then just as I was leaving was when that big blizzard was coming up the east coast and Boston and New York @@@.

SECOND PERSON I546
But you got out in time.

DOCTOR I546
I missed it, I got a nice white Christmas and I missed a lot of the actual snowfall.  So just relax your arm here.  Okay I'm going to @@@ blood pressure.  Okay.

PATIENT I546
What is it now?

DOCTOR I546
That was actually, it was 128/80 so.  Pretty darn close so that's good I mean.

PATIENT I546
There are worse.

DOCTOR I546
So your blood pressure doesn't seem to be dropping.  That would really explain.  Now normally when you pass out like that is it um, is it when you've been standing up for a while?

PATIENT I546
No actually I could be sitting.  Remember when I fell in the bedroom, I was sitting and I fell off the bed.

SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah but I, that was just a fall, I don't think it was like a loss of consciousness.

PATIENT I546
We have some medication to be refilled that they won't let me refill it over the phone?

DOCTOR I546
Oh yeah we can.

PATIENT I546
Hopefully we can do it.  Oh shoot, she is going to do that, she's getting the glove.

DOCTOR I546
Oh, I'm just going to look at the back of your head here.  Do you have any pus or bleeding back here?

PATIENT I546
No, not that I know of.  @@@.  Up a little bit higher.

DOCTOR I546
A little bit higher.

PATIENT I546
Yeah right where your hand was, right in through there.

DOCTOR I546
There?

PATIENT I546
Yeah.

DOCTOR I546
I don't see any cuts or anything.  Does that hurt when I'm pushing on it?

PATIENT I546
No.  Well this time it was a solid wall.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah.

PATIENT I546
Last time it was the corner.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

PATIENT I546
I thought she was going to @@@.

DOCTOR I546
Alright.

PATIENT I546
She don't like to do that.

DOCTOR I546
The neurologist, alright you had a bunch of falls since the last time you saw the neurologist right?

SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah.

PATIENT I546
And it's getting scary.

DOCTOR I546
What are you scared of?

PATIENT I546
When I fall and I don't know why I fall.

DOCTOR I546
Cause you don't get any warning right?

PATIENT I546
Right.

DOCTOR I546
Alright cause I think, I mean from what it sounds like, we've done a lot of tests, a lot of work-up for the falls, trying to figure out what's going on and we haven't had much luck determining exactly what the cause is.  We know we're thinking that's it's probably multifactorial, that there are a few different things contributing to the falls that we need to try to minimize the risks from a bunch of different things.  Um, without being able to make these episodes go away completely, I think the safest thing would probably be to have a wheelchair and just you know if you're sitting then it's not as hard to fall and that's basically.  I know it's not an answer and it's not very satisfying but for now that'll minimize the risk of hurting yourself when you fall.  Um you know from things from my perspective as a medical doctor what we would worry about is your heart being related.  Like something like having stenosis, like a restriction in some of your heart valves which you don't have based on our last time we checked your heart, um some sort of arrhythmia where your heart is going in and out of rhythm that would cause you to blackout but as far as we know that's not the case either.  Um we would worry about your blood pressure dropping and sometimes that can be a result of just having neurological problems, your body doesn't respond the same way to changes with position and kind of a.

PATIENT I546
Well what's kind of weird and everything has been the time of the day.

DOCTOR I546
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I546
It @@@ at night or in the morning or sometimes in the after you know I never know.

DOCTOR I546
Right.  Um but based on you know what we just did checking your blood pressure in different positions, it doesn't seem like your blood pressure is dropping when you sit up or stand up. Sometimes it's related, it's called vasal vagal and it's like from standing for long periods of time um so it's kind of hard to say.  But from a lot of the things that I'm used to managing and dealing with, we've kind of ruled those things out.

PATIENT I546
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I546
Um it may be partly related to some of the medications you're given um, helping one thing can sometimes just bring other problems and it may be related to the ataxia and you know the kind of a big syndrome of stuff you have going on that we're trying to get a handle on.  I don't know, I don't have any great answers for you, I wish I did.

SECOND PERSON I546
What's really hard for him now is he's choking so violently.  He'll sit down and just take one bite.  

DOCTOR I546
He'll turn red and.

SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah and once he just gets through this thing he seems to be okay.  It's just like that first swallows are really violent.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah.  Are you, I saw that you went back and got another swallow evaluation.

SECOND PERSON I546
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I546
Are you using the chin tuck and the maneuvers?

PATIENT I546
@@@.

DOCTOR I546
@@@.

PATIENT I546
Even when I drink I try to make sure I'm over the table or something.

SECOND PERSON I546
I try to encourage him to take smaller bites and to chew it better.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON I546
@@@.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.  Yeah, I mean.

PATIENT I546
Or even when it's plain, like we had soup and that went down real easy and I was even coughing with that real bad.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah soup is actually hard because it's a mixture of consistencies.  You've got stuff that you have to chew.

SECOND PERSON I546
He has yeah, little lumps in it.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah so you've got to, your mouth has to kind of organize it and swallow things kind of one at a time; you've got the thin stuff and the big stuff.

SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah.

DOCTOR I546
So that actually can be kind of tricky.  A lot of times what they do is you know try to get people to separate their liquids and their solids.

PATIENT I546
Well I'm still going like this even when I'm drinking anything.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah.  Okay.

PATIENT I546
It's very, very frustrating.

DOCTOR I546
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I546
I get kind of upset when I start coughing so bad.

DOCTOR I546
Have you ever tried using like thickening stuff and did that help at all?

PATIENT I546
No.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

PATIENT I546
It seems the thinner it is the better it is.

DOCTOR I546
Really okay.  So you cough more when you're drinking thickened liquids.

PATIENT I546
Seems like it.

DOCTOR I546
I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT I546
Alright.

SECOND PERSON I546
You want to do these medications @@@.

PATIENT I546
When she gives that.

DOCTOR I546
Do you know which medications that need refills?

SECOND PERSON I546
Well this one's zero.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

SECOND PERSON I546
And he said um @@@.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

SECOND PERSON I546
That he called and wouldn't refill it.

DOCTOR I546
@@@.  Four refills so @@@.  And that was probably prescribed by the Neurology folks but let me, I'll go over the list with you when I get back.

SECOND PERSON I546
Okay.

PATIENT I546
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  47:15  DOCTOR IN:  56:05)

DOCTOR I546
Alrighty.  I would like because it's been a while since you had your blood work done, I'd like to do a little bit of blood work to make sure, just check a few things to make sure we're not contributing to the falls that you're having.

PATIENT I546
Okay.

DOCTOR I546
And I would also like to check an EKG today.

PATIENT I546
Can you do that up here?

DOCTOR I546
Uh we'll see if he's here.  He wasn't here this morning but we'll try.

PATIENT I546
Okay.  It don't like you.

DOCTOR I546
No @@@.  Now the third thing we'd like to do, I'm going to check like your vitamin D level which is something that's important for building you know strong bones.

PATIENT I546
It don't want you to do that.

SECOND PERSON I546
Sounds alarming.

DOCTOR I546
And um the other thing I'd like to do just because of all these falls that are happening, of course we want to avoid the falls as much as we can by um kind of like adapting to what's going on but I'd like to check a DEXA scan of your bones and make sure that you don't have osteoporosis or anything like that.  Some of these medications that you end up on for long periods of time can have a negative effect on your bones and I want to make sure that if you fall your bones are as strong as they can be to avoid a fracture.

PATIENT I546
I haven't broke anything yet.

DOCTOR I546
I know but we don't want to @@@ that can be a devastating problem.

PATIENT I546
Yeah.

DOCTOR I546
Once it happens so it's an easy test um, I'll put in the order for that and they can schedule it for you um.  You may need to call and schedule it actually but we'll see.  

SECOND PERSON I546
I should ask the dietician like stuff I should do cause I've fallen twice in the last month.

DOCTOR I546
Oh no.  Have you had a DEXA scan?

SECOND PERSON I546
Yeah.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah we commonly get them for women but we don't really think of it for men.

SECOND PERSON I546
I take Vitamin D too.

PATIENT I546
Just what I need more pills.

SECOND PERSON I546
I know.

DOCTOR I546
Vitamin D isn't that bad, if you need it you take it once a week.

SECOND PERSON I546
Those are those pretty green pills.

PATIENT I546
I thought they checked once for vitamin D.

DOCTOR I546
I can check and see when the last time was.  The last time you had labs here was a while ago.  They tried before but I guess they didn't get a good enough blood for it.

PATIENT I546
@@@.

DOCTOR I546
We'll try again.  

PATIENT I546
When do you want my medication reviewed?

DOCTOR I546
Let's see what we've got for medications.

PATIENT I546
Um I need amlodipine.

DOCTOR I546
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I546
I have nothing left on that.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

PATIENT I546
Etodolac, I only got two left on that and that really really works.

SECOND PERSON I546
@@@.

PATIENT I546
The what?

SECOND PERSON I546
@@@.  It says there are four refills.

PATIENT I546
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON I546
@@@.

DOCTOR I546
So you've got, you filled it in July, August, then did you stop taking it for a while or?

PATIENT I546
I don't have any.

DOCTOR I546
Uh when did you try to refill it?

PATIENT I546
Uh this week sometime.

DOCTOR I546
Okay what do you take that for?

PATIENT I546
I don't even know.

DOCTOR I546
It's like an allergy medication.  Were you?

PATIENT I546
Okay, probably for my nose.

DOCTOR I546
Allergy problems?

PATIENT I546
Well, it seems I do but I don't know what I'm allergic to.  I'm allergic to coffee and uh or caffeine and penicillin, that's all I know of.

DOCTOR I546
But like seasonal allergies, stuffy nose, postnasal drip, stuff like that?

PATIENT I546
Stuffy nose all the time.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah okay.

PATIENT I546
Then I got one more.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.

PATIENT I546
@@@.  I think that's it.

DOCTOR I546
Alright, oh sorry did you need those to pick those up in the Pharmacy or did you want them mailed?

PATIENT I546
No I'll just get them mailed if they can.

DOCTOR I546
Okay.  Okay, alright.

PATIENT I546
It's easier that way.

DOCTOR I546
So I'd like you to get that EKG done, we'll see if they can do it for you up here.

PATIENT I546
Okay.

DOCTOR I546
But if not you may need to go down to the um Cardiology Lab down on the first floor.  So let me see if he's here, if not I'll give you directions.

PATIENT I546
Okay.

DOCTOR I546
Alright he's not here so we'll have you go downstairs.  Um so you'll go down, you know where the Lab is downstairs right?

PATIENT I546
Yeah.

DOCTOR I546
Okay so we'll have you go there to get the blood tests done and then I'd like you to go to the, you can kind of, I think there are signs up that say like EKG testing.  It'll be on the first floor and you'll head towards four corners.

PATIENT I546
Okay.

DOCTOR I546
But uh before you get to four corners you'll turn left down what seems like kind of an empty hallway alright.

PATIENT I546
I've been there before.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah, it's between the elevators and @@@.

PATIENT I546
It's down to the basement floor.

DOCTOR I546
Oh did they send you down there?

PATIENT I546
Yeah.

DOCTOR I546
For the EKG?

PATIENT I546
Yeah.

DOCTOR I546
Oh okay.  I've been told to send people it's on the first floor.

PATIENT I546
I'm going there, its close.

DOCTOR I546
You can ask yeah, ask around maybe they'll tell you I'm wrong but that's where I've been told to send people before.

PATIENT I546
So all the previous @@@ Building 228.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah so, yeah see what you can find out.  If they send you to the basement I apologize.  Alright and I'll let you know what I find out from the tests and what the results are of the DEXA scan.

PATIENT I546
Okay and we're all set then right?

DOCTOR I546
Yep.  

SECOND PERSON I546
And have they called them about the prescriptions.

DOCTOR I546
Uh yeah I mean I put the order in the computer so you can ask them up front if they can schedule for you, if not then @@@.

PATIENT I546
We just usually call.  We need to check the calendar at home.

DOCTOR I546
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON I546
We always do.

PATIENT I546
@@@.

DOCTOR I546
Take care, be safe okay.

PATIENT I546
Yeah, do we give this to the guy up there?

DOCTOR I546
Yeah.  We'll see you, take care.

PATIENT I546
We'll see what happens.

DOCTOR I546
Alright.

PATIENT I546

DOCTOR I546
