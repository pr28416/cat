DOCTOR F934
PATIENT?  Have a seat.

PATIENT F934
Okay.

DOCTOR F934
How you doing?

PATIENT F934
@@@.

DOCTOR F934
So um, any problems today?

PATIENT F934
Yeah.  Uh the one thing I was running late and ran out of the house, I forgot my, what's that thing, that meter, glucose meter.

DOCTOR F934
Okay.  So you don't have your log with you?

PATIENT F934
Hmm?

DOCTOR F934
Did you bring a log of your blood sugars?

PATIENT F934
No I didn't bring the log cause I tell you I had stopped.  There's a lot of things that's happened since the last time,  there’s a death in the family, uh, a close relative died and that threw me off.  I was taking those shots and everything but as far as taking – I was kinda bad with that until uh then I had another personal problem.

DOCTOR F934
@@@ personal problems?

PATIENT F934
Uh so but I can say, I can tell you what the uh, what the numbers are.

DOCTOR F934
Okay.

PATIENT F934
They been running in the high twos and low threes.

DOCTOR F934
Okay.

PATIENT F934
Now go ahead, I'll ask you these questions at the end.

DOCTOR F934
No you ask me your questions first.

PATIENT F934
Um it's about the medication.  Now I been on this medication for a while, and it doesn't seem to be bringing the numbers down.

DOCTOR F934
The insulin?

PATIENT F934
Yeah.

DOCTOR F934
You're not on a very high dose and you're not going up on it that fast because you, the last time you were here we were you told me your numbers were in the low 100s okay and that would be good but your A1c, your three months blood sugars is not showing that and so that's why I sent you over to the diabetes pharmacist so that you could go up on the insulin to get your sugars controlled okay.

PATIENT F934
What?

DOCTOR F934
Um I saw that you missed a couple of appointments with them uh.

PATIENT F934
Well.

DOCTOR F934
They wanted to see you at the end of December.

PATIENT F934
Right.

DOCTOR F934
It sounds like you had some personal.

PATIENT F934
Yeah but that's not, that day something, either the weather and I called and with the system asking me do you want to cancel or do you want to reschedule and I told it I want to reschedule.  They said we'll be sending you out this information.

DOCTOR F934
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F934
They never sent it out.  The only way I got it is that I redid it myself.  Your appointment and their appointment so I don't know why.

DOCTOR F934
When do you go see them next?

PATIENT F934
Today.

DOCTOR F934
Today at what time?

PATIENT F934
After you.

DOCTOR F934
Okay.

PATIENT F934
They said I had two appointments.

DOCTOR F934
Okay.  Yeah.  And you were running a little bit late, so you'll have a hard time getting to the other one on time.  Um.

PATIENT F934
Well.

DOCTOR F934
You know, we need to.  How much insulin are you taking right now?

PATIENT F934
30.

DOCTOR F934
30 okay.  They had asked you to go up on it by um 2 units every four days if your sugars were still high.  Have you been doing that?

PATIENT F934
Well nobody told me that.

DOCTOR F934
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F934
2 units every four days.

DOCTOR F934
Yeah until your sugars come down to the 100s in the morning.  But that, you know that takes a lot of checking on your part so if you don't, if you have other things going on and you're not checking your sugars, you know you definitely have a lot work to do on your diabetes.  Okay.  And I understand that sometimes personal problems, you know things going on in your personal life get in the way of that but you know we definitely have a lot of work to do.  Um going up on the insulin, I mean we may have you come up to giving insulin twice a day or adding um an insulin that you take with meals but.

PATIENT F934
With what?

DOCTOR F934
With meals.

PATIENT F934
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR F934
Another shot with each meal that you eat.  Um but that takes a lot of work on your part as well.  I mean you are writing everything down and putting it in a log so you know what to do um.

PATIENT F934
Right.  @@@.

DOCTOR F934
Um I'm gonna let the diabetes pharmacist change your insulin okay.  

PATIENT F934
Change it to the 2.

DOCTOR F934
Well uh yeah.  I'll let them talk to you about what to, this is all she does all day long um and so you know you should be going to see her every month until we get this under better control okay.

PATIENT F934
Okay.

DOCTOR F934
Um so I'm not going to change anything but I can tell you, when you see her I'll let her do that when you see her after we're done okay.

PATIENT F934
Alright.

DOCTOR F934
Um.

PATIENT F934
Now okay go ahead you go first.

DOCTOR F934

DOCTOR F934
Do you want 90 days of the hydralazine?

PATIENT F934

Alright.  Um let's see what else, any problems with shortness of breath?  Okay.  No chest pain or anything like that?

PATIENT F934
Nope.  In fact, well I shouldn't say this but I think it must not be right.  I used to have problems with my legs as far as them swelling.

DOCTOR F934
Is that better?

PATIENT F934
It hasn't done that in a long time.

DOCTOR F934
Well that's good.

PATIENT F934
And @@@.

DOCTOR F934
So that means the medicines are doing their jobs.

PATIENT F934
Huh?

DOCTOR F934
The medicines are doing their jobs.

PATIENT F934
Yeah because, like it would be like right here.

DOCTOR F934
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F934
It would be out here.

DOCTOR F934
Yeah.

PATIENT F934
You know what I mean and then there's nothing in the ankles.

DOCTOR F934
Yeah.  Um let's see last time in December we checked your cholesterol.  Your cholesterol is not quite where we need it to be.

PATIENT F934
It was under 200 the last time I took it, what is it?

DOCTOR F934
So your total cholesterol was 300 in December okay.  The bad cholesterol is 119 and when you have diabetes we want it under 70 okay.  Um and given your history of heart problems in the past okay.  So you're on, let's see, you're on the um simvastatin 80 mg.

PATIENT F934
I take them once every night.

DOCTOR F934
Let's see.

PATIENT F934
There's three pills I take at night, that one, the prostate medicine and the uh orange pill.

DOCTOR F934
Let's see.  Well I'll have to see what, you're on the highest dosage that we have here so I'll have to talk to DOCTOR about you know if we can get you a different medicine uh or what we can do.  Uh but you're cholesterol needs to come down as well, okay.

PATIENT F934
I brought it down cause the last time I.

DOCTOR F934
It was down back a year ago but when we tested it in December it was back up.

PATIENT F934
Well I'm taking @@@.

DOCTOR F934
And we checked it today and it's not back yet.  The thing is if that comes back, the blood that you had done this morning, it looks like your kidney function is not doing the best.  Have you ever seen the kidney doctors?

PATIENT F934
No.

DOCTOR F934
Okay.  Um you're seeing the urologist right for your um, for your cancer of the prostate right?

PATIENT F934
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F934
No problems there?

PATIENT F934
Uh uh.  I got an appointment with him in a couple of weeks.

DOCTOR F934
Okay it's likely the worsened kidney function is from your diabetes okay and the high blood pressure.  Your blood pressure has been uncontrolled you know in the past you probably you've had it @@@ but right now it's okay.  Um so it's just another reason to get the diabetes under control okay.  Um and yeah.

PATIENT F934
They gonna do a PSA on that?

DOCTOR F934
PSA did they check that today as well?  Um, the last time we checked it was in September and it was low, it was 0.03 so very low, that's good, no problems there.  Um so you know really getting the diabetes under control, all I'm gonna do for you today is to increase the blood pressure medicine and see if we can change the cholesterol medicine.

PATIENT F934
Okay.

DOCTOR F934
And anything else you want to talk to me about?

PATIENT F934
Uh uh.

DOCTOR F934
Okay.  Come have a seat up here.  And you said no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no belly problems, problems urinating?

PATIENT F934
Just that, uh.

DOCTOR F934
You’re going more often?

PATIENT F934
No more than before.

DOCTOR F934
That's partly because of your sugars.  Your sugar @@@ affects your urine and when we checked in December it was high.

PATIENT F934
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F934
It happens when the blood sugar is high.  You know, when you have @@@ comes out in your urine, you can urinate more.  Hopefully we can get your sugars down and we can make that better too.

PATIENT F934
I hope so.

DOCTOR F934
Deep breath, again.  @@@ during the day?  No?

PATIENT F934
Uh uh.

DOCTOR F934

PATIENT F934
