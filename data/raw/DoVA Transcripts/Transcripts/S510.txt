DOCTOR S510

PATIENT S510
The first thing that happened that nobody caught on to it, when I went swimming I would get a severe pain along side my toenail but there was no sliver there.

DOCTOR S510
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S510
Then a little later on then she got the diagnosis test came through on the diabetic thing.

Okay.  Okay any trouble with your hearing?

PATIENT S510
Yeah frequency.

DOCTOR S510
How long have you known that?  Were you diagnosed?

PATIENT S510
Yeah uh, well actually I get the final number to it but they think it was coming on for a long time cause I was a security police for the Air Force.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.

PATIENT S510
The jet engine noise and then I was on the police department and sheriff's department here in Maywood.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.

PATIENT S510
So we're shooting gun range noise and then one day my tractor tire froze to the axel and I used a metal thing to try to hammer it out.

DOCTOR S510
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S510
And I was under a deck.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.

PATIENT S510
And it created a lot of echoing and when I went in the house I was on the far side of the living room, the TV was on and I realized I could not understand the people talking on the TV.

DOCTOR S510
Yeah.  So have you needed hearing aids?

PATIENT S510
And it didn't get better later.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.  When did you see Audiology last?

PATIENT S510
About a year and a half ago.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.

PATIENT S510
I had an hearing test done and they said it was the frequency.  I can hear deep frequency.

DOCTOR S510
@@@ okay.

PATIENT S510
But all the words are kind of different.  When high frequency enters the word sometimes then I miss it.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.  How long have you had hearing loss?

PATIENT S510
Oh I probably had it without realizing for a while.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.

PATIENT S510
But the actual, when I really did all that hammering.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.

PATIENT S510
You know it was like probably the last straw for the eardrums.

DOCTOR S510
I'm going to get you to the Lab today.

PATIENT S510
Okay.

DOCTOR S510
Okay and we'll get electrolytes.  Just a standard blood count just so that we have it on file and then your diabetic test, your hemoglobin A1c and then I'll check your liver.  The cholesterol, did you eat lunch today?

PATIENT S510
Huh?

DOCTOR S510
Did you eat lunch?

PATIENT S510
No.

DOCTOR S510
No, okay you didn't. 

PATIENT S510
No because I expected you might be sending to the Lab.

DOCTOR S510
Right.  Did you eat breakfast?

PATIENT S510
No.

DOCTOR S510
Good, okay let's do your cholesterol.

PATIENT S510
I had coffee this morning.

DOCTOR S510
That's okay.

PATIENT S510
Alright.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.  So we'll get your cholesterol.  I'll get your prostrate lab and some urine tests.  Okay.  And send you to Audiology for your hearing.  Have they talked with you about hearing aids before?

PATIENT S510
Pardon?

DOCTOR S510
Have they ever talked to you about hearing aids before?

PATIENT S510
Oh when I had that first hearing test.

DOCTOR S510
Okay but then you said, it got better so they didn't want to do that and then I'll put in a referral for your um because you're due for a colonoscopy and actually a lot of these tests are the same @@@.  But I'll check that one and this is for a colonoscopy.  This is a screening for colorectal cancer.  You have a prosthetic heart valve?

PATIENT S510
Pardon?

DOCTOR S510
Any trouble with your heart valve?

PATIENT S510
No.

DOCTOR S510
No pacemaker or defibrillator?  You don't use oxygen?

PATIENT S510
No.

DOCTOR S510
No recent stroke or heart attack?

PATIENT S510
Nope.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.  No stents in your heart?

PATIENT S510
Nope.

DOCTOR S510
And you're not on Plavix, Coumadin, Aggrenox.  You are on aspirin every day?  Are you on an aspirin every day?

PATIENT S510
Yes.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.  Um and you're okay with having a colonoscopy?

PATIENT S510
Yeah.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.  Have you ever been screened for an aneurysm in your aorta?

PATIENT S510
I don't know.

DOCTOR S510
Okay you smoked for a while and you have diabetes, high cholesterol, um your blood pressure looks okay but all of that together puts at higher risk for having an aneurysm of your aorta.  And an aneurysm is like, you know how you see bubble gum and you blow a bubble and if you blew a bubble, the bubble is a thin layer of gum compared to the rest of the gum that you're chewing in your mouth so the wall of your aorta pouches out like that and is very thin and it could rupture.  And so if it ruptures um, so what we do is we screen for it and if we see that you have one and it's a certain size, very little, we just watch it but if we see that it grows fast or that it's big then we refer you to a vascular surgeon so that they can fix it.

PATIENT S510
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S510
So would you be interested in being screened for that knowing that if it's large then you'd have to go to surgery for it.  When they rupture 50% are fatal so that's why we screen for them, in males who have high risks and who smoked.  Would you like to elect for it, it's an ultrasound, it's an ultrasound.  Okay.  Okay, so we'll do that screening test too.  Alright.  Let me just um, standing you up here and I'll look at your feet.

PATIENT S510
Okay.

DOCTOR S510
You need an eye exam.  So I'll have you sit there and you can start with removing your socks and shoes.  Since you have smoked for 50 years, it's good to make sure that you don't have that.  Okay you can sit back.  

PATIENT S510
Oh I did have one kind of surgery I forgot to mention.  What do they call it, um?

DOCTOR S510
A laminectomy?

PATIENT S510
When the thing bubbles out and pushes against the nerve bundle?

DOCTOR S510
Oh stenosis, spinal stenosis.

PATIENT S510
Yeah, the soft tissue in the spine?  Uh it herniated out.

DOCTOR S510
Oh a herniated disk.

PATIENT S510
Yes.  They did a laser discectomy on it.

DOCTOR S510
Oh when was that?

PATIENT S510
It was uh, it was maybe a year to a year and a half ago.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.  Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath, deep breath, deep breath okay.  You can breathe normally.  Hold your breath okay and breathe.  Okay and hold your breath again.  Okay.  Any belly pain?  Any chest pain?

PATIENT S510

DOCTOR S510

PATIENT S510
No, uh uh.

DOCTOR S510
Okay, alright.  Did you have Viagra before?

PATIENT S510
No.

DOCTOR S510
No, you've never tried it before okay?  So why do you think you need it now?

PATIENT S510
It ain't working.

DOCTOR S510
Okay.

PATIENT S510
Also because I heard on the net that it opens up blood cells and it might be a feet warner too.

DOCTOR S510
Okay what are you using for?

PATIENT S510
Pardon?

DOCTOR S510
You're using it for sexual activity right?  Viagra.

PATIENT S510
I would need it for that but.

DOCTOR S510
Okay, okay.

PATIENT S510
But it might open up blood cells around the feet a little bit so my feet feel a little warmer too.

DOCTOR S510
Hmm, well you wouldn't take it that often to do that.

PATIENT S510
Huh?

DOCTOR S510
You wouldn't take it that often to see it affect long term like that.

PATIENT S510
Yeah.  Okay.

DOCTOR S510
If you were just taking it intermittently.

PATIENT S510
Yeah.

DOCTOR S510
