DOCTOR F064
Okay.

PATIENT F064
And he said that uh probably was the cholesterol medication I was taking.

DOCTOR F064
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F064
He told me to stop taking it.  

DOCTOR F064
Has that stuff gone away sometime?

PATIENT F064
It did slow down a lot. Every now and then I get it, I mean I get it just not as much as I was getting it before so I thought I was having a heart attack man.

DOCTOR F064
Mainly in the shoulder this time?

PATIENT F064
My shoulder, right shoulder and in the left arm and the right arm, achy all over.  Even in my head with that stuff.

DOCTOR F064

DOCTOR F064
Are the symptoms completely gone now?

PATIENT F064
Well it comes and goes.  Every now and then it'll come and I get the pain in my shoulders and my arms, you know not as much as it was before.  Doctor said it would take a while before it was out of my system.

DOCTOR F064
That's true.  Um when do you get that pain in your shoulder?

PATIENT F064
Especially at night when I'm laying down.

DOCTOR F064
Do you ever get it when you're walking around?

PATIENT F064
Sometimes.  Very rarely, not too regular.

DOCTOR F064
Okay.

PATIENT F064
But when I lay down and relax that's when the pain in the shoulders, arms, I get the pain.

DOCTOR F064
Um, do you ever get short of breath with that?

PATIENT F064
Sometimes I get a little bit short of breath just when I walk.

DOCTOR F064
Do you get the shortness of breath at the same time as the shoulder pain or is that separate?

PATIENT F064
It's separate.

DOCTOR F064
Okay.  Uh what about nausea or vomiting?

PATIENT F064
No sir.

DOCTOR F064

DOCTOR F064
You had a and in the past you've had some testing done on your heart.

PATIENT F064
I had stents.

DOCTOR F064
Yeah but even since that time um, it looks like you've had a stress test.

PATIENT F064
A long time before I had the stents.

DOCTOR F064

PATIENT F064
Before I get stents again.

DOCTOR F064

PATIENT F064
Pardon?

DOCTOR F064
Can you walk now without getting short of breath?

PATIENT F064
Uh if I walk alone, just walk to fast I'll be short of breath.

DOCTOR F064
Okay.  How long is a long distance?

PATIENT F064
I'd say about one block.

DOCTOR F064
One block?

PATIENT F064
Yes.  I take more steps when I walk fast, try to keep up with my wife you know and then I get tired.

DOCTOR F064
I don't blame you at all okay.  Trying to find when that stress test was that you did.  November.  Alright so, it's good. That makes me feel better.

PATIENT F064
What's that?

DOCTOR F064
So the stress test that you had was good.

PATIENT F064
It was good but um, but there was this young guy up there.  He suggested that I go downstairs and take that cardiac angiogram.

DOCTOR F064
Angiogram?

PATIENT F064
Angiogram right.  He suggested I do that.  And when I was on the table and he was doing it, then the doctor came in and he told me I two blockages and said he's going to put two stents while I was in there already.

DOCTOR F064
That was done here?

PATIENT F064
Yes, right here.

DOCTOR F064
Trying to figure out when that was done, what month.  Okay February.  

PATIENT F064
Was it in 09, was it ’09?

DOCTOR F064
No it was in January 2010.

PATIENT F064
January?  No, was it?

DOCTOR F064
Yeah.

PATIENT F064
I didn't think so.

DOCTOR F064
Well let me see, yeah that's when they planned to do it at least.

PATIENT F064
Pardon?

DOCTOR F064
February, February 2010, that was about a year ago.  And you had one vessel that was blocked.

PATIENT F064
There were two blockages.

DOCTOR F064
Yeah, two main ones blocked and what did they do for you, they put some stents in at that time.

PATIENT F064
Yes they did.  Two stents.  And kept me in the hospital for a day or two.

DOCTOR F064
But does what you have now, does it feel at all the same as what you had back then?

PATIENT F064
I really think, I didn't feel no different back then cause I didn't know I had a blockage or anything you know.

DOCTOR F064
Okay.

PATIENT F064
I didn't know until they told me.  I was downstairs on the table so.  

DOCTOR F064
Hop up here.  Yeah, let me look at your medication list here.

DOCTOR F064

PATIENT F064
But @@@ stabilize it.

DOCTOR F064
Well I think we need to um, we need to get them better than that cause I think you're right.  300s, 230, 240s that's too high, we want to get it lower than that.  Now when was your last A1c, let me find out.  Okay so August.

PATIENT F064
A couple times it go low you know, I can feel it goes low you know a couple times.

DOCTOR F064
Start feeling bad?

PATIENT F064

DOCTOR F064
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F064
I feel real jittery you know.

DOCTOR F064
Yeah.  Alright so your hemoglobin A1c, that's the blood test that we use to check how your sugar has been over a three month period.

PATIENT F064
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F064
It's been right around 7, 6.9 to 7.3.  That's pretty good.  We want it to be lower than 7 if we can.  So we’ll try to, we can adjust a little bit your regimen.  Now looks like your cholesterol was also checked back at that time, about a year ago.  We need to check that again.

PATIENT F064
The last @@@.

DOCTOR F064
@@@.

PATIENT F064
That was in March, when I came downstairs I think we checked it.

DOCTOR F064
Yeah here it is.

PATIENT F064
Yeah, they should have checked it downstairs.

DOCTOR F064
No they didn't actually check that one.  They checked a lot of other good things but not that one.  I'm going to order a few things right now for you.  Um have you ever been on lisinopril?

PATIENT F064
What?

DOCTOR F064
We didn't get through the rest of your list so I need to talk to you about the rest of your medications.  You're on Losartan, metoprolol, a multivitamin.

PATIENT F064
Right.

DOCTOR F064
Omega 3 fatty acids, omeprazole, you were on simvastatin, sildenafil for erectile dysfunction and terazosin for prostate.

PATIENT F064
Yes sir.

DOCTOR F064
Eye drops, okay.

PATIENT F064
Can you take them off?

DOCTOR F064
I wish I could.  No I don't think we can today.  So your blood tests from the first of this month look pretty good.

PATIENT F064
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F064
Um your hemoglobin is just a little bit low and that's the blood count, you know the total blood count, it's still a little low.

PATIENT F064
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F064
When was your last colonoscopy?

PATIENT F064
Hmm, I don't know cause I had one here didn't I?

DOCTOR F064
Um I don't know I could check for you though.  All your other tests look pretty good so I think really it's the diabetes that we need to work on, just to continue to fine tune that.  I think you're not too far off from where you need to be overall.  Have you seen an eye doctor this year?

PATIENT F064

PATIENT F064
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F064

DOCTOR F064
Perfect and then one time throughout the day, about two hours after you eat.

PATIENT F064

DOCTOR F064

PATIENT F064
Okay.

DOCTOR F064
Cause then we can adjust your insulin if we need to.  Uh no medicine changes for now and you have an appointment next month with the cardiologist?

PATIENT F064
Yes, I think it's made for the 15th.

DOCTOR F064
Oh that's good.  I want you to mention the shoulder pain to them.  I don't think it's your heart but you didn't have chest pain before they found this blockage last time, I want to make sure it's not a new blockage.

PATIENT F064
It showed that before.

DOCTOR F064
Right.

PATIENT F064
I don't have chest pain; I don't have no chest pain now.

DOCTOR F064

DOCTOR F064
Alright, thanks for waiting.  So I think we can make one small adjustment for you.  You're taking 36 units of insulin twice a day?

PATIENT F064
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F064
I want to go up on the morning dose okay so to about 38, it's a small increase.  You'll go from 36 to 38 in the morning.

PATIENT F064
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F064
Keep it at 36 in the evening and do like I told you which is check your blood sugar in the morning and then in the evening and we'll see how they go.  Everything else is going to be the same for now and then we'll see you back in about 6-8 weeks.

PATIENT F064
Don't take the cholesterol medicines, should I stay off it?

DOCTOR F064
Oh you know what, you're right.  I wanted to talk to you about that too.  I think its okay to restart that but I want to start it at a lower dose.  You're taking the highest dose that's available right now.  I'm going to change that so that it's a low dose.

PATIENT F064

DOCTOR F064
It was 80; I'm going to go to 20.

DOCTOR F064
