DOCTOR V244
PATIENT. 

PATIENT V244
Hi.

DOCTOR V244
Good to see you.

PATIENT V244
DOCTOR how are you?

DOCTOR V244
I'm okay.  (Doctor on phone)  Hi, how are you today?

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
So let me just, see if I can find this.  @@@  So I wondered if @@@, looks good.  Well since I last saw you what's been going on?

PATIENT V244
Well you know not much.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
Except there's three things.  One is I have some postnasal drip and sore throat.

DOCTOR V244
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V244
And I just finished antibiotics, my wife's doctor I went to.

DOCTOR V244
Oh okay.

PATIENT V244
Cause it's out there but I have a history of sinus infections.

DOCTOR V244
What did you take?

PATIENT V244
Uh he gave me something called Septrabs, have you heard it?

DOCTOR V244
No actually, I'm gonna take a look at that name.

PATIENT V244
Just called her and asked her.

DOCTOR V244
That's alright.  

PATIENT V244
Some kind of antibiotic.

DOCTOR V244
Sometimes you know.

PATIENT V244
Maybe I spelled it wrong.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah.

PATIENT V244
Yeah it was a generic actually.  Big white pills.

DOCTOR V244
Hard to swallow.

PATIENT V244
Hard to swallow.

DOCTOR V244
Could you, can I see that again?

PATIENT V244
Yeah, maybe I spelled it wrong.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
Maybe there was something different on the end.  I know it's a B or maybe it's a D.

DOCTOR V244
Oh Bactrim.  That's an interesting drug for uh.  Do you have any allergies?

PATIENT V244
Yeah I've got a history of.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
Seasonal allergies.

DOCTOR V244
Okay but not to medications.  Hmm.  That does, it's just not a the first line drug I would use for sinusitis.

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
@@@.

PATIENT V244
Well I just finished it on, what was it, Sunday.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
But I've got the sore throat back again and that postnasal.

DOCTOR V244
Oh okay.

PATIENT V244
That's why it's coincidental to this visit but that's always my history.  Throat starts getting sore and I got postnasal.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah.

PATIENT V244
It's.

DOCTOR V244
And then you start getting the headache again.

PATIENT V244
Yeah and the headache.

DOCTOR V244
Any fevers or chills?

PATIENT V244
No, never had any.

DOCTOR V244
Anything productive like a green sputum or anything?

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
Yellowish, green and I was really get rid of a lot of it with blowing the nose a lot and cleaning a lot of it out.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah.

PATIENT V244
But it just kept coming you know.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
@@@.

DOCTOR V244
And no fever?

PATIENT V244
No.

DOCTOR V244
No chills, night sweats, no fevers.  Any headache now?

PATIENT V244
Just a little, it's here and it's right at the top at the crown of the head.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.  Okay and any cough?

PATIENT V244
It doesn't seem to be in the chest no.  It's just a sore throat.  A cough because of the stuff in the throat.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.  Okay and otherwise what's going on, anything else?

PATIENT V244
Well there's two other things.  One I've noticed, this elbow aches.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
Periodically and I think it's related to, I'm doing a lot of stuff on the computer.

DOCTOR V244
Could be.

PATIENT V244
And so I'm sitting right on the edge of the desk and this edge would be right on the elbow.

DOCTOR V244
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V244
And then it kind of aches when it starts almost like a numb feeling.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah.

PATIENT V244
In the thumb.

DOCTOR V244
That's where the ulnar nerve.

PATIENT V244
That I've been noticing.

DOCTOR V244
@@@.

PATIENT V244
I feel like it's a nerve.

DOCTOR V244
To your elbow right here.

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
Um arm and when you cup it like this.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
You get like shooting @@@.

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
@@@ actually kind of avoid that, maybe put some pad.

PATIENT V244
Well I did put a padding on it.

DOCTOR V244
Or something, did that seem to be helping?

PATIENT V244
Well what helps is if I keep it straighter or if I don't put pressure on it but it aches all the way down like through here.

DOCTOR V244
Even if you don't put pressure?

PATIENT V244
Well after it starts aching it aches.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
For a period of time.  Excuse me um I'm trying to avoid doing that on the computer but I'm left-handed so I.

DOCTOR V244
So it @@@ okay.

PATIENT V244
So I predominantly use that.

DOCTOR V244
It's not unusual okay.  It's fairly a simple @@@.

PATIENT V244
I think it is related to that computer thing.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah and it's definitely, it sounded like it's your ulnar nerve, the nerve that curves around the elbow and then it supplies basically this part of the hand.

PATIENT V244
Yeah cause I can.

DOCTOR V244
So let me see what's there.

PATIENT V244
That little finger every once in a while gets a little numbish.

DOCTOR V244
Okay, let me take a look here.  So what was the third thing?

PATIENT V244
Third thing was I just got, it's an injury I just got on Thursday.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
I play soccer.

DOCTOR V244
Oh okay.

PATIENT V244
And when I was in the service I had a blunt trauma injury to this leg.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
And it actually, what'd they call it, a herniated rectal @@@.

DOCTOR V244
Oh okay.

PATIENT V244
The muscle underneath was popping up.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
It was bubbling up.  Now over time and strengthening that has gone back down.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
But I didn't get hit or anything but it started right like here and now it's just.

DOCTOR V244
Acting up again?

PATIENT V244
Now its right up into this area and it's tender.

DOCTOR V244
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V244
And I don't, it's not bruised.

DOCTOR V244
And you haven't recently injured it?  When was the first injury?

PATIENT V244
Well it would have been probably 1969.

DOCTOR V244
Oh.

PATIENT V244
When I was in Vietnam.

DOCTOR V244
That's like a femoral.

PATIENT V244
Herniated @@@ femoris.  

DOCTOR V244
Rectus femoral okay.

PATIENT V244
Yeah that's in the record somewhere.

DOCTOR V244
@@@.  Now it is acting up?

PATIENT V244
Yeah and it's pretty.

DOCTOR V244
Do you think that physical therapy would help?

PATIENT V244
I don't know.  I just, I just, maybe I just need to lay off of it.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah have you been and you said this was, playing soccer just recently.

PATIENT V244
Well it just happened on Thursday.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
And towards the end of the game all of a sudden I felt the pain here, it's like right above the knee but when I got up, yesterday I was bent down on my knees on the ground and when I got up it was just shooting pain all the way through here.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
But um.

DOCTOR V244
And no specific trauma that you remember?

PATIENT V244
There was no trauma from it when uh.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.  And then do you usually play soccer?  You play soccer all the time.

PATIENT V244
I play twice a month, twice a week.  So that wasn't unusual.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah.

PATIENT V244
It wasn't like.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
But what's funny is I can almost feel, I can feel that lump.

DOCTOR V244
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V244
Coming back here where it was.

DOCTOR V244
Oh you can.

PATIENT V244
I've got shorts on if you want to.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT V244
Take a look at it.

DOCTOR V244
I will definitely, definitely.

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
Let me shut the door and I'll have you.

PATIENT V244
Well I've actually got gym shorts on.

DOCTOR V244
Oh good okay.

PATIENT V244
Cause I.

DOCTOR V244
Figured that.

PATIENT V244
Figured you might want to take a look at it cause it wasn't uh, you can see there's no bruising but when I do this and it might just be the muscle.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.  Let's see what it's doing here.  Now do that with this side, yeah.  The seem about the same.

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
The pain is just.

PATIENT V244
The pain is right in this vicinity right here.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.  What about when I push down, do you feel the pain?

PATIENT V244
No.

DOCTOR V244
Okay so it's more when you move it.

PATIENT V244
It's more when I stretch it.

DOCTOR V244
This way, or when you bend your knee.  I mean it definitely seems like a musculoskeletal thing.

PATIENT V244
Yes.

DOCTOR V244
For now I can do like ibuprofen and hot packs.

PATIENT V244
And I have been doing that.

DOCTOR V244
Has that helped?

PATIENT V244
Alternating cold and hot.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
And it does seem to help and I think I just need to probably lay off of it.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah that's what I would do.  I mean if it seems musculoskeletal, I'm hoping that'll go away soon, if it doesn't.

PATIENT V244
Initially it felt like it was in the bone.

DOCTOR V244
Oh really.

PATIENT V244
Now that sounds strange but it felt deep, the pain.

DOCTOR V244
Right.

PATIENT V244
And so I laid off for two days, Thursday was when it happened.  Thursday night I didn't play again until Sunday afternoon, then I started to play and it just goes like a real sharp, tearing pain in here.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
So it's fairly recent I've laid off of it.  I just wanted to make sure that um you know.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah.

PATIENT V244
Get your opinion on it.

DOCTOR V244
And absolutely.  And then I would definitely lay off of it, do the hot packs.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
And ice and we'll go from there.  If it doesn't get better.

PATIENT V244
Sure.  How long do you think this should take?

DOCTOR V244
Give it a few weeks.

PATIENT V244
Couple weeks at least.

DOCTOR V244
Sometimes muscle injuries are bad.

PATIENT V244
I used to have hamstrings so.

DOCTOR V244
Yes.

PATIENT V244
So toes and ankles but.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah sometimes it's just.

PATIENT V244
Something's bizarre again.  It came out of no where, it was at the end of the game.  So maybe I was tired though and I just strained something.

DOCTOR V244
@@@.

PATIENT V244
This is the only things that I can think of.

DOCTOR V244
(Someone comes to the door)  Sorry about that.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
Um so yeah and the other thing yeah so for this I'd probably just stay off of it, hot packs, cold packs, sometimes it takes 3-4 weeks for this all, so lay off of it and let's kind of see how it goes.

PATIENT V244
I can do that.

DOCTOR V244
If you persistently have pain then we can talk about imaging and that kind of thing.

PATIENT V244
Yes.

DOCTOR V244
Now your elbow, so let's see here, does this cause some of the symptoms at all?  Any numbness here at all?

PATIENT V244
I can feel it here on the little finger.

DOCTOR V244
Does it do it all the time or do you feel it when I’m.

PATIENT V244
No just uh, not when you're pushing.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
It was doing it before I came in here today.

DOCTOR V244
And anything when I do that?  Okay can you go like this?  Okay.  So actually, so it's called an ulnar nerve entrapment basically.  Like an ulnar neuropathy where when you're having, just exactly what you're saying.

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
It's getting spastic when you're leaning like this.

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
And you are irritating this nerve and then you start to get numbness.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
All along this area.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
So there's, you know there's conservative therapy.

PATIENT V244
Just stop doing that?

DOCTOR V244
Yeah basically.  Conservative management is stopping leaning on that elbow.  There's also surgical management but I don't think that at this point we need to do it.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
Sometimes people get it really severe where this muscle will be wasting away and this finger will actually physically get smaller than the other fingers.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
Um I don't think you're at that point yet but I would really just avoid.

PATIENT V244
I can do that, consciously do that.

DOCTOR V244
Cause you're at risk and I would just you know, try to just be cognizant of it um.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah.  It's probably like an ulnar nerve entrapment basically and it seems like.  I can show you this picture actually.

PATIENT V244
So the nerve runs close to that bone and I'm putting pressure on it.

DOCTOR V244
Exactly.  So let me just, oh that's not what I want.  I wanted to show you the elbow; oh this is not what I want.  It's actually this nerve but it goes around your elbow.

PATIENT V244
Well somewhat, I'm guessing it's somewhat similar to the sciatica if you.

DOCTOR V244
Very similar.

PATIENT V244
I've had that.

DOCTOR V244
Right very similar.

PATIENT V244
I've pulled that before.

DOCTOR V244
Here we go, this is the ulnar nerve root.  If you look.

PATIENT V244
Nerve root.

DOCTOR V244
I just lays behind your elbow going right there and then like you can imagine.

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
If you're kind of leaning on it you're gonna impinge it right here and then everything down here, it supplies mainly it supplies your pinky and then your ring finger.

PATIENT V244
Yeah and that's where I feel it.

DOCTOR V244
You're having numbness there.

PATIENT V244
And outside of the palm.

DOCTOR V244
But that's kind of what we're seeing right now.

PATIENT V244
So stay away from that pressure okay.

DOCTOR V244
And then can I have you have a seat up here sir and we'll check everything to make sure.

PATIENT V244
Yeah my throat is really my biggest.

DOCTOR V244
Have a seat right there.  Okay can you open your mouth and say ah?

PATIENT V244
Ah.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.  And do it one more time.

PATIENT V244
Ah.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.  So I didn't see exudate or anything like that.

PATIENT V244
A who?

DOCTOR V244
No exudates, no um like mucous or anything there.

PATIENT V244
Oh you don't see anything.

DOCTOR V244
Any ear pain at all?

PATIENT V244
Uh uh.  Just wax.

DOCTOR V244
Hmm.  Now this side, looks good.

PATIENT V244
It's predominately my right side.

DOCTOR V244
Where you're feeling it?

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh, that's where.

DOCTOR V244
This @@@.

PATIENT V244
Things just start yeah.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah.  Right now it actually seems like more of a viral syndrome.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
And you've had the Bactrim so I actually wouldn't add on any antibiotic unless you really are having a lot more symptoms and I might add something like Augmentin or something like that but @@@, that would probably just.  I think it really seems more viral at this point.

PATIENT V244
Yeah it was twice a day, 10 days.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
So.

DOCTOR V244
So yeah, I had, like whatever it was it should treat it.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
And we'll go from there.

PATIENT V244
What about the throat, just some lozenges?

DOCTOR V244
Yeah lozenges, that kind of thing and it's just kind of a symptomatic kind of thing.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
Sorry about that someone paging.  Deep breath please.  And the only other thing, I want to recheck your blood pressure.  It was 138/80 before which is a little high.

PATIENT V244
That's higher than normal yeah.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah so let's take it uh, sometimes you know when people are in here and it's like cuff sizes we use are different. 

PATIENT V244
A couple of times in the last three weeks, four weeks maybe.

DOCTOR V244
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V244
When I stand up, I get a little, little dizzy.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
Which might just.

DOCTOR V244
Really okay.

PATIENT V244
I've had that before.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
But um.

DOCTOR V244
You could maybe dehydrated?

PATIENT V244
Yeah it's a possibility; I don't drink probably enough water.  

DOCTOR V244
You're pretty active.  You've just got to remember to kind of keep hydrated.

PATIENT V244
Yeah, especially outside because.

DOCTOR V244
Now especially with the weather getting warmer.

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
And how's the ankle?  I know last time that was bugging you.

PATIENT V244
No I just, ice it when I need it.

DOCTOR V244
Do you exercise it?

PATIENT V244
I sit when I need to.  It’s getting much better.  

DOCTOR V244
Well 140/80.  It's still a little high actually.  I'm getting high too.

PATIENT V244
Well what size of this do you have?

DOCTOR V244
Well you know one of the.

PATIENT V244
I've heard that before but it's usually in the 130s.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
133, 134.

DOCTOR V244
Let me see what it was the last time you were here.  Yeah I mean it was like 132/74 last time you were here too, but I wasn't inclined to start any medications.  Let's see so, you really aren't on any medicines.

PATIENT V244
Uh uh.  The only thing I'm taking is Allerest.  I was doing that statin, what was it?

DOCTOR V244
Oh yeah are you still taking that?

PATIENT V244
Oh yeah, until I run out.  

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
I've got about another five weeks worth.

DOCTOR V244
Here you are, so I'm just looking at your labs from today.  No diabetes.

PATIENT V244
Well that's good news.

DOCTOR V244
You're white count is good.  You know that lump on your chest as well, is that?

PATIENT V244
Oh I had, I went and had the mammogram.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah I remember.

PATIENT V244
And they called me back and think its fatty tissue.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah, so there's really nothing to do about that.

PATIENT V244
Nope, nope.  That one's fine.

DOCTOR V244
You just kind of monitor it.  Sometimes.

PATIENT V244
I found out incidentally my uncle has had several.

DOCTOR V244
Oh those fatty cysts?

PATIENT V244
Fatty things and they always thought it was some sort of tumor but it wasn't.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah.

PATIENT V244
Yeah on his stomach and his back.

DOCTOR V244
You know it's really harmless unless it's bugging you and you know a some people do get it surgically removed.

PATIENT V244
No it's not a problem.

DOCTOR V244
Um but you know, it's one of those things if it bugs you and that kind of thing.  Well okay, good so your labs actually look pretty good.  Your lipids look good.  I don't even think we need to start you on anything.

PATIENT V244
And this, I've been doing fairly well.  I exercise is there anything diet-wise or anything that can change it?

DOCTOR V244
Yeah I mean the one thing that I would say, as far as your blood pressure.

PATIENT V244
I don't eat any red meat.

DOCTOR V244
That's good.  Um what about like increasing vegetable intake and what's your alcohol use like?

PATIENT V244
Oh I have a glass of wine at dinner.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
Red wine.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
Somebody said that's supposed to be good for you.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah I think that’s fine.  Um.

PATIENT V244
On occasion I'll have a couple of beers but.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah I mean, nothing concerning.  You seem like a pretty healthy guy.  You're active.

PATIENT V244
Yeah.

DOCTOR V244
You know and sometimes you know lifestyle changes don't do enough.  I mean let's see; now you play soccer a couple times a week.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
What else um.

PATIENT V244
That's probably about the extent of the physical stuff cause I'm retired now so.

DOCTOR V244
Good.

PATIENT V244
Now in with summer coming I will be outside more.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
And.

DOCTOR V244
And it might just help and I would say, I'm gonna wait.  I'm gonna have you come back and we'll check your blood pressure again.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
I mean if @@@ I want get this down @@@ to kind of more activities.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
@@@ you know play soccer maybe you can do another activity like the other days maybe walk on the treadmill or take a walk outside.

PATIENT V244
My wife wants to start walking now that the weather's nice.

DOCTOR V244
Yes.

PATIENT V244
So we're going out a couple of miles treks.

DOCTOR V244
Good.

PATIENT V244
Every day so that should help.

DOCTOR V244
Good.  And then we'll recheck your blood pressure and we'll kind of see where you can go from there.

PATIENT V244
Do I have to come down here to get this blood pressure checked?

DOCTOR V244
You know we can actually set you up and they can check it manually.

PATIENT V244
Okay cause it's like an hour and a half drive.

DOCTOR V244
I know, I know.  So you can even call in uh with your blood pressure readings in a couple weeks and just let me know what they've been.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
And that kind of let's me see this.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
And then we can go from there.  So I'll order you a blood pressure cuff and I think you can pick it up today while you're here uh let's see here.

PATIENT V244
Now this blood pressure cuff is different than what you're doing?

DOCTOR V244
Oh no, it's the same except it'll be.

PATIENT V244
Does it itself.

DOCTOR V244
Be a manual reading.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah you don't have to read it.  You don't need a stethoscope.  It's kind of like the ones at the supermarket.

PATIENT V244
Oh yeah, I’ve done those machines.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah it's very similar to that.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
It'll give you a visual reading.  It'll give you your heart rate as well.  

PATIENT V244
Are those pretty accurate?

DOCTOR V244
Uh yeah they should be.  Sometimes they @@@.

PATIENT V244
Thinking of the one I go with is a jewel.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah.  As long as you're doing it right and you're not moving and you stay still.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
And you're sitting down and your arm is like kind of like a table like this.

PATIENT V244
Yeah sitting on something.

DOCTOR V244
Bent like this and you have the cuff it should be pretty accurate.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
Whenever you move around and stuff it's not gonna work but if it's in the correct spot above your elbow.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
Make sure you're rolling up your sleeves, no clothes under it then it should be working just fine.

PATIENT V244
Well that might be the problem in the store because.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah if you always have your long sleeves on it's kind of.

PATIENT V244
Sweatshirt and something like that.

DOCTOR V244
It's not as accurate as it can be.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
So okay um otherwise.  So what I will do now is I look on your labs um and you're on a daily aspirin sir?

PATIENT V244
Yes low dose.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.  And then let's see so you got your tetanus shot and then did you get your flu shot this year?  We didn't even have them available.

PATIENT V244
No I didn't.

DOCTOR V244
Okay.

PATIENT V244
I've never had the flu shot.

DOCTOR V244
Oh okay.  So I will go talk with my attending and I'll be right back.  Otherwise, and then really today we'll just probably have you get the blood pressure cuff but everything else.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
I think you're doing good.

PATIENT V244
We're good and then the question now, when I go back, lay off a couple of weeks on the leg.

DOCTOR V244
Yes I would.

PATIENT V244
Okay, uh any idea when I go back if it hurts I just.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah I mean if it's still hurting when you stop and I mean if it's really getting severe we need to get like a MRI or some kind of imaging and see what's going on.

PATIENT V244
But a couple of weeks should give it.

DOCTOR V244
Sure a couple of weeks should give it.

PATIENT V244
Now if we're out walking during the day.

DOCTOR V244
Yes.

PATIENT V244
Like I say with my wife that shouldn't.

DOCTOR V244
That shouldn't affect it.

PATIENT V244
I don't need to wrap it or anything?

DOCTOR V244
I don't think so.  I mean it may help.  If you wanted to go to Walgreens and get one of those wraps I mean.

PATIENT V244
I've got plenty of those yeah.

DOCTOR V244
Maybe at some point.  I mean if it helps, if you feel like it helps use it.

PATIENT V244
Oh I'll try that.

DOCTOR V244
But no because it's more muscle pain, it doesn't seem like it’s a joint I don't know if it'll be that helpful.

PATIENT V244
Yeah I think it's all in the soft tissue up here.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah exactly.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
Alright, well I will be right back.

PATIENT V244
Super, thanks.

DOCTOR V244
No problem.

(DOCTOR OUT: 71:07  DOCTOR IN:  84:44)

DOCTOR V244
Alright sir, you're all set but I should be able to tell you where to go.  I think it's on the third floor where you can pick up a blood pressure cuff um but I'll have you follow-up in six months.

PATIENT V244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V244
If you can call in two weeks and just let us know what your blood pressure is.

PATIENT V244
I can give you a call.

DOCTOR V244
That would work.  Um they'll give you the number outside.

PATIENT V244
Oh okay.  That's probably where I came in.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah where you check out.

PATIENT V244
Oh I have to check out?

DOCTOR V244
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V244
I didn't know that.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah so you check out uh right around here.  Just so they know when to schedule you.

PATIENT V244
Okay.

DOCTOR V244
And everything.

PATIENT V244
And I have to tell you I'm really impressed that you remembered my ankle.

DOCTOR V244
Oh yeah.

PATIENT V244
That's pretty good detail.  I totally forgot about it.  Oh this is what I give to them.

DOCTOR V244
Yeah this is for you and I just need you to go around this corner.

PATIENT V244
Thanks a lot.

DOCTOR V244
Oh no problem.

PATIENT V244
Bye now.
