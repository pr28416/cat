PATIENT P884
Quite often.

DOCTOR P884
What’s “quite often?”

PATIENT P884
It’s like all day long, non-stop.  It's like.

DOCTOR P884
How many episodes a day?

PATIENT P884
Something like, usually one before I go to work, probably once or twice, get to work, I have to use it twice, when I get home usually and when I go to bed I have to use it.  The other morning like 3 or 4 I have to go to the bathroom.
 
DOCTOR P884

DOCTOR P884
Is it watery?

PATIENT P884
Yeah.  It's watery and uh real hard.

DOCTOR P884
Okay.

PATIENT P884
Like I'm never, I never feel the relief like I can't just go once and I'm done.  It's like more in there.  I expect, they had checked my colon.

DOCTOR P884
Yeah it was all normal.

PATIENT P884
Well I think it's in my intestines.

DOCTOR P884
Well it's the same thing, colon is the intestines.  They look at your entire intestines with a colonoscopy.

PATIENT P884
They got these, so I think I got @@@ that's all or a tapeworm or something. Something ain't right.

DOCTOR P884
Are you losing any weight or gaining weight?

PATIENT P884
No.  Still the same size.

DOCTOR P884
Okay.  Any nausea or vomiting?

PATIENT P884
Well when I use it there is so much that come out at once.

DOCTOR P884
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P884
It's a lot.

DOCTOR P884
I know it's hard, absolutely.  Do you feel anxious at all?  Do you feel like you're stressed out or anything like that or?  No, okay.  Your blood pressure looks good today.  You're taking your two medicines correct.

PATIENT P884
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P884
Perfect and at home it's been looking okay?

PATIENT P884
I really haven't been checking.

DOCTOR P884
That's okay it looks good today, that's fine and are you taking the psyllium powder?

PATIENT P884
Yeah, not that often but I take it.

DOCTOR P884
Try to take it as often as you can, daily or something like that.  I don't know if it'll help but.

PATIENT P884
No it ain't no help.

DOCTOR P884
Try that.

PATIENT P884
I had surgery on my groin.

DOCTOR P884
Yeah, you have a…

PATIENT P884
Yeah I have another one, it's like not in the groin area.  It's like up under my scrotum.

DOCTOR P884
Oh yeah, when did you first notice that?

PATIENT P884
About a month ago.

DOCTOR P884
Okay and has it gotten bigger?

PATIENT P884
It was, it went down now but.

DOCTOR P884
It's okay.

PATIENT P884
It keeps coming and going though.  

DOCTOR P884
Um do you want to go see surgery again?  Do you want to get it drained or just going down, what do you want to do?

PATIENT P884
Uh I could get it looked at, see if they could drain.

DOCTOR P884
Okay.  What did they do for it or does it just go down?  Did you do anything?

PATIENT P884
Keeping it clean.

DOCTOR P884
Okay.  Any burning when you urinate? Any penile discharge?

PATIENT P884
No.  It gets really hard, like a knot.

DOCTOR P884
Yeah and does it ever have any pus come out of it or anything like that?

PATIENT P884
No.  Well I mean, do you know where that come from?  Why I keep getting them?

DOCTOR P884
Well some people just have a certain bacteria and they are prone to get what's called furuncle they're little abscesses and they tend to be in areas that are more moist, so the groin area.

PATIENT P884
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P884
@@@ sometimes in the armpits and they tend to do that.  So you know keeping it clean and that'll go a long way and help out and know some people are prone to get it because they have what's called @@@ a certain bacteria in their body; from one source or another, who knows and then for some reason some people are more prone to develop these little abscesses, they just have to keep getting drained.

PATIENT P884
Okay.

DOCTOR P884
It's annoying.  When was the last time that you saw the surgeons?

PATIENT P884
Um it's been a while.

DOCTOR P884
It's been a while.

PATIENT P884
@@@.

DOCTOR P884
Well when was the last time you got it drained?

PATIENT P884
Hmm February.

DOCTOR P884
February.

PATIENT P884
February, March.

DOCTOR P884
Okay.  Do you smoke?

PATIENT P884
No.

DOCTOR P884
Okay very good.  I'm gonna take a listen to you.  @@@.  Did you get your flu shot this year?

PATIENT P884
Uh yeah I got it at my job.

DOCTOR P884
Okay, perfect.  Do you need any refills on your blood pressure medicine?

PATIENT P884
Uh yeah you can.

DOCTOR P884
Okay. Want to get it mailed to you?

PATIENT P884

DOCTOR P884
Does it feel full, like fluid or?

PATIENT P884
I just feel like almost it's uh @@@.

DOCTOR P884
Okay.

PATIENT P884
I'm not sure I be feeling like that but then it puffed out again.

DOCTOR P884
Do you feel fuller, is it painful?

PATIENT P884
No I ain't full.

DOCTOR P884
Okay.

PATIENT P884
It's still, like maybe it's like my stomach gets to growling @@@.

DOCTOR P884
Uh-huh.  Any swelling in your legs?

PATIENT P884
No.  That's a little, like @@@.

DOCTOR P884
Just a little @@@.

PATIENT P884
Yeah I think.  

DOCTOR P884
Let me go check a couple of things and I'll be back okay.

PATIENT P884
You want to take a look at the uh?

DOCTOR P884
Yeah I @@@ take a look at it.  Go ahead @@@@.  Has it gotten bigger do you think?

PATIENT P884
It was hard, it’s still big like, but not as high as it was. It’s right here.

DOCTOR P884
Right there?

PATIENT P884
Yeah.

DOCTOR P884
Okay.  You don't have any other ones that you're aware of?

PATIENT P884
Well I usually get them like in here.

DOCTOR P884
Up in the groin.  Yeah right in here, right.

PATIENT P884
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR P884
You don't have anything there.

PATIENT P884
Just this thing here.

DOCTOR P884
There’s no lesion on your penis? You never had a lesion or anything like that.

PATIENT P884
I got little bumps on the tip like that.

DOCTOR P884
Let me see.  Have you always had that?

PATIENT P884
Yeah.

DOCTOR P884
Is that, that's not new.

PATIENT P884
Uh uh.

DOCTOR P884
Yeah if it’s going back down @@@ Surgery to go look at it or um just wait for it to go down, whatever you want.  Uh that area is a little bit harder to drain if it's that small.

PATIENT P884
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P884
You know what I mean.

PATIENT P884
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P884
It's a little bit harder if it's that small but um it's something I can refer you @@@, no problem.  Or we can wait and see if it goes down @@@ about it.  

PATIENT P884
Okay.

DOCTOR P884
What do you want to do?  

PATIENT P884
I can wait.

DOCTOR P884
Yeah so @@@ it seems pretty superficial.

PATIENT P884
Okay.

DOCTOR P884
They just have to be careful when they drain it.

PATIENT P884
Yeah.

DOCTOR P884
And if it's going down, maybe not mess with it right now.  It's a pretty invasive procedure and that's a pretty @@@ area.  I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  19:44  DOCTOR IN:  27:20)

DOCTOR P884
Alright sir.  So in terms of constant diarrhea I'm not quite sure what else you can do from the General Medicine Clinic other than reinforce the fiber, things that we’ve told you before so I know you’re going back to the GI doctors too so um.  @@@ back to the Surgery Clinic and maybe have them take a look at it and see if it does get bigger, to have it at least looked at you know and they can compare it and then uh for your blood pressure, let's see.  One of the numbers is a little bit high today and I was wondering if we should go up on one of your medicines.  Yeah, cause even the lower number has been a little bit on the higher side and so the metoprolol you take 25 mg twice a day?

PATIENT P884
Yeah half pills.

DOCTOR P884
Yeah why don't go to a whole pill?

PATIENT P884
Okay.

DOCTOR P884
Okay and then if it makes you dizzy then drop back to a half a pill and then come back in.

PATIENT P884
Okay.

DOCTOR P884
Okay I need to put it into the system for you and you have two refills of the hydrochlorothiazide so I'll go ahead and refill it as well.  And then, other than that I think that's everything.  You got your flu shot and everything.

PATIENT P884
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P884
So I'll have you go back up there and make an appointment with the General Surgery Clinic, the door to where you check in.

PATIENT P884
Alright.

DOCTOR P884
And then you'll go there.  The next time I see you um, which will probably be in three or four months or so, go ahead and go to the Lab before you come in and get a cholesterol panel done.

PATIENT P884
Cholesterol panel?

DOCTOR P884
Yeah it's a cholesterol level, you just do it once a year.  You had it in November of last year and did you eat lunch or breakfast today?

PATIENT P884
No.

DOCTOR P884
Well we can do then today if you want; if you don't want to we'll have you do it when you come back, whichever one you would prefer.

PATIENT P884
Uh I'll get it cause I'm here.

DOCTOR P884
Okay, I'll put in to do that do that today.  

PATIENT P884
Okay. 

DOCTOR P884
@@@.

PATIENT P884
So where do I go to get those done?

DOCTOR P884
Right across the hall here.  Right across the hall, go to the Lab.

PATIENT P884
Oh the Lab okay.

DOCTOR P884
@@@ you have a nice day.

PATIENT P884
Alright thanks.
