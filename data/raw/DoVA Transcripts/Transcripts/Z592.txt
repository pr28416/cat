DOCTOR Z592
PATIENT?

PATIENT Z592 
That's me.

DOCTOR Z592
Hi, come on back.  @@@.

PATIENT Z592
You said PATIENT, @@@

DOCTOR Z592
Yeah PATIENT.

PATIENT Z592
Oh alright.

DOCTOR Z592
Good.  I'm DOCTOR; I'm one of the residents.  Sorry about the wait.  Come on back this way.  So it looks like the last time you were here you saw DOCTOR.  So you can just have a seat right over here.

PATIENT Z592
Okay.

DOCTOR Z592
And it looks like, frankly, things are doing pretty good, so all I see that last time we started you on some the cholesterol medicine and a aspirin, is that right?

PATIENT Z592
Repeat that again.

DOCTOR Z592
The last time you were here everything was going good.

PATIENT Z592
Yes.

DOCTOR Z592
They got some blood work so you were started on a cholesterol medicine.

PATIENT Z592
Yes.

DOCTOR Z592
Okay and a aspirin.

PATIENT Z592
Yes.

DOCTOR Z592
And that's it.

PATIENT Z592
Yep.

DOCTOR Z592
So you're only on four medicines it looks like.  You're on propranolol for your blood pressure, you're on Flomax for your prostate, you're on simvastatin for your cholesterol and you're on aspirin for prevention and that's it right?

PATIENT Z592
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z592
And how are you feeling?

PATIENT Z592
Alright.

DOCTOR Z592
Good.  Now we probably don't have to do anything.  Oh so it looks like uh last time you were here that your blood pressure medicine was switched from propranolol to metoprolol twice a day.

PATIENT Z592
Yeah I take a half pill.

DOCTOR Z592
Perfect.  So your blood pressure today looks fine.  Do you have a home blood pressure cuff to check your blood pressures?

PATIENT Z592
No.

DOCTOR Z592
So let's give you one of those cause you know sometimes your first number when you got here was a little bit high.

PATIENT Z592
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z592
Being at the doctor's office tends to make people nervous so instead of us going up on your medicines, if your blood pressure at home is fine we'll just check your blood pressure.

PATIENT Z592
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z592
At home and then we just leave things as they are.  And thankfully, at your age you're doing so well, there probably isn't a whole lot else that we need to do.  Let's see if there is anything on our reminders list.  They gave you a flu shot today which is great, excellent.

PATIENT Z592
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z592
Let me note that so that, yes so remember things, good, see if there's anything on our reminders list as far as special things.  Uh let's see, do you think you've ever had a tetanus shot.  When do you think the tetanus shot was, do you know, do not know?  Tetanus shot. 

PATIENT Z592
I don't know if I ever had a tetanus shot.

DOCTOR Z592
Are you interested in a tetanus shot?

PATIENT Z592
What is it I'd like to know?

DOCTOR Z592
So basically tetanus, like if you would step on a rusty nail you could probably get a tetanus infection where basically all of the muscles in your body kind of lock and you end up not being able to breathe so if you feel like it's pretty unlikely that you would step on a rusty nail or get bitten by an animal then you can go ahead and defer it but we recommend if for everybody just in case.  Might as well right?  Cause it couldn't hurt.  So we'll put that in, so let the nurse give that to you.  And then uh you quit smoking right?

PATIENT Z592
I never smoked.

DOCTOR Z592
Never smoked.

PATIENT Z592
Oh wait a minute, I did.  I haven't smoked in over 50 years.

DOCTOR Z592
Amazing, good, good, good, good.  Let's keep up that good work and let's see, we talked about this.  And do you live by yourself?

PATIENT Z592
Yes.

DOCTOR Z592
Good, wow and you do everything on your own?

PATIENT Z592
Yes.

DOCTOR Z592
Good.  That's more than I can say for lots of people my own age who seem to need a lot more help, good.  So that is good news definitely.  And as far as, so you're on the medication to help with your prostate uh are you getting up a lot at night to pee or are you sleeping okay through the night?

PATIENT Z592
No I get up maybe four times a night.

DOCTOR Z592
You're getting up, does that bother you?

PATIENT Z592
No I'm used to it.

DOCTOR Z592
Okay.  I mean we could certainly send you to the urologist.  We could change the medicines around if you want but if you don't care then we don't care.  It's up to you.

PATIENT Z592
It's alright.

DOCTOR Z592
Okay good and let's see you're scheduled to see the eye doctors it looks like in a couple of weeks.

PATIENT Z592
That's on the 6th.

DOCTOR Z592
Perfect and you saw the hearing doctors last week.

PATIENT Z592
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z592
And they made some adjustments.

PATIENT Z592
They did, they gave me my hearing aids.  However I got to go back.

DOCTOR Z592
Oh, okay good.  So let me just take a quick look and then we'll have the nurse give you your shot and we'll get out of here.  We don't need to keep healthy people at the doctor's office, you got more important things to do.

PATIENT Z592
Okay what you gonna give me that tetanus shot?

DOCTOR Z592
Oh the nurse is.  I'm just going to take a quick look and a listen to your heart and lungs.

PATIENT Z592
Okay.

DOCTOR Z592
Good.  Let me see if the nurse is free.  I'll walk you right over there and get your shots and then we'll get you out of here.  Do you have enough of all your medicines at home?  Do you need refills?

PATIENT Z592
Uh.  No I'm alright yeah.

DOCTOR Z592
Okay so then the only thing today that you are gonna need to do is to go up to Prosthetics and pick up a home blood pressure cuff.  So that's on the third floor of this building here.

PATIENT Z592
Oh okay.

DOCTOR Z592
In the Ogden Building, so we'll have you do that.  Let me order this for you.

PATIENT Z592
Now are there instructions on that and how to use the thing?

DOCTOR Z592
Uh they'll show you.  You just put your arm in it and I think it's automatic.  They'll show you when you pick it up.  Let me go see if the nurse is free, I'll get you over here, we'll get you out of here, I'll be right back.

PATIENT Z592
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  70:17  DOCTOR IN:  74:18)

DOCTOR Z592
Alright, so let’s walk you around for your tetanus shot.  So we're going to go this way.  @@@  Oh don’t forget your hat, yeah.  So you can come around this way, we'll drop you where the nurse’s desk and you get that blood pressure cuff and you are out of here.  I'll make sure you have enough refills until your next appointment.  @@@ one more time.  You @@@ we'll have you wait right over here.  You can just stand wait here, should I get you a chair, do you feel like you can hang out here okay?  Well you just have to sit back out in the waiting area and they said they'll call you.  

PATIENT LEAVES:  75:33.
