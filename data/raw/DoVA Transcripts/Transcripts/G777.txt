DOCTOR G777
Hmm, I think that might be a little too much for you.  And how much are you taking at lunch, I mean you're taking 74 plus three times a day, you give yourself shots?

PATIENT G777
Twice a day.

DOCTOR G777
Twice a day, what time?

PATIENT G777
In the morning and at bedtime.

DOCTOR G777
With regular insulin or with Aspart?

PATIENT G777
Who?

DOCTOR G777
Which kind of insulin, Aspart or regular?

PATIENT G777
I guess I do regular.

DOCTOR G777
Regular.  So you get that in the morning and at lunch time are you feeling lightheaded?  You have a lot of low readings around lunch.

PATIENT G777
Well see actually I don't get up till around 11 o'clock.

DOCTOR G777
Okay.

PATIENT G777
So then I'm up to eat at 12 o'clock.

DOCTOR G777
What time are you, so let me understand.  At night what time do you give yourself the shots, the 74?

PATIENT G777
At 10 o'clock.

DOCTOR G777
10 p.m.?

PATIENT G777
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G777
And before you give yourself the 74 you take your sugars right?

PATIENT G777
Yes.

DOCTOR G777
Okay and that's the Lantus and then let me see what else you're taking, hold on.  And then regular.  How much are you doing of regular?

PATIENT G777
5 in the morning and 8 at night.

DOCTOR G777
Okay.  I think we're gonna have to take you down a little bit.  So before this week you were doing 70 of Lantus at night?

PATIENT G777
Yeah.

DOCTOR G777
And you were over 200 and now you're in the 50s?  Hmm.  How's the diet been?

PATIENT G777
Same, exactly the same.

DOCTOR G777
Are you taking all your blood pressure pills?

PATIENT G777
Yep.

DOCTOR G777
And what time to do you take the 8 at night of regular?

PATIENT G777
About 10 o'clock.

DOCTOR G777
Oh why are you taking it at 10?

PATIENT G777
Cause that's when I go to bed.

DOCTOR G777
Well you should take the 74 at 10 and then you take the regular before dinner.  What time do you eat dinner?

PATIENT G777
I eat dinner around 8 o'clock, 7 or 8 o'clock.

DOCTOR G777
Okay.  So I think that we need to change when you're taking it okay.  And what time do you take the 5?

PATIENT G777
Once in the morning.

DOCTOR G777
What time in the morning?

PATIENT G777
Whenever I wake up, 12 o'clock, 11 or 12 o'clock.

DOCTOR G777
Even though your sugars are so low like that?

PATIENT G777
I donâ€™t get out of bed until 11:30 - 12 o'clock.

DOCTOR G777
Okay.  I'm not trying to, I'm trying to make it so you don't have real low sugars cause I don't want, it's dangerous to be hypoglycemic right.  I want to make sure that we're taking care of you.  So you give yourself one shot at night at 10.

PATIENT G777
Yes.

DOCTOR G777
Or you give yourself two shots at 10?

PATIENT G777
One shot.

DOCTOR G777
One shot of the 74?

PATIENT G777
Yeah.

DOCTOR G777
And then you wake up in the morning and then before breakfast do you give yourself the 5?

PATIENT G777
Yes the 5 and the 74.

DOCTOR G777
But the 74 you said you give at night right?

PATIENT G777
I do that twice a day.

DOCTOR G777
Oh you do the 74 twice a day.

PATIENT G777
Yes.

DOCTOR G777
So when you wake up at about 10, let's say 10 a.m., 10 to 11 a.m. you give yourself the 74.

PATIENT G777
Plus 5.

DOCTOR G777
Plus 5 and then again at 10 you give yourself the 74 plus 8.

PATIENT G777
74 plus 8.

DOCTOR G777
Plus 8 okay.  But you don't eat after.

PATIENT G777
No.  I eat before.

DOCTOR G777
I think we're gonna have to change the way. Is that how they told you to take it?

PATIENT G777
I been taking it that way since I been on it.

DOCTOR G777
Because your blood sugars, see the 5 and the 8 are supposed to be covering you for your meals.  Do you have breakfast every day when you wake up?

PATIENT G777
No.

DOCTOR G777
Do you eat lunch?

PATIENT G777
Yes.

DOCTOR G777
What time do you eat lunch?

PATIENT G777
When I get up.

DOCTOR G777
Okay so you get up in the morning and you eat something.

PATIENT G777
Yeah.

DOCTOR G777
Okay.  And then so you only have two meals a day?

PATIENT G777
Basically.

DOCTOR G777
And then you have your dinner.

PATIENT G777
Yeah.

DOCTOR G777
Okay.  Alright.  Let me think about how we're gonna change this so that you don't get these lows cause I don't want you to get these lows you know.  Cause it's dangerous and you're feeling it right.

PATIENT G777
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G777

PATIENT G777
I don't know.

DOCTOR G777
Let me see.  Uh I don't know how to find it.  Hold on; let me ask DOCTOR how I find when it was.  This is for you.  The other thing that I wanted you to do is your nighttime insulin, I want you to take you before you eat dinner instead of at 10 okay.  So take your morning in the morning like you've been doing.  Have your breakfast or lunch or whatever meal you eat.  Then take your nighttime insulin before dinner okay.  And make sure you check your sugars and if you're still getting those lows in the morning then I want you to drop back down to 70 instead of 74. Does that sound like a plan?

PATIENT G777
Okay.

DOCTOR G777
And I want you to come back and see our pharmacist in 1-2 weeks, okay?  And then I want you to see me in three months and I'm just going to order some urine tests for you, okay?  And I think everything else is good.

PATIENT G777
Twice.

DOCTOR G777
Okay.  Well you can take it up to four times a day.

PATIENT G777
Okay.

DOCTOR G777
See if that'll help.  The other thing is on this I'm gonna have to put that you have HIV and hepatitis B cause they are communicable diseases, that means like if you were to get hurt and start bleeding then you know.

PATIENT G777
That's all VA.

DOCTOR G777
Okay I just wanted you to know.  Okay let me figure out how to find out about your tetanus alright, I'll be right back.
