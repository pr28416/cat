It kept it too moist and it kept it itchy.

SECOND DOCTOR F688
Did it make it better?

PATIENT F688

SECOND DOCTOR F688
No.  I don't think this is fungal. @@@I think we should try a little topical steroid and get him in to see Dermatology because they may need to biopsy this.

FIRST DOCTOR F688
@@@ for dermatitis from just.

SECOND DOCTOR F688
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR F688
This kind of treat him like that.

PATIENT F688
And there's just a lot of fluid that's been coming out of it.

SECOND DOCTOR F688
So what I would do is I would give him like @@@ cream 1%.

FIRST DOCTOR F688
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR F688
Apply that twice a day and right in the small of your back, is it itchy?

PATIENT F688
It's burning and itchy.

@@@ that's where it is. @@@ in his pants line too and a little bit higher.

SECOND DOCTOR F688

FIRST DOCTOR F688
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR F688
So I'm want to, or at least a little bit. We should have seen something. So, if you've only been putting the steroids @@@ and does your back get better with the steroids @@@?

PATIENT F688
Just a little bit.

SECOND DOCTOR F688
Okay, let's put, I'm going to give you some different steroids for here and on your back twice a day.  I want to get you into Dermatology.

PATIENT F688
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR F688
And ask them.  Now the problem that I see is that if it becomes infected.  Now see some of these lesions that are open and weeping and what happens is that bacteria comes in and causes infection.  Do you know what that feels like?  It will be stinky, fevers, chills.

PATIENT F688
That's what I'm getting, fevers.

SECOND DOCTOR F688
You're getting fevers, how high?
