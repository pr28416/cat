DOCTOR S440
Well let me see it.

PATIENT S440
That's why I just stopped it.

DOCTOR S440
Hmm.  How long have you noticed that the sugars have been high?

PATIENT S440
About, off and on, for the past two months.

DOCTOR S440
Two months they've been higher.  And you had 186 today when we got labs.  Your hemoglobin A1c was a little, let me see what's it's been in the past first.  I'm going to have to look it up.

PATIENT S440
Right.

DOCTOR S440
But it was considerably running a little bit higher.  Right?

PATIENT S440
Yeah.

DOCTOR S440
And they asked when I called you and saw you in the ED, were you in the Emergency Department?

PATIENT S440
Right.

DOCTOR S440
What was the story about that?

PATIENT S440
That was a racing heart.

DOCTOR S440
Racing heart.  How has that been?  Have you had that anymore?

PATIENT S440
No because they told me I was dehydrated.

DOCTOR S440

DOCTOR S440

PATIENT S440
And uh my pulse was 123.

DOCTOR S440

DOCTOR S440
No they didn't do it, did they tell you to increase it there or no?

PATIENT S440
No, no, she didn't no.  But she said maybe I should.

DOCTOR S440

PATIENT S440

DOCTOR S440
Did you feel that day, when you, do you feel like your heart was beating fast or racing?

PATIENT S440
I did yes.

DOCTOR S440
You did.  Did it come on all of a sudden or did it come on kind of gradually.

PATIENT S440
Well it was when I got up.

DOCTOR S440
As soon as you got up you noticed it?

PATIENT S440
As soon as I got up yeah.

DOCTOR S440
Had you ever had anything like that, feeling like that before?

PATIENT S440
I had.  I had uh I think once before I had that but I didn't pay any attention to it.

DOCTOR S440
You didn't.

PATIENT S440
It doesn't last, you know it goes away.

DOCTOR S440
Yeah, so how long did you have it that day cause when you got to the ED it looks like the heart rate was back to.

PATIENT S440
Right.

DOCTOR S440
Near normal.

PATIENT S440
Yeah.  Right.  That's how it's been, that's how it was.  Uh, it would last maybe half hour, an hour.

DOCTOR S440
And then go away?

PATIENT S440
And then go away yeah.

DOCTOR S440
How fast was it going?  Did you check it when you woke up that morning?

PATIENT S440
Yeah it was 123.

DOCTOR S440
Yeah you were definitely @@@@ dehydrated when you came in.

PATIENT S440
Right.

DOCTOR S440
It looks like your orthostatic you recall when they did the tests.

PATIENT S440
Now the other thing that uh, I get Prilosec and I know that the side effects of Prilosec is a fast heart rate.

DOCTOR S440
It can, yeah.

PATIENT S440
Uh DOCTOR prescribed it.

DOCTOR S440
How long ago?

PATIENT S440
I've been on them for the past year.

DOCTOR S440
Okay.  It shouldn't, I wouldn't expect it to uh.

PATIENT S440
To do that.

DOCTOR S440
Do that.  No the way it sounds, it sounds like more like you were possibly be dehydrated more than anything.

PATIENT S440
Right.

DOCTOR S440
Since you responded well with just the fluids and especially with all this urinating and stuff.  You're probably losing some glucose out your urine.

PATIENT S440
Right.

DOCTOR S440
Which is why you're peeing in your urine.

PATIENT S440
Yeah they told me that yeah, right.

DOCTOR S440
Um so that's probably whatâ€™s going on here, yeah.  But no fevers, chills?

PATIENT S440
No.

DOCTOR S440
No belly pain @@@?

PATIENT S440
No nothing, nothing at all no.

DOCTOR S440
Nothing like that.  Let me look you over here once, just sit over here for me.  Some deep breaths for me.  Open your mouth for me.  You didn't have any episodes of low blood sugars have you?

PATIENT S440
No.

DOCTOR S440
No low.

PATIENT S440
No I haven't, no.

DOCTOR S440
Okay.  What's the lowest reading you had would you say?  @@@?

PATIENT S440
Yeah I think on that, I was under 100 yeah.

DOCTOR S440
Under 100 okay.

PATIENT S440
87.

DOCTOR S440
80s okay but nothing like low 60s.

PATIENT S440
No, no, nothing like that.

DOCTOR S440
Nothing like that okay.  Let me have you lay back here.  I'm going to push on your belly a little bit.  No pain there?

PATIENT S440
No.

DOCTOR S440
Sit you back up.  Go ahead and have a seat back over here.  Just looking to see if there are bulges in here and I just want to make sure, yeah @@@.  Did they do an EKG when you were in there?

PATIENT S440
They did.

DOCTOR S440
Let me look at that real quick.  I'm going to go chat with one of the attending doctors here.

PATIENT S440
Okay.

DOCTOR S440
And we'll come up with a plan for you okay.

PATIENT S440
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  39:20  DOCTOR IN:  48:50)

DOCTOR S440
So when you urinate do you feel like you're totally emptying when you do go?

PATIENT S440
Yes I do.

DOCTOR S440
Okay, so it doesn't feel like it's a prostate problem.  Cause I didn't know if you were feeling like you're fully emptying it.

PATIENT S440
No I have no problem area.

DOCTOR S440
Do you see the urologist here?

PATIENT S440
Yes I do yeah.

DOCTOR S440
And your prostate level is going up.  I know that you've had biopsies and all that before so I'll just let them follow up with that.

PATIENT S440
Right.

DOCTOR S440
When you see them the next time.  Um so I think two things I want to do today.  They didn't do a urine sample?  Did they do a urine sample on you?

PATIENT S440
No they didn't do that.

DOCTOR S440
So I think just because, I don't think you have a urinary tract infection but urinary infections can cause you to go to the bathroom a lot.

PATIENT S440
Right.

DOCTOR S440
So I think you should go down to the Lab and just give a urine sample and make sure you don't have infection.

PATIENT S440
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S440
That's causing it.  Um and then otherwise I think it's probably likely due to the sugars so we're going to start going up, you're taking 5 of glipizide in the morning only, we're going to start take 5 in the morning and 5 at night.

PATIENT S440
Okay.

DOCTOR S440
You keep track and see where your sugars are you know and kind of keep track of them and a couple weeks of doing that if you're still going a lot, urinating real frequently and having higher, I want to have you actually call in and talk to the nurse and kind of let her know what you've been doing.

PATIENT S440
Right, right.

DOCTOR S440
Um and then if that's still high we still have some room and we can go up a little bit more.

PATIENT S440
Okay.

DOCTOR S440
On the medication but we'll start, you kind of go slowly up with this cause you can have low blood sugars if you go up too fast.

PATIENT S440
I see.

DOCTOR S440
We'll go up to 5 now in the morning and 5 at night.

PATIENT S440
Five before I go to bed?

DOCTOR S440
Yeah, evening.

PATIENT S440
Evening yeah.

DOCTOR S440
You know whenever you take your pills.

PATIENT S440
Oh okay yeah.

DOCTOR S440
That would be before you go to bed; it can be you know whenever.

PATIENT S440
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR S440
Sometime when you feel on schedule anyway.

PATIENT S440
Right.

DOCTOR S440
And then stop down to the Lab today and get a urine @@@.

PATIENT S440
Okay.

DOCTOR S440
And if there is an infection I'll call you and we'll put you on antibiotics.

PATIENT S440
Right.

DOCTOR S440
But @@@ if it's not.

PATIENT S440
Right, yeah.

DOCTOR S440
Medicine.

PATIENT S440
Okay.  Um, how do I get a pair of diabetic shoes?

DOCTOR S440
Oh diabetic shoes?

PATIENT S440
I have them at home but I've had them for two years and they're worn down in the back.

DOCTOR S440
Sure.

PATIENT S440
You know so, the heels, I don't wear them anymore.

DOCTOR S440
So, let's see.  You got them through the VA?  Did you get them through the VA before, the shoes?

PATIENT S440
No I paid for myself.  I got it from uh Medicare.

DOCTOR S440
Medicare.

PATIENT S440
Yeah.

DOCTOR S440
I could send you to the Prosthetics Division here that.

PATIENT S440
Oh okay.

DOCTOR S440
Let me put it in and just check your medications.  Also if you have anymore of those episodes where you have the real fast heartbeat, let us know that.

PATIENT S440
Okay.

DOCTOR S440
And keep on the fluids you know.  Stop down today and get that and the medications, I changed it in here but you have the same pills.  You can just take them and you should get more.

PATIENT S440
Okay.

DOCTOR S440
I'll do the refills.  Uh and then I'll follow up with you if you need to be put on antibiotics or something.

PATIENT S440

PATIENT S440

DOCTOR S440
No they'll have to call you.  I put in a consult.

PATIENT S440
Oh.

DOCTOR S440
So they'll probably call you.

PATIENT S440
Oh good.

DOCTOR S440
To schedule that yeah.

PATIENT S440
