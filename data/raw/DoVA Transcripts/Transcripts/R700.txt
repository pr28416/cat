DOCTOR R700
Good.  Okay. 

PATIENT R700
I was unable to get the blood drawn last night or this morning because of traffic this morning.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
I come all the way from De Kalb so.

DOCTOR R700
Okay, let me put it in for you.  Is that okay?

PATIENT R700
That's fine.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.  What would you like today?

PATIENT R700
Uh I need, I haven't been here in quite a while.  In fact I haven't been here since DOCTOR.

DOCTOR R700
Okay and he left over a year ago okay.

PATIENT R700
But uh and when I had put in for my medication uh some of them were denied so and apparently they changed the rules or something where I have to go.  I have uh mild PTSD.

DOCTOR R700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R700
And anxiety so they had me on Paxil.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
On low dose Paxil and lorazepam in case I have any.

DOCTOR R700
Do you see Mental Health at all or not?

PATIENT R700
No I've never.

DOCTOR R700
Or the doctor just renewed it.

PATIENT R700
DOCTOR just renewed it. 

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
He's the one that started it for me.

DOCTOR R700
Oh really okay.

PATIENT R700
So.  I'm gonna go with @@@.  So @@@ best doctor I’ve had in the 14 years I've been here so.

DOCTOR R700
Really?  So you only have me for a year cause I took over this clinic last year when I was a second year resident so I'm graduating @@@ check out today I'm only going have you come back in a year so you might see somebody different.

PATIENT R700
Well I'm a teacher so they used to have me coming every three months to get blood tests but I just.

DOCTOR R700
That's alright.

PATIENT R700
I was supposed to be on gemfibrozil and niacin as well but neither of those were renewed either so.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
I still have some so I still use the gemfibrozil and I had high triglycerides is one other thing and low cholesterol.  

DOCTOR R700
Okay um any problems today that you'd like to address.  Or just kinda of want to get your meds checked today.

PATIENT R700
Well I have something my wife told me to ask you about.  She's a nurse in De Kalb.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
But her father has had bouts with skin cancer and I got these bumps that kind of started, well I got a couple on each one of my hands.  But they're irregular shaped and.

DOCTOR R700
They don't look like skin cancer to me.

PATIENT R700
Well she said I might need to have Dermatology check it.

DOCTOR R700
So if it's like one color, usually it's a skin color, it's like different colors.

PATIENT R700
So this is just it.

DOCTOR R700
And it's irregular.

PATIENT R700
The skin tags I keep getting.

DOCTOR R700
Maybe.  If you do have skin tags that you get.

PATIENT R700
I do get skin tags.

DOCTOR R700
And do they start out looking like that?

PATIENT R700
No.

DOCTOR R700
They don't.

PATIENT R700
They just come up like little skin tags and then they just get bigger and bigger.

DOCTOR R700
Okay so how long has it been that size?

PATIENT R700
Uh it just got, I just grew these this summer.

DOCTOR R700
So just this summer.  I feel like they might even just be freckles.  If they continue to get bigger then you call in to see any doctor and at that time you can be referred to Derm.  I don't think that looks like skin cancer.  It doesn't even look like basal cell and what do you do, are you always out in the sun all the time?

PATIENT R700
I spend a lot of time out in the sun.

DOCTOR R700
You do.

PATIENT R700
I have two daughters and since I'm a teacher, I spend the entire summer taking care of them.

DOCTOR R700
Okay, okay and then anyone else in your family, in your blood relatives have anything like this?

PATIENT R700
I don't really, I don't really keep contact with my family much so.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
I don't think so.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
We have more bone cancer.

DOCTOR R700
Do you burn when you go in the sun or do you?

PATIENT R700
Uh maybe once in a great while.

DOCTOR R700
Do you tan more than you burn?

PATIENT R700
Mostly I tan yeah.

DOCTOR R700
Okay so that's a good thing.  That means it's less likely that.  Cause usually people who burn have a higher susceptibility to cancer.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
People who tan naturally, outside of black people and Indian people don't get skin cancer.  It's very rare if we do.  That's because we tan, we don't burn okay.  I mean there's a mechanism for that but I don't think that looks like skin cancer.  That looks almost like a mole to me.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
Okay. But keep an eye on it though.  If you think it’s getting bigger and it looks different then for sure it needd to go.

PATIENT R700
Right.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.  Um yeah so just definitely keep an eye on it.  I could send you now but I'm pretty sure.

PATIENT R700
I had so much other stuff happening right now with my knee messed up.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.  Why don't we, so why don't you keep an eye on that and have your wife keep an eye on that okay?

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
Um and in the next 20 minutes or so what else do you want to address for today?  Cause we can actually have a six-month follow-up, I won't do the yearly follow-up.  We can do every three months for now.

PATIENT R700
Well the three months would be excessive.  I'm a teacher right now and then I'm missing a day of school for today.

DOCTOR R700
Okay, okay.

PATIENT R700
So for me to be here.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
In the and frankly it's harder for me to be gone from school than it is for me to be here.

DOCTOR R700
What do you teach?

PATIENT R700
I'm a chemistry teacher.

DOCTOR R700
Oh okay at a private school?

PATIENT R700
Yeah.

DOCTOR R700
Okay cool.  Um what else, what is it, tell me the three things that are bothering you the most and we'll try to address those today.

PATIENT R700
Well my neck always seems to bother me, that's why I'm here, so I'm in the VA System.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
Uh lower back has always bothered me.

DOCTOR R700
So no chronic issues then?

PATIENT R700
Yeah those are chronic.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
But I worry about, I've had a lot of anxiety attacks.  I think I've had more not having medicine and I think it might be because I don't have medicine.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.  That we'll take care like I said.

PATIENT R700
That's huge.

DOCTOR R700
So that's the big thing was medicine.

PATIENT R700
Yeah I'm worried about the meds.  That's a big chunk of that.

DOCTOR R700
We'll give you your meds today don't worry. 

PATIENT R700
And then my knee, which I'm already in the system with Ortho for.

DOCTOR R700
Okay so the plan for today our main thing is to make sure all your meds are in line.

PATIENT R700
Exactly.

DOCTOR R700
And make sure you have enough of everything.

PATIENT R700
And so you might actually get ahead of the schedule which is rare for me.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah so actually they've actually been really good on medicines, so really they've changed a lot around with how the clinics are running, especially the Gen Med clinics.  They made it a lot easier for us and hired a lot more nursing staff who are very good now and like, so it's almost like Loyola.

PATIENT R700
Well we used to have some that they were mad that we were here and we're like wait a minute, we're the veterans which is why you have a job you know.

DOCTOR R700
Right, right, exactly, who the doctors or the nurses?

PATIENT R700
It's so fun.  The nurses, the nurses.

DOCTOR R700
No.  At least my team here is very good.  They're a lot better with everything now okay.

PATIENT R700
And this one, I've never had a problem General Medical.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah.

PATIENT R700
It's the people that used to be what they called Pod 4.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
Back in the old days.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
Where they'd make you go all the way down four blocks.

DOCTOR R700
Oh really.

PATIENT R700
It seems to get you to the clinic.

DOCTOR R700
Alright.

PATIENT R700
They were nasty to the vets.

DOCTOR R700
Okay so right now it shows that you don't have any @@@.  The hydrocodone, tramadol. 

PATIENT R700
And the hydrocodone is for my knee.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
I actually need to renew that one somehow.

DOCTOR R700
Okay I can renew that.  You're on tramadol for pain.

PATIENT R700
Yeah that's supposed to be to supplement the meloxicam cause they told me I can't any more than one meloxicam and no other NSAIDs.

DOCTOR R700
Right.

PATIENT R700
And then when the pain gets worse I have to take tramadol.

DOCTOR R700
Right.

PATIENT R700
So I've, my first neck surgery failed and then the vertebra pinched on the, they didn't put the metal plate in the first surgery.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
So the vertebra pinched on the brachial path of the nerves.

DOCTOR R700
Okay, okay.

PATIENT R700
So I have permanent nerve damage and I constantly in a spasm in my left shoulder and down my arm.

DOCTOR R700
Hmm.

PATIENT R700
So the reason I have the long term, which it's been really, really long term meds which I know it's not supposed to be recommended.

DOCTOR R700
Right.

PATIENT R700
But we've gone through every NSAID that there is.

DOCTOR R700
Do you eat something @@@?

PATIENT R700
Oh yeah.  That's the only one that hasn't killed my stomach yet.

DOCTOR R700
Okay, alright.  So I'll renew these meds and then we'll go back through your old meds and see what you need to get okay.  Um @@@.

PATIENT R700
I will warn you, whenever you put in gemfibrozil, for some reason they always like over send me.

DOCTOR R700
Oh really.

PATIENT R700
They tell me that I'm supposed to be running out but I still have more.  I don't know how I take it, like @@@.

DOCTOR R700
We're going to change it to a 90-day supply alrighty.  

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
So you'll have a 90 day supply.  Do you want me to mail it or do you want to pick them up?

PATIENT R700
I usually get them mailed.

DOCTOR R700
You want them mailed today.

PATIENT R700
I still have a little bit of everything except for the head medicine.

DOCTOR R700
Okay so the hydrocodone I don't think they'll give you more than a 30-day supply so.

PATIENT R700
That's fine.  Just so you might have an insight for other patients.

DOCTOR R700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R700
When people who have the PTSD and that anxiety, when we have to go over to the Medical Clinic there are some doctors that treat us like pariah because of that.

DOCTOR R700
Really.

PATIENT R700
It just happens.  When I had, after my first neck surgery I told them something wasn't right and one of the attendings from Neurosurgery said, no from Ortho, he said maybe we need to send you back over to the Mental Health so that you can actually see what's really wrong with you.  Then next week Neurosurgery checked it out and they put me, I had surgery within a couple weeks after that.

DOCTOR R700
Hmm.

PATIENT R700
So I have a hard time with anything going over to Mental Health.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
Because of that stigma that.  I'm by far, I'm not crazy.

DOCTOR R700
No, no, no.

PATIENT R700
You know when other doctors treat me like that.

DOCTOR R700
I know.

PATIENT R700
It makes me not want anything to do with that malarkey. 

DOCTOR R700
Not the system, but here, Mental Health here is really good.

PATIENT R700
Oh yeah I know they're good.

DOCTOR R700
With like, even when it comes to basic anxiety to like severe depression.

PATIENT R700
My thing is um.

DOCTOR R700
But they treat everybody.

PATIENT R700
My thing isn't so much with the Mental Health.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
It's with the other doctors who treat patients like.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
Well he's still in pain because he's crazy.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
That's, that's just too much.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah I understand.

PATIENT R700
You know I'm a highly educated person; I don't appreciate being called crazy because I'm in pain.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT R700
You know by somebody who's never served a day in his life in the military.

DOCTOR R700
Do you teach AP chemistry?

PATIENT R700
I do not teach AP.  I prefer conceptual chemistry so I teach the general level.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
But at the school I teach at my conceptual general level can beat most of the AP levels in most schools in the state.

DOCTOR R700
Okay great.

PATIENT R700
Naperville north is no joke when it comes to science.

DOCTOR R700
So @@@ oh really.  Those kids are really smart.  

PATIENT R700
That's who I teach.  

DOCTOR R700
Wow.

PATIENT R700
All the really, really smart ones.

DOCTOR R700
Do you teach any of the Indian kids cause @@@.

PATIENT R700
I do, I do.  I'm also a model UN advisor.

DOCTOR R700
Oh really oh wow.  I did not know that.

PATIENT R700
And we'll be teaching applications in chemistry.

DOCTOR R700
@@@ are not funny.  @@@.

PATIENT R700
No.

DOCTOR R700
I feel like you don't make enough.

PATIENT R700
I have to live in De Kalb for what I make.

DOCTOR R700
Really.

PATIENT R700
And it bothers me too, especially when the.

DOCTOR R700
I always had teachers because like in India teachers are highly regarded.

PATIENT R700
Regarded exactly.

DOCTOR R700
Like as doctors, lawyers and teachers are like.

PATIENT R700
Well, in a lot of places, that’s how it is.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah, teachers are like, cause my grandfather was a principal.  He was a science teacher back in India but then became a principal.  He was like the big dog in our little village, very respected um you know and it's like even here like doctors are like, patients scream at doctors demanding things versus other countries I'm like okay you're just a @@@.

PATIENT R700
But no you have to realize though in some areas around here the doctors here aren't always.

DOCTOR R700
Right, I agree.

PATIENT R700
The highest level.

DOCTOR R700
Right agree.

PATIENT R700
I mean when that guy said what he said to me I wanted to just knock him out.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah.  I know.  @@@.

PATIENT R700
Which one?

DOCTOR R700
The @@@.

PATIENT R700
Yeah.

DOCTOR R700
I just wondered after a while.  Do you still take Ativan?

PATIENT R700
What's Ativan?

DOCTOR R700
The lorazepam?

PATIENT R700
Lorazepam is the one for anxiety.

DOCTOR R700
Do you still take that?

PATIENT R700
That was as the as needed one.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah.

PATIENT R700
You don't always need it but when you need it.

DOCTOR R700
I know.

PATIENT R700
You really need it.

DOCTOR R700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R700
For my anxiety attacks I have a difficulty breathing.

DOCTOR R700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R700
And it's like fractured eyesight.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
So.  They tell me it's kind of near, for a while they were testing me for um.

DOCTOR R700
That's okay.

PATIENT R700
So while they were testing me for, what's the one for low blood sugar, not hypoglycemia.

DOCTOR R700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R700
They were testing for that cause they thought that's what it was.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
And then they eventually they finally, we narrowed it down and found out what it was.

DOCTOR R700
Do you want to pick this up?  @@@ the @@@?

PATIENT R700
I'd really appreciate it.  I haven't had one in months.

DOCTOR R700
You have, you want to pick it up? You know it takes six weeks for this stuff to kick in right?

PATIENT R700
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR R700
To fully kick in.

PATIENT R700
Oh yeah.  But I need to get something working cause I've been going downhill for a while.

DOCTOR R700
Do you have aspirin and do you have Tylenol?

PATIENT R700
I do have some but they usually order that.  They send that to me cause they said they had to.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
I don't know why but I have bottles upon bottles of that stuff.

DOCTOR R700
So I'm not gonna order that then.  Let me fill this out.  Were you ever taken off of the gemfibrozil?

PATIENT R700
No.

DOCTOR R700
You were never taken off.  And you're taking 600 twice a day? 

PATIENT R700
Yes.  And then they had Niaspan something, that's the one with the aspirin.

DOCTOR R700
Okay that one I do not see any refills.  Do you want to pick up the gemfibrozil?

PATIENT R700
I have plenty of that, that can be mailed.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
I'm still trying to go through the last bottle.  But the only reason that I had the aspirin was because of the niacin.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
But that stuff made me, when you take it, you take the aspirin and then a half hour later you take the Niaspan and then if I don't fall asleep fast enough I start itching from head to toe.

DOCTOR R700
Really.

PATIENT R700
It's like the weirdest frickin feeling.

DOCTOR R700
Do you want to pick up the Ativan, the lorazepam?

PATIENT R700
I definitely need it so I have to have that @@@.

DOCTOR R700
So that you can pick up.  So that's all the medicine @@@.

PATIENT R700
You know what I think he was trying to get me off of that one I think because I told him I was itching so bad.

DOCTOR R700
So you don't want the @@@?

PATIENT R700
I don't really care for it one way or the other.  If I need it because my triglycerides are too high that's one thing but if I don't need it I would prefer not to have that itching sensatioin.

DOCTOR R700
How about we'll check your labs today, if they're too high then we'll go ahead and mail it.

PATIENT R700
Yeah.

DOCTOR R700
Okay, how does that sound?

PATIENT R700
The last time I was with DOCTOR he had me take a blood test and one of the things was some PFT I think he said it was.

DOCTOR R700
PSA?

PATIENT R700
Something about prostate.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah.

PATIENT R700
And what did they find out?

DOCTOR R700
It was normal back then.

PATIENT R700
I'm good.

DOCTOR R700
@@@.  You're too young to have anything going on with that.

PATIENT R700
You'd be surprised.

DOCTOR R700
You're too young.

PATIENT R700
I have a family history of that so I have to get a colonoscopy ear;u two.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah.  Okay.  We'll hold off on the @@@ okay.

PATIENT R700
I'd really appreciate that.

DOCTOR R700
So @@@ and the Ativan you can pick up today, the lorazepam I mean.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
And then the gemfibrozil will be mailed to you.  Um you had that familial hereditary polyposis.

PATIENT R700
Yeah polyposis yeah.

DOCTOR R700
Do you have it too?

PATIENT R700
Uh they said I was okay, I don't.

DOCTOR R700
They didn't find any?

PATIENT R700
I don't know what they found.  I don't always.  I don't always hear the results of what they do.  They said that.

DOCTOR R700
You are due for a colonoscopy in 2015.  Anytime between 2013 and 2015.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT R700
I'll be 43 that year.

DOCTOR R700
Anytime between the age of 43 to 45.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.  Because I won't be @@@.  Alright, well let me.

PATIENT R700
Did they even find anything with the test?

DOCTOR R700
Let me give you the niacin because if you haven't been on any of that stuff, I'd say you need it okay.  @@@.

PATIENT R700
I have no idea.  All I know is that, I think it was like 750 or something.  It was some huge amount.

DOCTOR R700
Probably.  @@@.  Okay we'll just do @@@.

PATIENT R700
They tell me it was at night, take it before I go to bed so it flushes my system or something.

DOCTOR R700
And you take one pill at nighttime okay.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
Um @@@.  

PATIENT R700
That'd be awesome.  Whoever that is talking, I know somebody that sounds just like her.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah.  @@@ people out there.

PATIENT R700
So when I leave here I go down to the uh Lab and have blood drawn?

DOCTOR R700
When you leave here yes.

PATIENT R700
And then get meds.

DOCTOR R700
Yes.

PATIENT R700
@@@.

DOCTOR R700
Do you drink at all?

PATIENT R700
Very rarely?

DOCTOR R700
Okay don't drink or drive when you're on the Ativan okay.

PATIENT R700
I know, I know.  I don't like losing control so I prefer not to take anything that affects my control or who I am.

DOCTOR R700
Good.

PATIENT R700
My students say I have a touch of OCD.

DOCTOR R700
Really?  @@@ with that.

PATIENT R700
@@@ being a teacher.

DOCTOR R700
@@@.

PATIENT R700
Try being a teacher.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah you have to be really organized you know.

PATIENT R700
My student teacher just found that out this year.  She's freaking out.

DOCTOR R700
What?

PATIENT R700
About the organization required to be a teacher.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah it's hard.  I don’t know how you do that.  Do you teach multiple levels?

PATIENT R700
Right now I'm only teaching one @@@.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
But that's actually even harder because you don't know um what you're going through.  Like they blend together you don't know if you've covered everything in every period.

DOCTOR R700
Right.  Um so I'll be right back.  Let me take a listen.  Deep breath in and out.  And again.  Deep breath, one more.  Let me see your ankles real quick.

PATIENT R700
I got like weird coloration on my ankles.  

DOCTOR R700
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R700
They call it combat boot scaring but.

DOCTOR R700
Alright I will be right back @@@.  You are absolutely not interested in following with Mental Health even if it's over the phone @@@ to talk to somebody?

PATIENT R700
It's so hard for me to go there.

DOCTOR R700
No, no, no, there's somebody that can talk to you over the phone so @@@ a psychiatrist.  So if there's any like, any issue that you ever want to talk to them for, I can like plug you in and they can maybe contact you.

PATIENT R700
That would be fine.

DOCTOR R700
It's @@@.

PATIENT R700
As long as it's not like.

DOCTOR R700
@@@.

PATIENT R700
I don't want the stigma that's the big thing.

DOCTOR R700
You don't even have to come in so it will be over the phone.  They'll call you @@@.  So that way you'll know what your options are.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
And what you could @@@.

PATIENT R700
I can handle that, it's just.

DOCTOR R700
That's fine.  It's very difficult.

PATIENT R700
Coming this far to.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah I know.

PATIENT R700
You know I live with a job, I teach and to come all the way over to @@@.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah.

PATIENT R700
Only to have somebody place a stigma on you.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah.

PATIENT R700
It's, it actually I think increases the stress.

DOCTOR R700
I want you to talk have someone to kind of contact even if it's just to cope with the.

PATIENT R700
That'd be awesome.

DOCTOR R700
Okay I'll be right back.

DOCTOR OUT:  28:12   DOCTOR IN:  35:06

DOCTOR R700
Okay.  So I talked to my attending.

PATIENT R700
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R700
And I talked to my attending, okay.  I just wanted to explain, I know you were highly against and that whole department.

PATIENT R700
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R700
Um the rules changed here because you don't actually have a diagnosis like depression or anxiety, it's what DOCTOR labeled you as right?

PATIENT R700
No that's what's there @@@ mental health. 

DOCTOR R700
Through here?

PATIENT R700
Yeah.

DOCTOR R700
A long time ago okay.  So it's something that we usually kind of have to abide by because can @@@ medications but we need like a pseudo or formal evaluation.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
So the rule is that either you have to follow a doctor, I think two or three times within a 90 day period and I'm only here once every five weeks basically, like I have clinic for five days then I'm off for four weeks and then a clinic for five days again okay.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
So it's like those or two or three phone calls that @@@ can call you about.

PATIENT R700
So, I have to talk to health.

DOCTOR R700
So you have to talk to them.

PATIENT R700
That's fine.  I don't, @@@ that's easy.

DOCTOR R700
And the only other thing is they, the only reason why honestly from our end that we want you to see them is you need the medication management.  Because they are well versed with monitoring for side effects and can titrate your medications appropriately.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
We know okay this medicine is for this but we don't know what these side effects are, we don't know how high should we go or how low should we go, when should we stop the medicine and all we are taught is depression you take Paxil, depression you take Elavil or whatever meds that are out there okay.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
So that's why.  It's not so much that.

PATIENT R700
Well the reason that they did it is I was on Paxil before and that's the only reason that he was able to do that.

DOCTOR R700
That's fine.  That's fine, that's okay but the rules have changed like I told you so that's the only reason why.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
It's not.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
And if you don't want us to get @@@.

PATIENT R700
I don't have a problem talking to them on the phone.

DOCTOR R700
No, no, no.  I think he wants to meet you.  You don't even have to meet him at the Mental Health.  You could meet him here.

PATIENT R700
Okay.

DOCTOR R700
That's fine.

PATIENT R700
That I can do.

DOCTOR R700
Okay.

PATIENT R700
It's just, like I said it's just the stigma.

DOCTOR R700
So like we're, I think his office is actually upstairs so I don't know about it.  Like if you really just would be meeting somebody, like really have a strong aversion to like going to that building but I don't mind meeting you in the main hospital somewhere in one of the clinics on the third floor.  I would tell him that.

PATIENT R700
And it's just, and it's just I don't have a problem talking to him @@@I’ve done that.

DOCTOR R700
I know.

PATIENT R700
I just don't like that stigma.

DOCTOR R700
That's no problem, it’s okay.

PATIENT R700
It just keeps me from getting in trouble.

DOCTOR R700
That's okay.  So one more thing that you're due for today is a vaccine called.

PATIENT R700
Which vaccine?

DOCTOR R700
Called TDAP.  Tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis.

PATIENT R700
Really.

DOCTOR R700
Yeah.  So you only have to take it once, that's it.  This is a one time you have to take it.  You already had it as a kid and you have to take it as an adult one time.

PATIENT R700

DOCTOR R700

PATIENT R700
Okay.  That's fine, yeah okay.

DOCTOR R700

DOCTOR R700
