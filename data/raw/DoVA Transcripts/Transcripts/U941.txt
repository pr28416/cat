DOCTOR U941
That will help.  That will definitely help.

PATIENT U941
Cause I was 230.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah now it's at 225.

PATIENT U941
I don't know @@@.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah standing but you @@@ in June I don't know is this right, in June of 2000 well you were 172.

PATIENT U941
When I came here, I came here in June.

DOCTOR U941
Cause you were working.

PATIENT U941
No I wasn't.  I came here from Puerto Rico cause I was dying and they sent me for treatment.

DOCTOR U941
Here from alcohol.

PATIENT U941
Alcohol.

DOCTOR U941
Is that why your weight was so low cause you weren't eating?

PATIENT U941
Oh it was no.  I drink and I did not eat nothing for weeks.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah look at how much your weight went up.  Your weight went up from you were 172 and then you went up to 215 and then you kind of were stable so hopefully when you start working again your weight will come down.

PATIENT U941
Cause I need to work over there @@@.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah.

PATIENT U941
There are 25 acres.

DOCTOR U941
Well that's fantastic so I'm very happy that.  So how long can you stay in Cook Manor for?

PATIENT U941
Two years.

DOCTOR U941
Oh great so you have some time to get some money built up, get an apartment, two years.  Do you mind if I take a look at you?

PATIENT U941
Okay.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah let me take a peak.  I'm gonna wash my hands.  

PATIENT U941
Now I want to see, I don't know if it was you or the other doctor.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah.

PATIENT U941
Cause I have, my feet were sweating big time.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT U941
And he said that was cause I was taking the high blood pressure pills and he gave me some water pills and they helped.

DOCTOR U941
I don't know how are your feet?

PATIENT U941
I take a the pills and I continue to @@@.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah.

PATIENT U941
And to be honest with you, he gave me like a 25 mg pill to have me take half pills.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah, right.

PATIENT U941
I've been taking the whole pill.

DOCTOR U941
Okay fine.

PATIENT U941
Because it is so tiny.

DOCTOR U941
Well your blood pressure, it's not for your blood pressure control.  Your blood pressure's good.

PATIENT U941
Well the only thing that I am always concerned, being my concern is besides the high blood pressure is the heart @@@.

DOCTOR U941
Oh yeah.

PATIENT U941
I know, when I came to the states.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah.

PATIENT U941
I used to have 120, 145.

DOCTOR U941
So that can be due to the alcohol.  People that have alcohol they can go into withdrawals or when they're drinking can get heart rates that are fast and I know that you were drinking and not drinking and your body was probably.  Did you used to get the shakes a lot?

PATIENT U941
I know, it's gone.

DOCTOR U941
Okay.

PATIENT U941
But when you see me, when I came here uh.

DOCTOR U941
You were clean when I saw you in November.

PATIENT U941
I was.

DOCTOR U941
Yeah you told me.

PATIENT U941
I was clean from drugs.

DOCTOR U941
You told me you would drink a little bit in Puerto Rico, that's why you left.

PATIENT U941
Uh that was bullshit, I was drinking lots.

DOCTOR U941
Oh I knew.  Don't worry, @@@ its okay.  Keep breathing.

PATIENT U941
As a matter of fact when you see me in the last time in November I was stop drinking for one day and I was shaking, my hand was shaking cause I was.

DOCTOR U941
Well I was trying to figure out why you left Puerto Rico, you came all the way up here just to see me, I didn't think I was that important so I was trying to figure out why you came here and left your family and I know you say that you can get a better job here so I think that that's fantastic but I know also you said that.  You go to the bathroom okay?  Well you told me that if you stayed around Puerto Rico you'd get in trouble.  You know you told me you were hanging out with the wrong guys and that.  

PATIENT U941
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR U941
Your legs look good, they look real good.  There's no swelling at all.  Um so I think you're doing fantastic.  I'm very glad that uh you were able to get a job and you were able to get somewhere to live.  I applaud you for stopping alcohol and drugs.  I think that whatever you have to do to stay away from it do it.  I think that your health will get better as you start working more.  You will feel more motivated.  You'll have a real reason to get up in the morning and after a while you'll feel more empowered and you'll have more money and you can get an apartment and then you know hopefully you can get back with your family and get everything the way you want it again.

PATIENT U941
Yeah.  I'm applying for some job here in the hospital.

DOCTOR U941
Good.  Apply for everything you know we can do for you.

PATIENT U941
Yeah I get that job for @@@ you know.

DOCTOR U941
Hey anything, any extra money is helpful.  It'll help you get back on your feet and help you get out of here.  And just keep the colonoscopy appointment.  Uh I don't think we're gonna change any medications today and it looks like you have DOCTOR in May, early May he's gonna see you.  So let me go, I'll talk to my boss but I like the way everything's going.  I'm going to see you in the summer.

PATIENT U941
