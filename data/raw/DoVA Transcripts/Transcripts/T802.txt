Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR T802
PATIENT?  I'm DOCTOR, nice to meet you.

PATIENT T802
Hi DOCTOR, nice to meet you.

DOCTOR T802
You’ve seen a couple of my other colleagues over the last couple of months.

PATIENT T802
Oh.

DOCTOR T802
So @@@.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.

DOCTOR T802
Okay have a seat.

PATIENT T802
Alright thank you.

DOCTOR T802
How are you doing?

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Is this room too cold for you? A little.

PATIENT T802
No it's alright.

DOCTOR T802
If it’s getting cool, let me know.

PATIENT T802
Okay, alright.  Oh it's really cool outside now.

DOCTOR T802
Yeah exactly.  So um what can I do for you today?

PATIENT T802
Okay uh a couple things.  I had a VA pamphlet that I was reading over about ear wax.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
I wanted to have that checked cause I have noticeable hearing loss in my right ear and it runs in the family so that might be hereditary.  But also I have the tinnitus in my left ear that comes and goes.

DOCTOR T802
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T802
So I use hearing protection at my job but I still, you know I get, sometimes it's really bad and it lasts for several days.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Right now it's real slight, I can barely tell.  

DOCTOR T802
Anything else going on?  Just routine stuff?

PATIENT T802
Yeah routine and still I don't know if it mentions the sleep test I had in there but I still seem to be up and down.

DOCTOR T802
Oh that's right.

PATIENT T802
A while back yeah.

DOCTOR T802
Well, um I think we need to do a titration study this time cause you did it once before and they said to sleep on your side, do you remember?

PATIENT T802
Right.

DOCTOR T802
Did you try that?

PATIENT T802
Yeah well that's what I mostly do uh, especially with the acid reflux but occasionally I'll roll over on my back in the middle of the night and I'll wake up gasping and uh.  I've also noticed at times I have chalky taste in my mouth and my jaw hurts and my dentist says I'm grinding away my enamel hurting my teeth a lot.

DOCTOR T802
Oh and that happens with people with sleep apnea actually.

PATIENT T802
Oh okay.

DOCTOR T802
We can get that checked out.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.

DOCTOR T802
Um let me see what your blood tests showed today also.  I can order that again for you.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Now the blood pressure looks okay I mean it's not terrible.

PATIENT T802
Yeah I haven't had that.  Every once in a while I'll get a shortness of breath thing going on but I think that's sometimes the acid reflux.

DOCTOR T802
It could be and it could be that its sleep apnea issues also.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Um what do you mean you get this shortness of breath thing?

PATIENT T802
Oh every once in a while I just uh.  I mean I work out fairly regularly.

DOCTOR T802
Yeah. Come in. (Doctor speaks with someone who came to the door)  I'll be right back.

PATIENT T802
Yeah sure, no problem.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:30  DOCTOR IN:  36:14)

Knock on door.

PATIENT T802
Yep.

DOCTOR T802
Okay, alright.  Okay so you work out and then you occasionally get short of breath when you're done?

PATIENT T802
Yeah well not from my workouts, it's weird.  It comes and goes.  I may be doing a job or maybe just around the house or something.

DOCTOR T802
So you're usually doing an activity when it happens.

PATIENT T802
Well yeah right.  I've never had anything hit me like when I'm working out.  I mean there's days when I'm so exhausted I just skip my workout.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Which is uh, it's kind of a cardio and some light weights type of a workout.

DOCTOR T802
Well we can um, have you ever had an echocardiogram?  An ultrasound of the heart?

PATIENT T802
Um no.

DOCTOR T802
That's something we can look at.  ‘Cuz sometimes people with sleep apnea have very high blood pressure on one side of the heart.

PATIENT T802
Oh.

DOCTOR T802
So, very high blood pressure on one side of the heart meaning the side that goes into the lungs because you can get what's called pulmonary hypertension so you can have normal blood pressures systemically like when we do the cuff.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
But when it runs through your lungs there's high pressure and when that's the case you can get problems uh even sudden cardiac death.

PATIENT T802
Oh yikes.

DOCTOR T802
So we can, I don't think that's what's happening.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Probably not but I just want to be safe and check that since you do have some sleep apnea um.  It looks like there is an element of sleep apnea I think but maybe it isn’t necessarily just positional so.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
We'll order the echo I think and then we'll order another sleep study it's what they previously recommended.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
So that they can titrate you, meaning they can see what level of the mask works for you.

PATIENT T802
Okay great.

DOCTOR T802
And I know that was a terrible study for you last time cause I noted that the notes said it was worse than your usual sleep.

PATIENT T802
It was really cold in the room for one thing and uh I took two sleeping pill, over-the-counter.

DOCTOR T802
Yeah.

PATIENT T802
So 50 mg Toradol and I just couldn't get drowsy till late.

DOCTOR T802
Yeah.

PATIENT T802
You know and then one time I guess I fell asleep on my back and they screamed over the thing to wake up and roll on my side.

DOCTOR T802
Oh my goodness.

PATIENT T802
And like if something was going on and I go from like my sofa to my bed and with the sofa it forces me to lay on one side.

DOCTOR T802
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T802
But then you know I get up cause my shoulder's sore and.

DOCTOR T802
Well then maybe having the CPAP mask is the way to go.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
So we'll check that out again.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Yeah that'd great because being tired you know, the memory and you know the concentration problem.

DOCTOR T802
Exactly.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.

DOCTOR T802
Now are you having any um more outbreaks of the rash now and then?

PATIENT T802
Uh I had one; I just got over one about a week ago.  That's because my prescription ran out.  I phoned in for a renewal and it said well they have to check so and so.  So I figured they would check it and would automatically send me and then nothing came and I like called uh and reordered and now I've been on it for a couple days.

DOCTOR T802
We're gonna get you assigned to me I think so.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
That you have a regular doctor instead of you know this person and that person so that way um you won't get things lost like that again.

PATIENT T802
Okay great.  That'd be great.

DOCTOR T802
And then I'll just follow up with all your sleep studies and all your imaging exams and everything um and your cholesterol and all that okay.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Um and I'll be around for about one more year.

PATIENT T802
Alright.

DOCTOR T802
And we're gonna have to look for.

PATIENT T802
Oh brother.

DOCTOR T802
Yeah.

PATIENT T802
Oh you're like the fourth.

DOCTOR T802
I know.

PATIENT T802
Why do I have all those doctors so far so I think.

DOCTOR T802
Well good I might be here then.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.

DOCTOR T802
No smoking, no alcohol?

PATIENT T802
Never smoked.  Rarely drink; my drinking is very rare because of the reflux too.  It's like drinking acid for me.

DOCTOR T802
How about blood in the stool, nothing like that?  Oh and you had a colonoscopy which was perfect.

PATIENT T802
Which was perfect yeah.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.  The only blood in the stool, I mean not in the stool, just the hemorrhoids you know, the only blood I see there but yeah, no black stool or any of that.

DOCTOR T802
Yeah good.  Okay so let's examine you here.  This cold is kind of grossing me out.  So what are the Awnings Unlimited?

PATIENT T802
That's my company business.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
It's my dad and I.

DOCTOR T802
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T802
Another guy and I and mom of course does the books and we uh manufacture and install custom made aluminum awnings.

DOCTOR T802
Really, very nice.

PATIENT T802
Patio covers.

DOCTOR T802
You manufacture it?

PATIENT T802
Yeah, we measure and manufacture everything ourselves.

DOCTOR T802
That's excellent.  How long?

PATIENT T802
Well when I started after I left the service 25 years ago it was a good business but now with the economy.

DOCTOR T802
Right.

PATIENT T802
So there's more stress because things.

DOCTOR T802
I understand.

PATIENT T802
Yeah, so far this year it's not looking too bad.

DOCTOR T802
Very good.

PATIENT T802
You need the shirt up or?

DOCTOR T802
Oh no, no.

PATIENT T802
Okay cool.

DOCTOR T802
Deep breath.  Sounds good.  Go ahead and sit back.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
No stomach pain with your acid reflux ever?

PATIENT T802
Uh occasionally, I had a little bit today drinking a Sprite.

DOCTOR T802
You did.

PATIENT T802
Yeah I got a little.

DOCTOR T802
I'll have you lean back.  How often does that bother you?

PATIENT T802
Um.

DOCTOR T802
Your reflux symptoms.  The pains are here usually or no?

PATIENT T802
It, sometimes I'll have them down in the, down in here.

DOCTOR T802
Oh.

PATIENT T802
That I can feel it.

DOCTOR T802
Coming up?

PATIENT T802
Yeah especially if I bend over which I try to avoid.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
I notice I have to eat a lot less than I used to.

DOCTOR T802
Have you ever been scoped from the top before?

PATIENT T802
Yeah before I started coming to the VA.

DOCTOR T802
You have.

PATIENT T802
Yeah back when we had health insurance at work I had.

DOCTOR T802
That may be another thing we can consider.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
I know I'm trying a lot of tests.

PATIENT T802
That's uh, it was at Good Samaritan Hospital, DOCTOR there and he went with a scope and that's when I found out that I had a hiatal hernia.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Yeah the flap doesn't close.

DOCTOR T802
What year was that do you remember?

PATIENT T802
Oh man, that's got to be, let's see before 9/11 I'm thinking cause I.

DOCTOR T802
Wow that's quite some time.

PATIENT T802
It's been some time.  I'm thinking, you know I'll find out for sure.  I can look up my records.  Maybe it wasn't that long ago.  My memory's terrible for that sort of thing um but it was about a year before I started coming to the VA so, which I think I started around 9/11, I mean 01 or 02.

DOCTOR T802
And that's happening several times a day or several times a week the symptoms?

PATIENT T802
I'd say more several times a week.  Yeah I don't get it every day.

DOCTOR T802
And you're taking the omeprazole 40 once daily?

PATIENT T802
I'm taking it once in the morning and once in the evening.

DOCTOR T802
Oh twice a day.

PATIENT T802
Twice a day whatever the standard capsule I think it was yeah.  And occasionally when its bad at night, I try not to eat late but sometimes I do and then I use a chewable like an over-the-counter like a Pepto Bismol chewable sort of a.

DOCTOR T802
I think it might be time to get the scope done okay.

PATIENT T802
Alright.

DOCTOR T802
Um but we can, so there's like three tests that I kind of want to do for you.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
I'll make sure things are okay.  In addition to your routine blood work and stuff.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Um now you need to get your cholesterol checked again and diabetes screened um.  Well that was back in September, I don't think we need to do that.

PATIENT T802
Right away.  Yeah they were doing it, yeah when I first started on the cholesterol drug cause I was getting it every six months or less at this point now.

DOCTOR T802
Yeah maybe we should check again.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Next spring sometime.

PATIENT T802
Alright.

DOCTOR T802
So then you have to be fasting though.

PATIENT T802
That's okay; I've done that every time.

DOCTOR T802
Do you live far away though?  Where's Crest Hill?

PATIENT T802
It's uh, its right by Joliet.  Well from here it's about 35 miles.

DOCTOR T802
@@@ ideally I'd like you to come back to get these done fasting.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Um.

PATIENT T802
I can do it.  The nice thing about being a family business is it's really flexible about that.  Which is why I come to Hines cause our business is in Brookfield.

DOCTOR T802
Oh, okay.

PATIENT T802
So I'm not going to Joliet Clinic.

DOCTOR T802
Oh okay, well okay.

PATIENT T802
Cause it's always easier for me here.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Um.

DOCTOR T802
I wondered about that.

PATIENT T802
Yeah and they ask that every time.

DOCTOR T802
So they thought there's something in Joliet.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.

DOCTOR T802
Well why don't we um, we maybe can try and coordinate it with when you have one of these other tests so that you're not coming here too frequently.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
But the orders will be in the computer and then.

PATIENT T802
Okay sure that'd be fine yeah.  The fasting like I said is not a problem, I've done that you know every time.

DOCTOR T802
And then once I get those lab tests back then I can maybe order you the gastroenterologists here to take a look from up top.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
To see what's going on okay.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT T802
Sure.

DOCTOR T802
Any questions?

PATIENT T802
Uh no, so far it sounds good other than you could take a look in my ears just.

DOCTOR T802
Absolutely that's why you came in here.  Why don't you have a seat?

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Take @@@.  It's not unusual.

PATIENT T802
To record.  Yeah basically I hadn't read that, I just assumed it was hereditary and aging but I want to run that by you.

DOCTOR T802
But you're too young for that @@@.

PATIENT T802
Alright cause I know my dad, before he passed away, he had two hearing aids and he came here all the time.

DOCTOR T802
It looks very clear on the left side.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
So here's what I'm gonna do actually, probably have you see, yeah there's zero wax in there.

PATIENT T802
Oh okay great.

DOCTOR T802
We'll have that cleaned.

PATIENT T802
Then I know what it is.  I know, I know.

DOCTOR T802
Well, do you want to evaluate it further though by one of the doctors here or?

PATIENT T802
Well what do you?

DOCTOR T802
The ENT doctors or audiologists here, they do the hearing aids.

PATIENT T802
Oh okay, well I don't think I'm bad enough where I need a hearing aid yet, you know where I mean kind of a prescription one.  I just have if it's a noisy environment, like in a restaurant I can't hear somebody too well if they talk to my right ear.

DOCTOR T802
Especially a high voice then.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.

DOCTOR T802
If it's usually high voices then you have a high pitch?

PATIENT T802
No I don't hear the low.

DOCTOR T802
You don’t hear low voices okay.

PATIENT T802
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Or the soft, like I have a favorite restaurant and I have a favorite waitress and she's really quiet and she always come to my right side and I've always got to you know turn my head.

DOCTOR T802
Well maybe um, well it's an option if you'd like to be evaluated by the audiologist or your doctors.

PATIENT T802
Yeah I don't know.

DOCTOR T802
Think about it, give us a call, call in.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
And if you want the referral then we can do it for you okay.

PATIENT T802
Okay yeah let's try it that way.  As long as I know it's not a buildup.

DOCTOR T802
No there is nothing in there.

PATIENT T802
Cause I know those Q-Tips.

DOCTOR T802
Don't use Q-Tips, they cause infections and can impact all the wax in there.

PATIENT T802
That's what I was worried about.

DOCTOR T802
I'll be right back then.

PATIENT T802
Okay sure.

(DOCTOR OUT:  48:28  DOCTOR IN:  59:44)

DOCTOR T802
Okay, so I was talking to the other doctors here.

PATIENT T802
Sure.

DOCTOR T802
And he thinks that we should just have you see the ear doctors just the same.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
You can make an appointment like for two months down the road though cause they're usually real full anyway.

PATIENT T802
Sure.

DOCTOR T802
That way we just have it in already.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
But we probably should get the scope again.

PATIENT T802
Alright.

DOCTOR T802
And the sleep test again and then instead of an echo, you know the ultrasound.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.

DOCTOR T802
Do a stress test to look at things.

PATIENT T802
Okay.  That's where I got to run on the machine or something?

DOCTOR T802
Yeah.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.

DOCTOR T802
Well you exert yourself.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
More at work or it depends.  For some people they can exert themselves more at work.

PATIENT T802
Probably at work because it's more constant.  I don't go to the gym, I work out at home.

DOCTOR T802
Oh okay.

PATIENT T802
Uh I have a mat and free weights and uh, I basically follow Fit TV, I don't know if you've ever heard of Total Body Scope where they go on, it's a program that's on.  It's a 30 minute.

DOCTOR T802
I think I've heard of it.

PATIENT T802
Yeah well I do that.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Pretty much every day and then work is physical.  I'm on my feet most of the day or up and down ladders.

DOCTOR T802
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T802
Lifting, drilling brick or whatever so uh yeah.

DOCTOR T802
So it's pretty physical then.

PATIENT T802
It's pretty physical yeah right.  That's probably what keeps me from being fat.

DOCTOR T802
That's good.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.

DOCTOR T802
We'll keep it that way.

PATIENT T802
Yeah cause I don't always eat right at work.  I know I don't eat enough fiber.  I take Fiber Choice tablets to kind of make up for it but you know.

DOCTOR T802
So here's what we're gonna do um, so in order to get the scope ordered, the EGD to take a look at the heartburn issues, you have to get labs done for that.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
But if you're gonna get labs done for that, you might as well.

PATIENT T802
Cholesterol and everything else.

DOCTOR T802
Exactly.  So let's set it up that you come back maybe sometime next week.

PATIENT T802
Sounds fine.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Any time.

DOCTOR T802
Yeah and you literally can come back any time as long as you've had nothing to eat after midnight.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Or prior.

PATIENT T802
So it's like 14 hours, something like that.

DOCTOR T802
Exactly right.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
That's what it is.

PATIENT T802
Okay, I'm usually at like 16 hours by the time I get in there.

DOCTOR T802
Oh that's plenty, plenty.

PATIENT T802
Yeah okay.  Then I go get a nice greasy cheeseburger, fries, no.

DOCTOR T802
Well.

PATIENT T802
Actually I eat like that a lot, I try to avoid it but, you know how it is.  You're on the job and you're running, can't always stop for something healthy.  Talk about stress too, when you hear about how they cut all us category 7 and 8 veterans out of the health care system.

DOCTOR T802
Oh really.

PATIENT T802
Yeah that's what.

DOCTOR T802
Oh my goodness.

PATIENT T802
The Tea Partier's have been talking about cutting funding and I just go man, that'll be it for my statin drugs and everything else.

DOCTOR T802
Oh my goodness.

PATIENT T802
Yeah.  That's more than I can afford on my own.  But the veteran groups are fighting it so we'll see.

(Knock on the door.  Doctor speaks to person at the door.)

DOCTOR T802
Okay, I want to make sure I have everything ordered.

PATIENT T802
Okay.  And my meds are all renewed for another year now too, cool.

DOCTOR T802
PHONE NUMBER?

PATIENT T802
PHONE NUMBER.

DOCTOR T802
PHONE NUMBER.

PATIENT T802
Yeah, that's my home phone.  You should have my cell in there as well.

DOCTOR T802
Would you rather have the cell phone here?

PATIENT T802
Um yeah you know.

DOCTOR T802
Cause which ever you want.

PATIENT T802
PHONE NUMBER.

DOCTOR T802
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T802
PHONE NUMBER.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.  PHONE NUMBER.

PATIENT T802
Correct.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Yeah cause I might get rid of my home line so, the cell is probably better.  I've always got that with me.  

DOCTOR T802
Okay, you're all set.  So fasting labs in one week, Audiology or ENT that's the ear stuff, about eight weeks, stress test as soon as you can.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
CPAP titration, the sleep test as soon as you can.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
And then we'll get the EGD, a scope after all the labs have been done.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
Okay.

PATIENT T802
Alright.

DOCTOR T802
Alright.

PATIENT T802
Okay.

DOCTOR T802
