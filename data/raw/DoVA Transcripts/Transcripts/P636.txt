Okay, so it's just your regularly scheduled check-up?

PATIENT P636
I guess.  You know cause the last time I came the nurse said I asked when should I come back and she said well I don't see anything here, if we need you we'll call you and let you know.  Anyway. 

DOCTOR P636
But if they just kind of get a letter we just set up a time.

PATIENT P636
Hmm, probably cause that they did they sent me a letter like a week before.  They send me a letter saying that I missed the appointment and I never had the appointment.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
And then a week later, like just about a week later, they send me another letter and I open it up and I had this appointment.  So I'm here.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
So I don't have to call in.  It kind of comes with taking a couple @@@.  

DOCTOR P636

Sometimes, sometimes you know.  Yeah I fell asleep, just about two days ago, I fell asleep with the TV on and I don't know why, but you know I could, it seemed like I was having a bad dream and I woke up and you know I had tears in my eyes and what I was dreaming what was on the TV.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
And it was like and it was what happened with a Mel Gibson movie.  We Were Soldiers that was playing and then it was like sad and I just shut it off and insomnia, you know I stayed up for a while and then I went to sleep.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
But it was hard.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.  Um and you're not thinking at all of like harming yourself or any others.

PATIENT P636
No, no, no.

DOCTOR P636
Would you say that the PTSD is uh not controlled, somewhat controlled or well controlled?

PATIENT P636
Well, it's, how would I say, it's controlled I guess.  But then again there's days where you know you just, whenever you see something or you know, something happened and it just clicks and something clicks and you know you just, you maybe not at home and it just happens and stuff that happened so I just have to deal with it and you know, just deal with it.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
And uh try to get home.  I'm fine in my home you know, @@@ I'm at home but sometimes, I don't know some other guys carry on and sometimes it's okay and then I know when I got to leave and then I just go.

DOCTOR P636
So this is my card.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
The number on the back there is the number for the Mental Health Center if you were ever to need anything quickly.

PATIENT P636
Oh okay.

DOCTOR P636
Um so what you do is you call into the normal VA number like you know the Vets Number.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
I think its 1-800.

PATIENT P636
I have the card at home; I think I have it at home so.

DOCTOR P636
So if you dialed that, then when they ask you for an extension, you can dial that extension.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
Let me uh, I got to take this for a second.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
Did you eat anything today?

PATIENT P636
Um.

DOCTOR P636
If you ate.

PATIENT P636
Just coffee cake today you know.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
I just had it with my coffee this morning, that's it.

DOCTOR P636
Whenever we ask you to get a cholesterol panel, we need you to be 14 hours fasting.

PATIENT P636
Oh okay.

DOCTOR P636
I think I'll go ahead and order a cholesterol panel for you.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
And um next time you're at the VA for some reason, just get it drawn you know.

PATIENT P636
You mean a blood sample?

DOCTOR P636
Yeah a blood draw.

PATIENT P636
Oh go downstairs.

DOCTOR P636
You have to be fasting for 14 hours.  Which just means like after you finish dinner at night.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
Don't eat anything else.

PATIENT P636
Don't eat anything else.

DOCTOR P636
And then you come in the morning, get your blood drawn and then you can eat breakfast.

PATIENT P636
Okay.  Uh I can do that next week sometime.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.  That'd be great.  Just because you know.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
Um once you hit like 40-50 we like to start checking cholesterol and the urine and seeing whether or not we need to talk about diet changes or starting medication or something like that.

PATIENT P636
Alright.

DOCTOR P636
Uh blood pressure looks good and so I'll just restart the Lamisil and I'll have you follow up with the Mental Health people.

PATIENT P636
And for my blood pressure, hydro what are they?

DOCTOR P636
Yeah I'll reorder those.  And those are, you have refills of them.

PATIENT P636
Right so I just need to take a look at them, to tell you the truth actually.

DOCTOR P636
Okay well you have refills so.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
You can go downstairs to the Pharmacy and go tell them that you'd like your refills; you'd like to get refills.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
Or you can call in.  It'd probably be best, you know if you're running out.

PATIENT P636
Can I just call them, this way if I come in next week, like say Tuesday or something like that I could pick them up?

DOCTOR P636
Well they mail them to your house.

PATIENT P636
Okay can I call and just pick them up because sometimes it takes a week, two weeks.

DOCTOR P636
I don't think you can call in and pick them up from here.

PATIENT P636
Oh no, oh okay.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
So I'll just have to call in and have them mail it.

DOCTOR P636
Yeah.  I'll see whether or not I can call down to the Pharmacy.  I've got to go talk to my attending.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
To see if I can call down to the Pharmacy and get that set up to be picked up before you leave.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
Take a deep breath.  Okay.  Let me take a quick listen to your lungs.  Okay.  If I can just get you to lay back down.  @@@.  Okay, sit up.  I was reading one of the notes, you drink about 4-5 beers per day?

PATIENT P636
Yeah.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
@@@ but just about every day.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.  Um and you know you can talk to the Mental Health people about that but I mean a little bit more alcohol than you know we like to be comfortable with.  You know that being said um, if you're drinking that much, you know I don't think that's to the level of alcoholism but it is to the level that is you know somewhat concerning and I guess my biggest concern is that you're on the Lamisil.  Lamisil can already cause problems with your liver.

PATIENT P636
Oh is that right?

DOCTOR P636
Yeah so um the alcohol would just kind of be more of an insult that are causing problems there.

PATIENT P636
Oh.  Okay.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
So I mean try to keep it on the, you know the lighter side.

PATIENT P636
Yeah alright.  Okay.

DOCTOR P636
Uh like I mean, just this is double check, you are drinking.

PATIENT P636
That's one of the reasons I go to the post you know.

DOCTOR P636
You're going to go where?

PATIENT P636
American Legion Post.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
A number of vets there and.

DOCTOR P636
And everyone drinks there.

PATIENT P636
Yeah you know.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
Watching the games, things like that.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.  Um, how often would you say you drink to the point of um like intoxication, being drunk?

PATIENT P636
Well, really as far as to intoxication it's for more like uh only when like holidays.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
Not really even holidays.  Uh once in a while I mean there's nothing, I don't know how often.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
Once in a while.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.  I just wanted to make sure that you know with your diagnosis of PTSD.

PATIENT P636
Right.

DOCTOR P636
Um you're at a little bit higher risk for um getting into some stronger alcohol problems.

PATIENT P636
Right.

DOCTOR P636
Um so it's just a concern.

PATIENT P636
Yeah.

DOCTOR P636
I just want to make sure you're not like medicating yourself with alcohol for the PTSD.

PATIENT P636
No, no.  She won't let me.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.  Your wife or?

PATIENT P636
No girlfriend yeah.

DOCTOR P636
Girlfriend okay, good.  It's like men live longer when they have wives or girlfriends.

PATIENT P636
She like.

DOCTOR P636
Women live shorter so I always tell my girlfriend that men suck the life out of women.

PATIENT P636
Oh man she just comes, whenever she feels like it.  She has her own place like kind of whenever she comes in, and out and like yeah I'm just keeping an eye on you and I said alright, I know.

DOCTOR P636

DOCTOR P636
Okay.  Can I take a look at your nails?  So this stuff is growing in here, is like new nail.

PATIENT P636

PATIENT P636

DOCTOR P636

PATIENT P636

DOCTOR P636

PATIENT P636
Alright.

DOCTOR P636
If you do if it comes back we can treat it again.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
Uh but let's just see cause like I said you know it's not a totally benign drug.

PATIENT P636
Right.

DOCTOR P636
It can cause liver problems.

PATIENT P636
Oh okay.

DOCTOR P636
It's just @@@.

PATIENT P636
Alright, okay, thanks.

DOCTOR P636
As far as the trazodone, how many pills are you taking per day?

PATIENT P636
Uh oh it depends you know.  Sometimes I have to take three of them.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
Cause you now I.

DOCTOR P636
Three full pills or three half pills?

PATIENT P636
Three full pills.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.  You're only supposed to be taking one per day.

PATIENT P636
Once doesn't do anything.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
It doesn't and, it doesn't do anything sometimes.  I have to take like two of them sometimes.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
And then.

DOCTOR P636
It's as if they don't get you to the level where you're able to go to sleep?

PATIENT P636
No, I can't.  I still, I'll go to sleep, I mean I won't.  I don't want to go to sleep.

DOCTOR P636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P636
And it's not like I can't go to sleep.  You know before I used to take it and just go to sleep.

DOCTOR P636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P636
I guess I have to like make myself go to sleep and then I can't go to sleep.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
Just I don't know, it's not working.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
That's why I just take two, three, whatever I need at the time is what I take.

DOCTOR P636
Yeah.  Let me go talk to DOCTOR one more time.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
See what he wants to do about that.

(DOCTOR OUT:  81:30  DOCTOR IN:  83:18)

DOCTOR P636
So the maximum dose for those is 400 mg per day.

PATIENT P636
Per day.

DOCTOR P636
Per day.  I'll put in an order for you to get.

PATIENT P636
Cause I know uh, what was I using?  I used to take when I was in North Chicago or even over there at West Side I was getting I think it was 200 mg per, I think it was 200 or 250, I'd take two pills.

DOCTOR P636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P636
And they were I think like 100 a piece or something like that, I forgot what they were it's been a while.

DOCTOR P636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P636
But that's what I was getting when I was started at West Side or now at Jesse Brown but anyway um then when I went to Great Lakes, North Chicago there I was still taking those cause that's what they told me to take and I was taking them there.  That's it.

DOCTOR P636
So I think itâ€™s okay for you to take two or three per day and I.

PATIENT P636
See I don't take it every day, every day.

DOCTOR P636
Okay.

PATIENT P636
Only when I really need it cause I know they're not habit-forming or anything but I just you know.

DOCTOR P636
And also I want you to stop napping during the day.

PATIENT P636
How'd you guess?

DOCTOR P636
Cause everyone your age naps during the day.  So that's a problem is you'll be napping during the day and then you get like half of your sleep in and then you try your hardest to get to sleep at night and it's frustrating and eventually you fall asleep and then three hours later you wake up again.

PATIENT P636
Right.

DOCTOR P636
And you wake up again because you slept three hours earlier in the day and so now you've gotten your six hours for the day so your body's like we're done sleeping and you're like it's only 3 in the morning I need to go back to sleep.

PATIENT P636
I know and that helps watching TV.

DOCTOR P636
Instead set a pot of coffee out for maybe a few days.

PATIENT P636
I do.

DOCTOR P636
And drink that during the day and keep yourself up but the main thing is staying active so, you know.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
For at least a while try to find somewhere to go and go take a walk.  I know it's hot out but you know or go to the store and go to like Home Depot and walk around for a while.

PATIENT P636
@@@.

DOCTOR P636
Yeah and find you know something, a hobby to do.

PATIENT P636
What?

DOCTOR P636
Something to keep you awake during the day.

PATIENT P636
Really what I do.

DOCTOR P636
You get your schedule kind of flipped if you stop napping during the day and you stay awake at night, then that'll help.

PATIENT P636
Right.

DOCTOR P636
Also another problem that people have is that they drink a ton of coffee in the morning and they're wide awake and they're rearing to go and then 2 o'clock and crash.

PATIENT P636
Right.

DOCTOR P636
So what you got to do is drink less coffee in the morning and maybe have another little bit of coffee in the afternoon.

PATIENT P636
Okay.  They serve coffee at the Post.  A lot of times, weâ€™ll see.

DOCTOR P636
You spend a lot of time at the Post.

PATIENT P636
Well you know what, I what I do there I uh I clean up.

DOCTOR P636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P636
Keep me busy, keeps me doing something you know.

DOCTOR P636
Sure.

PATIENT P636
So I clean up, I load the beer. Do odds and ends there and there are two of us.

DOCTOR P636
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P636
And this is what we do every day.

DOCTOR P636
So yeah, it's.

PATIENT P636
Then I go home.

DOCTOR P636
And you fall asleep?

PATIENT P636
No, well yeah and then I go home and go to sleep.  You know I'm watching and I doze off and I don't even know what's going on you know I just wake up, I don't even know what time it is.  Holy shit I fell asleep for two hours and I don't believe this.

DOCTOR P636
Yeah.

PATIENT P636
And I might be sitting there watching TV and I don't know, I just fall asleep.  Girlfriend she's there watching TV, she's on the couch and I'm like on the loveseat there and watching TV and watching TV and then you know and she'll get up and sometimes she just nudges me, get up, get up, you're falling asleep again.

DOCTOR P636
Yeah, thatâ€™s what you gotta avoid.  So if you feel yourself kind of falling asleep like that, you got to get yourself up and do something like.  You know sometimes I'll go with my girlfriend and go for a walk.  Just go for a walk around the block you know.  It doesn't need to be real long but like 15 minutes of moving around helps stimulate you know your body cause otherwise after dinner, as soon as I eat dinner or as soon as I eat lunch, I'll fall asleep.

PATIENT P636
Oh man I'm like that.

DOCTOR P636
Yeah everyone does that.  So you got to come up with some methods otherwise you're just going to be up all night too.

PATIENT P636
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR P636
Alright you're all set.

PATIENT P636
Alright sounds good.

DOCTOR P636
I'll see you back in how long, when do you want to see me, a couple of months?

PATIENT P636
Yeah, whenever you think is good.

DOCTOR P636
Okay, let's do.

PATIENT P636
Do I need to take this any place?

DOCTOR P636
Yeah you take it up front.

PATIENT P636
Oh up front.

DOCTOR P636
Yeah so as far as the medications go, um you can't call in to our Pharmacy.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
And pick up medicine so.

PATIENT P636
So I have to call it in and wait till they send it.

DOCTOR P636
Exactly.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
Or you can go downstairs and try to grab it right now.  I would just check and see, maybe at 2 o'clock you know um, there may not be that many people waiting down there.

PATIENT P636
Just go down there.  I'll probably do that.

DOCTOR P636
I'd like you not to miss any of your blood pressure pills.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
I'd rather you take the whole, it kind of negates the whole thing.

PATIENT P636
Yeah I have like only, I think like four left.

DOCTOR P636
Yeah so you're going to have to pick up some downstairs.

PATIENT P636
Okay.

DOCTOR P636
So you can go up there @@@ and then go grab a cup of coffee downstairs @@@ and then come back and then pick them up.  Okay.  Take care okay.  Let me know if you have any problems.

PATIENT P636
Okay I sure will.
