DOCTOR K223
Both of them.

SECOND PERSON K223
Okay.

DOCTOR K223
The top number can give us a lot of information.  Okay.  So I'll go and talk with the attending and we might want to come down on the Lasix just a little bit uh you think it’s getting better.  Um but we'll watch it okay.  Other than that and other things that we should be talking about right now but look at them all of them at the time.

PATIENT K223

SECOND PERSON K223
Okay.

DOCTOR K223

SECOND PERSON K223

DOCTOR K223
