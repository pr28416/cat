DOCTOR K343
It's been a while.  Come on back here.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
How you doing today?

PATIENT K343
Hmm the same.

DOCTOR K343
Hanging in there?

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Trying to figure out @@@ huh.

PATIENT K343
Uh, yeah two of @@@ now.

DOCTOR K343
Oh it looks like the sun's coming out.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.  It was raining when I first got here.

DOCTOR K343
Oh yeah, it was raining when I left the house at 6 something this morning.  Yeah it was really coming down.  So we'll go over a few things, go ahead and take a seat.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Run through your medicines and what not.

PATIENT K343
I need to have some of my medicine refilled I guess.

DOCTOR K343
Sure, well not a problem.  We'll take good care by all means. Um let's see, no I don't know that I've seen you before.  This may be the first time I'm meeting you.

PATIENT K343
I think so.

DOCTOR K343
I'm going to take a look.  Oh no last year I saw you in August.

PATIENT K343
Oh last year.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah.

PATIENT K343
So that could be that I don't remember everybody's face you know.

DOCTOR K343
That's alright @@@.  I thought I recognized you.  So today you're here for medication review, anything is new or any other complaints?

PATIENT K343
Uh not really uh.

DOCTOR K343
Okay.

PATIENT K343
I'm going to get my knee replaced sometime.

DOCTOR K343
Sure.

PATIENT K343
But I don't know when.

DOCTOR K343
Have you already seen the doctor about that?

PATIENT K343
Well yeah but I can't get it done until um probably in late fall or maybe early spring.

DOCTOR K343
And that's because?

PATIENT K343
Because my wife is sick and all that.

DOCTOR K343
Oh, oh okay.

PATIENT K343
You know that's, but I need a bunch of the medicine refilled.  I don't know what some of this stuff is.  @@@.

DOCTOR K343
@@@ by all means, sometimes if you don't know what it is that means you won't take it.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
So we better make sure you know uh exactly what's going on with your health.

PATIENT K343
Well I know what some of them are.

DOCTOR K343
How are you, okay let's go through them.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
You tell the names they are, I have them in front of me as we go through them I'll tell you what they're for.

PATIENT K343
Okay, yeah, this one has got 11 refills, this has got 3 refills.  

DOCTOR K343
Albuterol, allopurinol.  This one's for breathing.

PATIENT K343
Right.

DOCTOR K343
That one's for gout.

PATIENT K343
Right.

DOCTOR K343
Let me see if you have enough refills on that.  Three refills on the allopurinol so that's nine months.

PATIENT K343
Yeah I know, I don't need that one.

DOCTOR K343
Good.

PATIENT K343
But the uh.

DOCTOR K343
Allopurinol you're good.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.  The other one is the.

DOCTOR K343
Amlodipine.

PATIENT K343
Yeah, what's that?

DOCTOR K343
That one's for your blood pressure.

PATIENT K343
Okay and there's no refills left on that.

DOCTOR K343
Okay.  I will renew it.  Do you want me to send it to you in the mail?

PATIENT K343
Well I think I have it at home.

DOCTOR K343
Do you have enough for a week or so?

PATIENT K343
Oh yeah, yeah I'm sure I do.

DOCTOR K343
These are some we'll send in the mail then.

PATIENT K343
Yes.

DOCTOR K343
Will that work out okay for you?

PATIENT K343
Yeah that's fine, that's fine.

DOCTOR K343
Okay.

PATIENT K343
And uh calcium that's going to expire too but I filled that.

DOCTOR K343
Calcium, looks like you have one refill left.

PATIENT K343
Right.

DOCTOR K343
That's the calcium vitamin D yeah.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Do you want me to give you some new refills?

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Let's do that.  I'll give you three more refills for that.

PATIENT K343
Okay.  Coricidin I don't need, that's four.

DOCTOR K343
Okay.

PATIENT K343
And uh flunisolide or whatever that is, that's what I get.

DOCTOR K343
Flunisolide, that's for the spray in the nose.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
I see you have fluticasone, you have two of them.  We probably don't need both.  One's a steroid; they're both steroid-like.  Do you use both of them?

PATIENT K343
What uh, yes I do.

DOCTOR K343
You use both.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Okay.  So you need a refill on the fluticasone.  The flunisolide looks like you have five refills left.

PATIENT K343
Yeah the other one I don't need that one.

DOCTOR K343
So you just need this one.

PATIENT K343
Right, okay.  

DOCTOR K343
That we can do.

PATIENT K343
Okay and the flunisolide has three refills.  Okay what is this thing?

DOCTOR K343
Oh let me see.

PATIENT K343
Oh that's my injection thing.

DOCTOR K343
Yep.

PATIENT K343
It says no refills but I don’t know.

DOCTOR K343
I'm not going to refill that.  That's the implant that they put in there, you know what I mean, for your, that's from the Urology Clinic.

PATIENT K343
Right.

DOCTOR K343
So that's not something that I would do.

PATIENT K343
Okay that's fine.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah.

PATIENT K343
Uh because I don't have, they’ll let me know.  I have 84 days before I can jump. 
DOCTOR K343
Yeah.

PATIENT K343
But the indomethacin that's gone.

DOCTOR K343
That's for the gout.

PATIENT K343
Right.

DOCTOR K343
Uh do not until you finish the prednisone, so when did that get refilled?  Did you have a gout attack recently?

PATIENT K343
No but that keeps it away.

DOCTOR K343
Do you take that all the time?

PATIENT K343
Yep.

DOCTOR K343
Well you just need to be careful, that one can be dangerous to your kidneys.

PATIENT K343
I know that what's they said.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah.

PATIENT K343
But I've been on it so long and I don't have any kidney problems.

DOCTOR K343
Well I don't want to just blindly refill it.  Let me uh; let me look at it closely here.

PATIENT K343
Cause I've been taking @@@ too.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah you're taking a lot of things for your gout and has been troublesome for you before?

PATIENT K343
Oh it can.

DOCTOR K343
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K343
When I had the surgery on my knee they took me off that.  Three days later the underneath swelled up.

DOCTOR K343
Oh yeah.

PATIENT K343
And it hurt worse than surgery did.  But the indomethacin I've actually for, I bet you 15 years or more.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah.  Well your kidneys are not entirely normal last time they were checked.

PATIENT K343
Well he put me on another one that I don't know, I don't two capfuls a day, I only take one because they put me on some other things that supposedly easier.  I don't know what the name of it is.

DOCTOR K343
Allopurinol?

PATIENT K343
What is that?

DOCTOR K343
And colchicine.  You take a lot of medicines for gout.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
I don't know, I don't know that I feel very comfortable giving you the indomethacin.  Let me talk it over with my attending.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Your renal function here is not great.  Normally for you it probably would be about 1 and that's the creatinine I look at.  The last time it was checked was about a year ago and it was 1.7, so what I want to do is probably check it again today before I refill that.

PATIENT K343
Okay, that's fine.

DOCTOR K343
To make sure your kidneys are doing okay cause we don't want to put you into kidney failure.

PATIENT K343
No.

DOCTOR K343
I think we'll hold off on refilling that one for now, until we get your blood work back okay.

PATIENT K343
Okay.  I was going to ask you, do I have to go downstairs to get the blood work?

DOCTOR K343
Yeah you're going to have to.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Looks like you had your PSA drawn not long ago.

PATIENT K343
Yeah the other day.  I think Monday or so I think it was, it whatever.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT K343
@@@ omeprazole.

DOCTOR K343
Omeprazole that's for your stomach.

PATIENT K343
Oh there's no refills up on that.

DOCTOR K343
Do you have, did they give it for you for GERD?  Let's take a look.

PATIENT K343
I don't know what they gave it to me for.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah I remember this.  We talked about this before.  I'm looking at my note from August and in this note I said encouraged to titrate off indomethacin due to chronic renal insufficiency but you were very hesitant.

PATIENT K343
I was and I think I still am.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah.  Would like to see improvement 20% @@@.  Yeah that's right we gave you the allopurinol at a renal dose.  Yeah and we started colchicine.  I remembered all this now, it's all coming back.  It's all coming back.  It's been a while.  Hmm and hold off on knee replacement due to medical illness of wife.  Yeah I remember all that.  I'm just reading through my previous notes.  Um what I think would be reasonable is to see what happens if we stop the indomethacin because we now started a new medicine the colchicine.  Have you been taking that pretty regularly?

PATIENT K343
Yeah I take one tablet a day or whatever it is.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah.  It's one tablet every day.

PATIENT K343
Yeah one tablet in the morning every day.

DOCTOR K343
Let me talk with my boss and we'll get repeat labs too and uh it may be worthwhile.  The reason I said is we don't want to hurt your kidneys.  

PATIENT K343
Well I know I understand that.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah that's the only reason.  We talked about that last time.

PATIENT K343
Right.

DOCTOR K343
Uh the omeprazole I can refill, that's not a problem and I'll send you that in the mail.  Let me advise him about the colchicine.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
I'm sorry the indomethacin.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Okay other question, other @@@ on the medicine?

PATIENT K343
No I think that's everything.  Make sure we’re on the same page.

DOCTOR K343
How about the metoprolol do you still take that?

PATIENT K343
Uh, I take a half tablet by mouth yeah.  I do take that.

DOCTOR K343
You've got two refills so I'm going to give you some more.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
And the other one that we need to talk about is your, is the two medicines that are expired.  One is the simvastatin, that's your cholesterol medicine.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
You're only taking a half a tablet at bedtime?

PATIENT K343
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR K343
Do you still have it?

PATIENT K343
Yeah they still had some.

DOCTOR K343
You still have some but it looked like it expired already.  I'm going to refill then okay.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
And then they'll send you some in the mail.  @@@ seven days @@@.

PATIENT K343
That's right you went to Michigan State didn't you?

DOCTOR K343
I did, I did.  I think we talked about this last time.

PATIENT K343
Yeah, I think we did.

DOCTOR K343
You went to uh you had a daughter or you had somebody that went to Michigan right?

PATIENT K343
Oh my uh my wife's husband went to Michigan State and then one of the daughters went there.

DOCTOR K343
Okay.

PATIENT K343
But the other daughter went to the University of Michigan.

DOCTOR K343
Gotcha, so there was a little bit of a battling.

PATIENT K343
Just somewhat.

DOCTOR K343
Just somewhat.

PATIENT K343
(Laughter)

DOCTOR K343
And you're from Michigan originally right?

PATIENT K343
Right, right.

DOCTOR K343
We'll give you @@@ okay, I'm going to reorder that.  I reordered that medicine yeah so, we'll see, it should be an interesting year this year for Michigan State.

PATIENT K343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K343
You think the football season's going to go okay?

PATIENT K343
I would think so.  Well they've changed one of the coaches and all that so.  You know how that goes; if you don't win they get rid of you.

DOCTOR K343
@@@.  Okay I'm going to send you a refill on the statin medicine.

PATIENT K343
But really check on the indomethacin because.

DOCTOR K343
I will yeah.

PATIENT K343
Uh I've been taking that so long and I haven't had any problems.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah.  I know it's a good medicine for your knee and it'll work well both with your knee pain but we definitely have to be careful with that kidney.

PATIENT K343
Yeah I know, I know.

DOCTOR K343
You don't want.

PATIENT K343
I think they check my kidney stuff all the time.

DOCTOR K343
The last time it was checked was uh, I just looked at them, see it was May, May of last year.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
So it's been a year.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Unless are you following in a different hospital for it?

PATIENT K343
No, no.

DOCTOR K343
Only here right?

PATIENT K343
I don't follow with anyone outside.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah the last time it's been checked was May so for sure we need to get some more blood work.

PATIENT K343
Okay, yeah @@@.

DOCTOR K343
We'll need to check your cholesterol and make sure that's okay.  You don't take any diabetic, you don't have diabetes right.

PATIENT K343
No, no.

DOCTOR K343
So we're not going to check that.  How about your last colonoscopy?  When did you have a colonoscopy last do you remember?  That's where they go and they use a camera and they look up from behind to see if there's any.

PATIENT K343
Oh God I don't remember now but it's been quite a while.

DOCTOR K343
I'll look.  You've gotten all your care here at Hines.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Okay, well I'll look into it when I go talk to the boss.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Just make sure that everything else is squared away.  Blood pressure today was a little on the higher side.

PATIENT K343
Right.

DOCTOR K343
A little on the higher side.

PATIENT K343
Well I walked a long ways too.

DOCTOR K343
Right.  Why don't we have you go sit up there and I'll let you sit down about five minutes, calm down then I'll recheck your blood pressure and we'll see how it goes.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Now let me just look at the rest of the things here.  Heart rate's good.  Let's see, how about the prostate?

PATIENT K343
Uh as far as I know everything is fine.

DOCTOR K343
When was the last time you saw those guys?

PATIENT K343
Uh I seen the doctor I don't know, I think it was a week or so ago.  I'd have to check my calendar.

DOCTOR K343
You saw the prostate guy?

PATIENT K343
Yeah.  He interviewed me again and they took my, they gave me my shot and then they interviewed me after that.

DOCTOR K343
The knee guy, not the knee guys right?

PATIENT K343
No, no.

DOCTOR K343
You came to the clinic before oh I see, here's something.  You were taking the valsartan before right?

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
And that ran out so you stopped it.  That's probably why and you came in to see DOCTOR because of a runny nose too right?

PATIENT K343
Yeah right and that stuff's been really good.  I think basically the runny nose is caused by some of these; I could be allergic to some of the new plants that come up.

DOCTOR K343
Gotcha.

PATIENT K343
You know.

DOCTOR K343
How's your skin been doing?

PATIENT K343
Fine.

DOCTOR K343
Is it dry still or no?

PATIENT K343
Well it's a little dry.

DOCTOR K343
Okay.  And you're taking the valsartan at home is that right or is that one been stopped?

PATIENT K343
Which one is that?

DOCTOR K343
That expired.  That's the blood pressure medicine.  I don't think it's on your list.

PATIENT K343
No it's not.  I probably don't take that anymore; they probably put me on something else.

DOCTOR K343
@@@ squared away here.  How about your thyroid medicine?

PATIENT K343
It's fine.  Uh the last time I seen you everything was fine.

DOCTOR K343
Your thyroid level was really high though.

PATIENT K343
Well, what happened I think when I had my thyroid removed in 77, they only took part of it and the other part continued to work and then it started to whatever elevate or whatever, whatever it does and that's when they changed my medicine and they been adjusting that but I, I don't know I think I see him in December and I don't think he changed anything then.  

DOCTOR K343
Hmm.  This says it's markedly elevated but informed him it was no different than last year.  I'm trying to figure out if they decided that you're supposed to be taking thyroid medicine or @@@.  Okay.  So you should be taking the Synthroid, your thyroid medicine.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.  I think I do.  Is that on my list?

DOCTOR K343
It's not on your list here.  Oh it is on your list, I'm sorry.  @@@.  Yeah you have two more refills.  You have enough for six more months.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Okay that's good.  Alright.  I'm sorry I got a little nervous there.

PATIENT K343
That's alright.  What would you guys do without those computers?

DOCTOR K343
We'd have to write everything down.  Just like we used to do, yeah just like we used to do.  Could you take that sweatshirt off so I can check your blood pressure?

PATIENT K343
Oh sure.  Here let me take my lid off.

DOCTOR K343
Alright.

PATIENT K343
There you go.  You want both arms?

DOCTOR K343
No one arm is okay.  Let's see if there's anything we need to do about your blood pressure.  Looks like they got you @@@.

PATIENT K343
Yeah that was the uh the thing I came in and gave blood on me.

DOCTOR K343
Monday?

PATIENT K343
Monday and that's unusual cause normally I don't bruise but whatever day she dug around in there.

DOCTOR K343
Gotcha.

PATIENT K343
And then they got me.

DOCTOR K343
The vampire got you.

PATIENT K343
Yep.

DOCTOR K343
Just relax your arm for me, let me hold it up, @@@.  It'll squeeze on the arm.  Perfect.  I got 118/65.

PATIENT K343
See cause I walked the whole way so.

DOCTOR K343
Perfect.

PATIENT K343
They make me walk a long ways and wonder why you're blood pressure goes up.

DOCTOR K343
Hey it's normal.  Of course they go up.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Let me just document that.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Alright.  Before you slide that all the way down, I'm okay, you're okay.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Just take some deep breaths.  Good again, again, again, again.  Now let me just listen here.  I'll have you lay back for me.

PATIENT K343
Oh.

DOCTOR K343
Be on your belly a little bit.

PATIENT K343
Okay.  I can do that.

DOCTOR K343
That's something to support your leg.

PATIENT K343
Okay thanks.

DOCTOR K343
Any belly pain?

PATIENT K343
Nope.

DOCTOR K343
Nausea, vomiting?

PATIENT K343
Nope.

DOCTOR K343
Diarrhea, constipation?

PATIENT K343
Nope.

DOCTOR K343
You can sit up.  You been urinating okay?

PATIENT K343
Yes.  Ain't no problems.

DOCTOR K343
No trouble with starting and stopping?

PATIENT K343
Nope.

DOCTOR K343
You got some dry skin here?

PATIENT K343
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR K343
Is that normal for you?

PATIENT K343
Yeah it's kind of normal.

DOCTOR K343
It could be related to your thyroid but they just increased the medicine not long ago so we'll check a bunch of labs today actually.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
It looks like the last PSA was just fine and that was just Monday.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Uh and your thyroid level was checked in March and that actually was normal.  So it's pretty fluctuant.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Wow, hmm, it was 127 in December and then it was 0.02 in March, really interesting.  Okay let me go talk to the boss.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
I'll be back in to see you in a second.

PATIENT K343
Okay that's fine.

DOCTOR K343
I've got most of your medications refilled, everything you need today.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Um we're going to have to get labs done and I'll look and make sure there's nothing else we're missing.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Thanks.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
@@@

PATIENT K343
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  69:26  DOCTOR IN:  80:20)

DOCTOR K343
Okay, so here's what we came up with as far as the indomethacin.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
You're taking it twice a day now?

PATIENT K343
No, no just once.

DOCTOR K343
Just once a day.

PATIENT K343
Once a day cause I take that other one.

DOCTOR K343
Yeah, the other one, the allopurinol and the colchicine.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
One uh, one thing that I think I need to continue stressing with you is if you keep going on this medicine particularly it will continue to harm your kidneys.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
And eventually just because of that medicine you may need to go on dialysis.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
That's something that you need to think about down the road.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
One thing I would consider and encourage to you is to prove to yourself that you may not need it now because we've given you these other medicines.

PATIENT K343
I will try to take.

DOCTOR K343
Could you take it every other day?

PATIENT K343
I'll try to take it every other day.

DOCTOR K343
And see what happens.

PATIENT K343
And see what happens.

DOCTOR K343
I'd like to give it a shot.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
If you can take it every other day and you're doing good and you do it for a month, maybe try taking every third day.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
Cause that medicine, I'm okay with you taking it but every day or more frequently it's going to continue to hurt your kidneys.

PATIENT K343
Okay.  Alright.

DOCTOR K343
Eventually I'd like to get you off of it completely.

PATIENT K343
Well I can, I'll just, when I do my pill thing.

DOCTOR K343
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K343
I'll just put, just put it every other day and then if that works then I'll go every other two days you know.

DOCTOR K343
@@@.

PATIENT K343
And then if it uh, I don't have any problems then I'll go every four days.

DOCTOR K343
@@@ and eventually what the medicine will be good for is you don't take it unless you have a flare.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Then if you have a flare-up then you take it every day for a week or two.

PATIENT K343
Yeah.

DOCTOR K343
That's what I'd like you to do.

PATIENT K343
Okay.  I can do that.

DOCTOR K343
So we'll give it to you by mail again every other day so you'll get uh four refills but you have to promise that you're gonna do that.

PATIENT K343
I will.

DOCTOR K343
Uh the rest of them we refilled I think, is that right?

PATIENT K343
As far as I know.

DOCTOR K343
Labs today that are going to be important for you.

PATIENT K343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K343
It looks like your CBC which is the blood that you have.

PATIENT K343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K343
@@@ blood in there.  We'll check your urine, I'm sorry we'll check your kidneys.  We don't need to check your urine.

PATIENT K343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K343
I also want to check your uric acid level; that sort of tells us how the gout's doing.  Last time it was really high.  We'll check and see how that's going and I'm going to also check your thyroid okay.

PATIENT K343
Okay.  Did you need blood for all that?

DOCTOR K343
Blood is all of that.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
That's alright and they just checked your prostate so we don't really need to check that.

PATIENT K343
Uh uh.

DOCTOR K343
Alright and then I'll see you back in uh, oh nine months?

PATIENT K343
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K343
You're doing pretty good otherwise.

PATIENT K343
Well otherwise I'm fine.  But I just want a gout attack.

DOCTOR K343
I don’t blame you.  I mean you have to think about no gout attack versus we don't want it to continue to bottom out your kidneys.

PATIENT K343
Do I have to take this with me?

DOCTOR K343
Yeah you can just take it up to the front and give it to them.

PATIENT K343
Oh I see.

DOCTOR K343
Check out okay.  Alright.

PATIENT K343
I'll check this.

DOCTOR K343
And for right now you won't need to take that, losartan the other medicine for your blood pressure, the one that you don't have on your list.

PATIENT K343
Oh yeah I probably haven't taken it.

DOCTOR K343
Right that's why I say we'll hold it for now.

PATIENT K343
Okay, @@@.

DOCTOR K343
Don't forget to go down to the Lab.

PATIENT K343
I won't.

DOCTOR K343
Have the blood work done.

PATIENT K343
I won't.  

DOCTOR K343
If there's any problems or any changes I'll call you.

PATIENT K343
Okay.

DOCTOR K343
Okay.

PATIENT K343
That's fine.

DOCTOR K343
Take care, nice to see you again.

PATIENT K343
Nice to see you.
