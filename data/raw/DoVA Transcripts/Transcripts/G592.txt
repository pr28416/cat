DOCTOR G592
PATIENT.

PATIENT G592 
I'm right here.

DOCTOR G592
@@@.

PATIENT G592
Oh okay.

DOCTOR G592
So we'll come back here.

PATIENT G592
Yeah.

DOCTOR G592
Right across the way there.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
It's on your left or on your right side, down here to the right.  We last saw each other back like in April or so.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
And then looking at the notes you've been here a couple times in the interim at Urgent Care for uh testicular pain, URI symptoms.  How is that stuff doing now?

PATIENT G592
I've got some still coughing.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.

PATIENT G592
I need to find out why I'm coughing instead of somebody giving me a pump to open up the airways, I’m not interested in that. And my @@@ but my back is giving problems.

DOCTOR G592
Still bothering you.

PATIENT G592
Yes.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.

PATIENT G592
I think I just.

DOCTOR G592
So how long total have you been coughing for now, would you say how many months?

PATIENT G592
I'd say I been probably since the last time I come over here.

DOCTOR G592
Since April?

PATIENT G592
No.

DOCTOR G592
Oh.  Since so, I saw you in April.

PATIENT G592
Yeah.

DOCTOR G592
We talked about your back and your diabetes and then you came into the Urgent Care in May.

PATIENT G592
For coughing.

DOCTOR G592
Uh your stomach hurt and then uh in July it looks like you came in with four days of a nonproductive cough, runny nose and sore throat and that was back in July and so are you still.

PATIENT G592
No I didn't tell them, I come here, I was coughing, I told them I was coughing and it was a dry cough.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.

PATIENT G592
I didn't tell them nothing about my nose running.

DOCTOR G592
So how many months would you say it's been going on for then total?

PATIENT G592
I'd say it's been going on for four months.

DOCTOR G592
Four months okay.

PATIENT G592
@@@.

DOCTOR G592
Dry cough and what seems to bring it about?

PATIENT G592
I don't know just sometimes I just start coughing.

DOCTOR G592
No known triggers, so it's not like um, is there something you can think of in terms of time of day, exposure to potential allergens?

PATIENT G592
Well sometimes it's at night.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.

PATIENT G592
And sometimes in the daytime, sometimes it's at night.  I drink water sometime and that helps but I just start coughing and like.

DOCTOR G592
Any history of acid reflux or heartburn?

PATIENT G592
No, no doctor's ever told me.

DOCTOR G592
Do you ever experience after you eat that you get a burning in your chest at all?

PATIENT G592
No.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.  Any history of um postnasal drip or feeling anything drip down the back of your throat?

PATIENT G592
Well you know but I think you know my first instinct is I think I may have sinus.

DOCTOR G592
What did you think that?

PATIENT G592
Sometime, just according to the weather, sometimes my nostrils sometimes start just dripping.

DOCTOR G592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G592
And that's the reason I think I because years ago I didn't wear a hat and it could be ever so cold outside and I didn't put nothing on my head so I think that I might have some kind of sinus cause most of my work, I work with the airlines so most of my work for at least 15 years was outside.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.  Let me just see if we ever did any.  I mean I guess you could argue that after four months we should think about getting a chest x-ray.  Do you have a significant smoking history?

PATIENT G592
I never smoked in my life.

DOCTOR G592
Good.  And then - cause you don't have . . . and uh the lisinopril, how long have you been on this?  Do you feel like when you started taking the lisinopril back in April is that around when your cough started?

PATIENT G592
No.

DOCTOR G592
Or had you been on that before? To treat your blood pressure.  So you had been on @@@ and we changed you over to lisinopril.

PATIENT G592
Right.

DOCTOR G592
And so do you feel like, is that around the time when your cough started when they changed those medications around?

PATIENT G592
Well.

DOCTOR G592
Certain people, sometimes lisinopril can cause people to have a cough.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
Do you feel that's when the cough started?

PATIENT G592
Well I knew I started coughing but why I started coughing I don't know.

DOCTOR G592
Yeah but do you feel @@@ that those were related?

PATIENT G592
Well I really can't say.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.  Definitely something to think about.  And how much is this cough bothering you?  Is it a lot?

PATIENT G592
Well it concerns me that I'm coughing.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.

PATIENT G592
And I'm, you know, I’m deeply concerned about the coughing so I was recently in a program, a medical program here in Chicago and the head doctor here in Chicago, I think its DOCTOR.

DOCTOR G592
DOCTOR yeah.

PATIENT G592
DOCTOR he said that people are usually coughing like that he said that it could be some other problems that is affecting the body and they should do tests.

DOCTOR G592
Okay, no you're absolutely, you're absolutely right.  And I may just have this piece of paper @@@ just grab this.  Okay.  Okay yeah, so you're right.  So we are going to investigate this.  We probably should just get a chest x-ray since it's been going on for so long but it could very well be either as simple as seasonal allergies, especially a bit of congestion versus um taking the lisinopril can often induce a cough uh in people so then we could just switch you to another medicine so.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
So we'll do some of those things.  You could just get the chest x-ray today cause if you're concerned you might as well just get the chest x-ray so they can prove that there’s nothing serious going on then everybody can sleep a little bit easier.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
So we can do that.  Let's see we can do that today, I'll set you up.  And so the other things we talked about um last time you were here was your diabetes, we talked about it for a while.  Because when you were seen back in April your diabetes was pretty poorly controlled so how have your sugars been at home since then?

PATIENT G592
Well, I consider myself doing a pretty good job of controlling that.

DOCTOR G592
What kind of numbers are we getting with our glucometer?

PATIENT G592
Well the numbers is sometimes right on the borderline for me but like I say, like I told you before I don't eat uh, I don't eat nothing that has sugar in it.  I don't put a lot of salt or nothing on there and I'm eating smaller portions of food.

DOCTOR G592
Good.

PATIENT G592
Okay.  I do eat a little bit more, instead of eating once or twice or three times a day.

DOCTOR G592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G592
I might eat four times.

DOCTOR G592
Good.

PATIENT G592
You know but I eat smaller portions.

DOCTOR G592
But what kind of numbers are you getting like you know first thing in the morning for example.  Before you eat breakfast what kind of reading have you been getting in your blood sugars?

PATIENT G592
Well I'm getting under 200s.  I'm getting 100s to 200s @@@.

DOCTOR G592
We want them between 90 and 125 ideally.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
So it's better than above 200.

PATIENT G592
Yes.

DOCTOR G592
Hopefully but it's not quite where we want it.  So next time, if you could even bring your glucometer in that would also be helpful so we could go through it.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
Together, so we're gonna check your A1c today to see how that is doing and what kind of numbers are you getting after meals would you say?

PATIENT G592
Well?

DOCTOR G592
How many times a day are you checking your sugars?

PATIENT G592
I'm only checking them one time.

DOCTOR G592
Okay and that's usually first thing in the morning before breakfast?

PATIENT G592
Yeah.

DOCTOR G592
And that's fine, but yeah that means that we got a and certainly if you're doing your part with the uh eating habits @@@ getting you on some better medicines and it looks like you're supposed to be taking now the glipizide 20 mg twice a day, perfect.  okay and why aren't you on metformin? Have you ever taken metformin?

PATIENT G592
Metformin had an affect on the kidneys.

DOCTOR G592
@@@ so that's perfect okay.  So it was making me something crazy for why you weren't on it and it looks like um let's see and concerning your blood pressure are you checking your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT G592
Yes.

DOCTOR G592
What kind of numbers are you getting?

PATIENT G592
I've been getting real good numbers because I was a little upset when I saw she had over there.

DOCTOR G592
131/77.

PATIENT G592
No she had the first number.

DOCTOR G592
143/82 yeah.

PATIENT G592
Right and I told her for me to wait for a few minutes and take it over again.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.

PATIENT G592
And probably if you would take it now it's probably lower because I get a little excited when I come to the doctor's office.

DOCTOR G592
Uh-huh and what have you been getting at home?

PATIENT G592
I been getting uh I been getting something like the other day I got 68/123.

DOCTOR G592
Great.

PATIENT G592
Numbers like that.

DOCTOR G592
Good 120/68.  So blood pressure, that sounds like you're doing really great, excellent.

PATIENT G592
But they done told me you know that uh the blood pressure if it stays up high it would do damage to my organs.

DOCTOR G592
Exactly.

PATIENT G592
So they told me they wanted to get it down to the lower levels and that's why I've been really working on it.

DOCTOR G592
Good, that's really good.

PATIENT G592
And I have lost weight too doc.

DOCTOR G592
Let's see, your cover sheet here, yeah wow you've lost seven pounds.  What do you attribute this too, just trying to eat smaller portions?

PATIENT G592
I been just eating smaller portions.  I don't eat late at night.

DOCTOR G592
Great.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
Wow.

PATIENT G592
After about 9 o'clock at night I don't have no food.  I just drink a lot of water now.

DOCTOR G592
Good.

PATIENT G592
I don't drink pop but I never have been a big pop drinker.

DOCTOR G592
Excellent.

PATIENT G592
I do drink a little orange juice.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.

PATIENT G592
About 4 ounces a day, in the morning, because of the potassium.

DOCTOR G592
Yeah.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
Well 7 pounds, you know losing it like a healthy rate also it's not like you know this is gonna be a sustainable change for you, that's excellent, that's really great.  And did they tell you about the results of your colonoscopy already?  So basically, they saw a polyp that did not indicate cancer, um but these types of polyps can turn into cancer, they would want to get a repeat on you in five years.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
So but nothing scary now.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
So you're wrapped up with that and then so tell me about this back pain, what's gonna happen now?

PATIENT G592
Well the back pain I had a.

DOCTOR G592
I know we talked before that you had um you know a herniated disk.

PATIENT G592
Right.

DOCTOR G592
And that you had tried some physical therapy and how do you feel that things are going since you were here last?

PATIENT G592
Well I'm still having, still having back problems uh.  I guess some of it I should have been over here in the gym taking therapy.  I'm used to taking exercise over in the gym.

DOCTOR G592
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G592
They do have a facility over here I can come and take exercise.

DOCTOR G592
Yeah.

PATIENT G592
I'm tending to think some of it was my fault for not getting up and getting over here taking exercise.

DOCTOR G592
So how far do you live?  How far north or south of here is Warren?

PATIENT G592
Uh one block past Madison.

DOCTOR G592
Oh so you don't live that far.

PATIENT G592
No.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.

PATIENT G592
No.

DOCTOR G592
Okay yeah so if you lived like way on the north or on the south side then yeah.  Maybe you should just come in for physical therapy.  It looks like they tried to allegedly contact you a couple times um but basically if we want to send you to you know the back surgeons or anything we have to document that you've done three months of physical therapy here.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
So let's just go ahead and put that back in, let's give it a whirl.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
Let's see what happens and do need any Tylenol or any?

PATIENT G592
No, no.

DOCTOR G592
Okay good.

PATIENT G592
I'm not really for taking a lot of medications.

DOCTOR G592
Okay, good.  And we can also give you in addition to physical therapy there's a gym here um if you want a referral for that.

PATIENT G592
Oh I'd like to go to your gym.

DOCTOR G592
Yes, let me put in Recreation Therapy.  Oh yeah you live so close, @@@ I'll put in for a referral, that's in.  Okay.  Good.  @@@ and then let’s see what’s on our reminder list, I'll send a reminder, so did they give you your TDAP today or @@@ tetanus shot.  Are you amenable to getting a tetanus shot today?

PATIENT G592
Yes I'll take the tetanus.

DOCTOR G592
Okay perfect.  We'll put this in, that was ordered.

PATIENT G592
Put in a chest x-ray.

DOCTOR G592
Yeah you're gonna go do that after we're done here.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
That's about it.  Good, excellent and let's see here so you've already seen the eye doctors and let's see they don't need to see you back for a year from last time.  Oh here we go, oh uh they want to see you nine months after the first time so that's fine.  So it sounds like the main things that we're gonna do today are um so we'll try to stop this cough and see if there's any changes we should make to your medications to get your blood sugar under better control cause all you are on now for your diabetes right is the max dose of the glipizide and we don't have any diabetes labs since you were here last time.  Okay so do you get any low blood sugars like where you get dizzy, sweaty? Okay.  So let me just wash my hands and I’ll take a listen here.  And before you started seeing us here in April had you been taking any medicines for your diabetes previously or no?

PATIENT G592
Yes.

DOCTOR G592
Yeah.  You were already on the glipizide at that point?

PATIENT G592
Yes ma'am.

DOCTOR G592
Okay.  Okay.  Your lungs sound clear okay.  So let me see, so besides doing a chest x-ray let's see how many things we're gonna change today okay.  I'm going to talk to DOCTOR I'll be back in just a couple minutes.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  41:26  DOCTOR IN:  52:05)

DOCTOR G592
Alright here's what we're gonna do.  We're gonna do a couple things.  So the first thing is we're gonna change your medications around a little bit.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
And then we can get your chest x-ray done today so I'm gonna add another medicine for your diabetes, it's called Actos and it's just a pill you take once a day, @@@ no needles @@@ you're now gonna be taking you know two pills in the morning or like.

PATIENT G592
Three pills a day.

DOCTOR G592
Yeah and then still just your two pills at night.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
I'm gonna add this in and then keep checking your sugars and if you do find yourself getting you know hypoglycemic, sweaty, lightheaded, dizzy and you know sugars below 80s then stop taking the new medicine.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
So let me put that in.  @@@ okay.  We're good and then I'm also gonna change so you've been on Benicar before for your blood pressure and they switched you over to lisinopril.  Lisinopril can frequently give people a cough and usually Benicar won't so we're just gonna switch you back to the Benicar that you were on when you came in here.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
They put you on the lisinopril because it was cheaper, it was on the VA formulary but the cough is a very, very common reason for people to be switched over to Benicar.  And it looks like when you were seen here we weren't sure they had put you on that but that's totally fine so we will put that in and we'll take the lisinopril out medicines so perfect.  So we'll put you on Losartan because it's in the same class of medications.  It works the same way as lisinopril but it usually doesn't cause a cough okay.

PATIENT G592
So discontinue the lisinopril?

DOCTOR G592
Right you're gonna pick up this new medicine at the window instead.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
Try this out and we'll see how it does.  So we're gonna have you pick that up but the very, very first thing um we're gonna do is to have you go get that chest x-ray.  So let me just change it to stat so what we're gonna do is you're just gonna go get the chest x-ray done right now and then you'll just wait out here, I'll tell you that it's normal and then I'll have you go to the Pharmacy.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
So we'll just that way that will be off of our chest as it were and then we'll everything with that is good and then we'll also have you go down to the Lab today so we can look at your A1c.  We'll look at your blood glucose control for the past three months.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
So the two things we're gonna do now is um I'm actually going to get your TDAP right now so we'll put in the order.

PATIENT G592
Give you a copy of that.

DOCTOR G592
The yeah, so you're gonna do three things um right now.  We are gonna do, we're gonna have the nurse give you a shot.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
You're gonna go down to X-Ray and get that x-ray.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
You're gonna go to the Lab and get some blood drawn and just wait up here, I'll tell you everything looks great and then you're gonna go to the Pharmacy.

PATIENT G592
Okay they can take, when they draw the blood they can give you the results right away?

DOCTOR G592
No unfortunately the blood sugar for the past three months is gonna take a couple days to come back.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
But I can certainly give you a call when it comes back and the chest x-ray we're gonna have you back here for the results cause we'll have it back within an hour.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
So let's walk you over to the nurses' desk.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
Um it's just right here.  Just have a seat in here sir.

PATIENT G592
Okay.

DOCTOR G592
Okay and then you're just going to go down to the X-Ray and the Lab and then just wait out here and we'll let you know what the x-ray shows.

PATIENT G592
Thank you ma'am.

DOCTOR G592
Thank you.
