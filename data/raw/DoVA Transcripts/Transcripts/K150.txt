Time of Encounter:   @@@

DOCTOR K150
@@@.

PATIENT K150
Yes I know.

DOCTOR K150
How have you been? 

PATIENT K150
When I take the medications I'm fine.  The reason why I cancelled the last time was.

DOCTOR K150
Do you have your medicine list?

PATIENT K150
Yes.  When I cancelled the last appointment was because I had uh my diet was a little bit, left a lot to be desired and uh.

DOCTOR K150
You had diarrhea?

PATIENT K150
Well it was a five roll toilet paper day.

DOCTOR K150
Hmm.

PATIENT K150
Um since we had not seen each other once before, when I called to reschedule the appointment I said I have not seen this doctor before, schedule me with anybody.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.

PATIENT K150
Because since I've been here, I think I've seen four.

DOCTOR K150
Different doctors?

PATIENT K150
Absolutely.

DOCTOR K150
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

PATIENT K150
So now you're the fifth.

DOCTOR K150
Well you gave us.

PATIENT K150
So I said please, give me somebody.  I don't wait da da da and obviously that didn't seem to mean a hill of beans.  I've also been waiting here about three hours so I am not really a happy camper.

DOCTOR K150
Three hours?

PATIENT K150
I understood that, I understood that you started at 1 o'clock.

DOCTOR K150
Yeah.

PATIENT K150
I hear you, I didn't know but I just figured if I get here early.

DOCTOR K150
Oh no.

PATIENT K150
Yeah right, well that is never gonna happen again.

DOCTOR K150
Unfortunately yes, unfortunately because everyone has like their time slot.

PATIENT K150
Yeah, well it isn't gonna happen again.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  Alright let's go over the medicines that you're taking so I know what you're on.  You're still on the Combivent inhalant right?

PATIENT K150
I'm on everything.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.

PATIENT K150
I take it religiously.

DOCTOR K150
That's good.

PATIENT K150
If I take something a little bit lightly or lighter it's the inhalers and the reason then is because they open me up but unfortunately being a smoker I'm just going to have to cigarette probably 15-20 minutes so I don't think it opens me up.

DOCTOR K150
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT K150
Unfortunately.

DOCTOR K150
How many packs?

PATIENT K150
One.

DOCTOR K150
A day?

PATIENT K150
Yes.

DOCTOR K150
Trying to cut back?

PATIENT K150
I've given up on that one.  I've failed.

DOCTOR K150
How many times have you tried?

PATIENT K150
2 hard core times.

DOCTOR K150
Okay, so it's never too late right?

PATIENT K150
I don't lie to myself.

DOCTOR K150
Have you tried like any smoking cessation programs?

PATIENT K150
I think I did the patch once.

DOCTOR K150
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K150
I failed.  I tried twice hard core.

DOCTOR K150
What if you try to cut back slowly to like half a pack a day?

PATIENT K150
Yeah.

DOCTOR K150
Do you think you might be open to try that?

PATIENT K150
I don't lie to myself.

DOCTOR K150
You don't want to try but you do know your lungs could get worse right?

PATIENT K150
Of course.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  Just want to make sure.  Any shortness of breath though?

PATIENT K150
Of course.

DOCTOR K150
When do you usually get that?  When you're sitting down, not doing anything, when you're walking on an incline?

PATIENT K150
No.  Yeah I got to walk upstairs or I'm gonna you know if I exert myself I just know that it's not a great idea and uh doesn't help your lungs.

DOCTOR K150
Uh-huh.  Do you feel like you're using the albuterol more than usual?

PATIENT K150
No.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  How often are you using albuterol?

PATIENT K150
When necessary.

DOCTOR K150
How many times a week?

PATIENT K150
Once or twice.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  Do you drink?

PATIENT K150
I should but I don't.

DOCTOR K150
I'm glad you don't.  How long have you been smoking though?

PATIENT K150
Since I've been in the Marines.

DOCTOR K150
Hmm.  Do you live alone?

PATIENT K150
Yes.

DOCTOR K150
Family around in the Chicago area?

PATIENT K150
Yes.

DOCTOR K150
Do you have children?

PATIENT K150
Yes.

DOCTOR K150
Pretty supportive or do you see them?

PATIENT K150
I am supportive for them, yes for them.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  Okay.  Alright let me look at the labs you had done and then we can go from there.  Blood pressure is on the high side today.

PATIENT K150
Yes because I was aggravated.

DOCTOR K150
Do you check your blood pressure at home?  Okay.  Do you check your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT K150
I like the VA.  I'm a happy camper with the VA.

DOCTOR K150
Do you even know what time your appointment was?

PATIENT K150
This place has always been class act to me, I enjoy it.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.

PATIENT K150
The economics are outstanding.  But if I had to come here and pay, I’d kiss this place off in a heartbeat.

DOCTOR K150
It's not a bad place, you know that right?

PATIENT K150
Let us please move on.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  Let me look at your labs and then we'll go from there.  So the labs you had done last year were not that bad.  Your cholesterol was a bit on the high side.

PATIENT K150
So they gave me this whatever it is and I take a half a pill a day.

DOCTOR K150
Okay, looks good.

PATIENT K150
Until I run out.

DOCTOR K150
I can refill your medicines, it's not a problem.  Have you ever had.

PATIENT K150
When I was here, well I guess it was two weeks ago.

DOCTOR K150
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K150
I came through and filled everything for them.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT K150
Colonoscopy.

DOCTOR K150
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K150
Tell me what it is.

DOCTOR K150
You lay down, they give you like a bowel prep so you are having diarrhea constantly for like a day.

PATIENT K150
Is that something where they stick something in here?

DOCTOR K150
Through the rectum.

PATIENT K150
Never ever.

DOCTOR K150
You've never had it?

PATIENT K150
No nor am I going to.

DOCTOR K150
Why is that?

PATIENT K150
It just isn't gonna happen.

DOCTOR K150
Usually the reason why we recommend that.

PATIENT K150
Don't care.

DOCTOR K150
Let me explain first.

PATIENT K150
No.  No.  I don't want anything stuck in my rectum.

DOCTOR K150
Well you're aware of preventing colon cancer @@@ right?

PATIENT K150
It isn't gonna happen.

DOCTOR K150
You have increased risks.

PATIENT K150
It isn't going to happen.

DOCTOR K150
Any history.

PATIENT K150
It has been brought up before.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.

PATIENT K150
It isn't gonna happen.

DOCTOR K150
Any history of like cancers in your family?  No?

PATIENT K150
Not that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  So another screening that we do, because you're a smoker and you're age 65 is to screen for your large artery which is your aorta being enlarged.

PATIENT K150
I know.  It was suggested that I take…

DOCTOR K150
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K150
Uh the baby aspirin and I do.

DOCTOR K150
You do take the baby aspirin but at age 65, between age 65 and 75, we do have to do an ultrasound of the aorta to make sure the size is not enlarged.  Is that something you'd be interested in?  What do you think?

PATIENT K150
Uh when I was in the hospital I think five or six years ago, some kind of clogged blah, blah, blah and they did all that stuff.  They looked at the heart.

DOCTOR K150
So that was probably an ultrasound of the heart.  This one is an ultrasound of like the large vessels, also of the heart, mainly like an abdominal ultrasound looking for that.

PATIENT K150
Oh I know they showed me a picture, you know I was looking at it.

DOCTOR K150
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K150
Do you think it is necessary at this point in time?

DOCTOR K150
We could talk about it the next time I see you.

PATIENT K150
Fine.

DOCTOR K150
Sounds good.  Okay.  So today you ate already.  When do you think you have time to come back so maybe we can recheck the cholesterol?

PATIENT K150
How is it that you're gonna recheck it?  Is it a blood thing?

DOCTOR K150
Yeah.  But you would have to not eat.  I'm sure you did already today right?

PATIENT K150
Well uh when did uh.

DOCTOR K150
I’m sorry you have to wait.

PATIENT K150
No, no, no, no.  I think I had a plan.

DOCTOR K150
Huh?

PATIENT K150
I think I have a @@@.

DOCTOR K150
Which is?

PATIENT K150
Uh what is your schedule on the 7th of June?

DOCTOR K150
Well I don't need to see you.  You can just go down to the lab and get it done.  Yeah and then I follow up on it.

PATIENT K150
Then I'm for that.

DOCTOR K150
Huh?

PATIENT K150
Tell me what they're gonna do.

DOCTOR K150
It's just a blood draw.

PATIENT K150
Oh they're gonna take blood.

DOCTOR K150
And usually its better that you get that in the morning so the night before you won't eat, you would stop eating as of like 6:00 p.m. and then you get it done and then I'll follow up on it.  Now let me see.

PATIENT K150
One of the things they do good here.

DOCTOR K150
Which is?

PATIENT K150
Takes blood boom, @@@.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  So your blood pressure has been on the higher side.  I'll recheck it again today but it's something you need to keep a close eye on.

PATIENT K150
It was rechecked then.

DOCTOR K150
I'll recheck it myself.

PATIENT K150
Fine.

DOCTOR K150
Last year it was still up in the 140s, which around what it is right now.  Were you not really too happy the day last year when you had it done.  Do you remember?

PATIENT K150
No.

DOCTOR K150
Maybe that was the problem.

PATIENT K150
No there was no problem.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  So we'll keep an eye on that.

PATIENT K150
It's higher today.

DOCTOR K150
Huh?

PATIENT K150
It was higher today.

DOCTOR K150
Yeah.  So you would like to come back in June to get that done, do the cholesterol?

PATIENT K150
Yeah.  It's not a big thing.

DOCTOR K150
It's up to you.  Okay.

PATIENT K150
Uh make it on the 7th.

DOCTOR K150
Of June right?

PATIENT K150
Yeah.  I will live.  

DOCTOR K150
Really far?

PATIENT K150
60 miles one way.

DOCTOR K150
Oh gosh.  That's really far.

PATIENT K150
So I cruise.

DOCTOR K150
Do you have any other appointments during that time?

PATIENT K150
Yes.

DOCTOR K150
Okay you have an appointment on June 7th okay perfect.  Perfect, I didn't know that.  Okay, have a seat up here.

PATIENT K150
June 7th is a Tuesday and that's right.  So if you can set that thing up before I get, of course it doesn't take that long.  I guess at 1 o'clock.

DOCTOR K150
Yeah you can get it done whenever.  It doesn't matter.

PATIENT K150
All you do is schedule it, schedule the day.

DOCTOR K150
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K150
Fine.

DOCTOR K150
And you can come at whatever time you choose.

PATIENT K150
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR K150
You can have a seat up here.  So we'll check your cholesterol and get all that blood work then.  Any problems peeing, losing urine on yourself, not feeling like you've properly completely emptied your bladder?

PATIENT K150
No the only time I had was the last time I had to cancel the appointment and it was probably because I wasn't eating right or whatever.  So I backed off the medications, did a lot of water, cleared the system out.

DOCTOR K150
Hmm.

PATIENT K150
Probably about three days later got back on the medications, started eating properly and everything has been fine since.

DOCTOR K150
Uh-huh.  Chest pain, shortness of breath, feeling like your heart is pounding, beating really fast?  Just hold still for me if you can.

PATIENT K150
Okay.  In theory, let's see.

DOCTOR K150
Yeah.

PATIENT K150
Probably going to be 147 over.

DOCTOR K150
Because you're worked up.  I'm working you up.

PATIENT K150
No I'm working myself down.

DOCTOR K150
(Laughter).

PATIENT K150
147 over whatever it is 80s or something or less than that, 90 or something.  Am I close?

DOCTOR K150
You're close.  I got 148 over about 100.  

PATIENT K150
You know I don't have a clue what that means.

DOCTOR K150
Any leg swelling at all?

PATIENT K150
I'm sorry, say it again?

DOCTOR K150
And any leg swelling?

PATIENT K150
No.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  And no chest pain either right?

PATIENT K150
Thank goodness.

DOCTOR K150
And you know your smoking could do that.

PATIENT K150
That's bad enough.

DOCTOR K150
Any problems with your vision?

PATIENT K150
Uh well it's not 20/20.

DOCTOR K150
Do you wear glasses or contacts?

PATIENT K150
No.

DOCTOR K150
Do you feel like your vision is gradually worsening?

PATIENT K150
Manageable, manageable.

DOCTOR K150
Do you wear reading glasses?

PATIENT K150
It's gradually you know worsening.

DOCTOR K150
Do you want to see the Eye Clinic here?

PATIENT K150
No.

DOCTOR K150
Why?

PATIENT K150
I don't look for problems.

DOCTOR K150
You just don't want to know if there's something going on.

PATIENT K150
That is correct.  You know I don't want any invasive surgeries, anybody sticking anything you know.  It's just that they've taken blood here and they do it.

DOCTOR K150
So let me ask you this, let's say you never have a colonoscopy, you come in maybe 5-10 years from now very constipated, very bloated, having weight loss and we say hmm we think it may be maybe colon cancer or something like that.

PATIENT K150
I would tell you to do what they did when I was in Vietnam.

DOCTOR K150
Which is what?

PATIENT K150
Take this @@@ peragoric and eat a lot of peanut butter.

DOCTOR K150
That may not help.

PATIENT K150
If I'm alive in five to ten years from now I'm gonna be a happy camper.

DOCTOR K150
With cancer?

PATIENT K150
I'll be a happy camper.  If I make it another five, ten years, I'm gonna be a happy camper.

DOCTOR K150
So let's say at that stage you can't eat anything, you can't keep anything down because there's cancer in the colon backing things up and we can't really feed you right?

PATIENT K150
And I die? It happens to everyone.

DOCTOR K150
At that point, let me ask you would you decide on having part of your colon taken out?

PATIENT K150
No invasive surgery.

DOCTOR K150
Nothing.  Nothing.

PATIENT K150
I have all the parts that I'm gonna need that can last me.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.

PATIENT K150
They've taken a few parts out. I still have a bunch in.

DOCTOR K150
What parts did they take out?

PATIENT K150
Spleen.

DOCTOR K150
Why?

PATIENT K150
Motor accident.

DOCTOR K150
No heart surgeries ever?

PATIENT K150
No I've been very fortunate.

DOCTOR K150
That's good.

PATIENT K150
I know they cleaned my lungs out one time.

DOCTOR K150
Why?

PATIENT K150
Cause they were all clogged up.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT K150
You know where they stick the hose down you and clear everything out.

DOCTOR K150
Yeah.  Alright.  Lift up your shirt here.  Alright a deep breath for me.  Everything seems to be cleaned out.  When was the last time they had an x-ray.  Do you want me to give you over-the-counter Debrox, it's more like a drop you put in your ears.

PATIENT K150
Yes.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  Open your mouth; stick out your tongue ah.  @@@ protuding in and out.  Around your cheeks.

PATIENT K150
This side?

DOCTOR K150
Yeah.

PATIENT K150
Cause they pulled three teeth probably three weeks ago.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.

PATIENT K150
So.

DOCTOR K150
They pulled them here?

PATIENT K150
No, I don't have dental

DOCTOR K150
I thought they did.

PATIENT K150
Yeah well they have it, I don't qualify.

DOCTOR K150
Oh.  This is cold.

PATIENT K150
Warm heart.

DOCTOR K150
What's this over here?

PATIENT K150
Uh well I've been told it's supposedly a piece of fat.

DOCTOR K150
Yeah.  Is it bothering you at all?

PATIENT K150
Uh cosmetically but I can't see back there so I don't worry about it.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  I was going to offer something for you but I guess not.

PATIENT K150
There's a way to do it without cutting it?

DOCTOR K150
Yeah.

PATIENT K150
You have to cut it?

DOCTOR K150
Yes.  Alright lay on your back for me.  We'd have to cut it.  

PATIENT K150
@@@.

DOCTOR K150
Uh-huh, @@@ pain.  Just go ahead and sit up for me.  Have a seat right here.

PATIENT K150
Right where?

DOCTOR K150
Have a seat.  Alright so the main concern is the blood pressure.  We could do a couple of things.  Hold off on starting you on anything, have you follow up with the Pharmacy.

PATIENT K150
There is one thing on the blood pressure.

DOCTOR K150
What?

PATIENT K150
In my coffee this morning late.

DOCTOR K150
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K150
I did have a double shot of Espresso.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  They can send you a blood pressure cuff to your house and you can do that.

PATIENT K150
I'm just wondering if that was the reason why the blood pressure was high.

DOCTOR K150
It may or may not be but smoking does it too.  They can send you a blood pressure cuff, you can keep a log of, maybe checking it a couple times a week, I'll hold up on starting you on something right now.  I'll have you see the pharmacist, the registered pharmacist on June 7th if they can get an appointment, to see what the blood pressure has been.  If it's still high then we'll have to start you on something.

PATIENT K150
I'm started on everything.

DOCTOR K150
Not blood pressure medicine.  Okay.  So I just wanted to let you know about that.

PATIENT K150
You mean none of those things?

DOCTOR K150
No, it's none of them. 

PATIENT K150
I thought at least one or two of those things were supposed to.

DOCTOR K150
No.

PATIENT K150
Just no.  Mellow me out a little bit.

DOCTOR K150
There is medicine for anxiety, there's one for the inhaler and then the cholesterol and that's it.  Let me order these things and then you should be done.  So you said June 7th is the date.

PATIENT K150
Yes.  Correct, correct.

DOCTOR K150
June 7th.  I'm going to order you a blood pressure cuff to the house.

PATIENT K150
What is this?

DOCTOR K150
Huh?

PATIENT K150
What is it?

DOCTOR K150
What is a blood pressure cuff?  What do you mean what it is?

PATIENT K150
Yes, yes, yes.

DOCTOR K150
Oh it's similar to that but its manual.  It's automatic so you can at least keep a log of your blood pressure to try to decide on what to do.

PATIENT K150
Don’t send it.

DOCTOR K150
Okay.  Do you want to see; do you want to have like a nurse visit on the 7th when you come, have one of the nurses up here check your blood pressure?

PATIENT K150
They can't do it while they're taking blood, don't they?

DOCTOR K150
Yeah I mean they can't do it in the lab downstairs.

PATIENT K150
Oh.

DOCTOR K150
Your choice.

PATIENT K150
Yeah that's fine, fine.  For me to check my blood pressure every third day or every fifth day…

DOCTOR K150
No maybe once a week.

PATIENT K150
Once a week, just what I need, I'll get more nervous.

DOCTOR K150
@@@ June 7th, let me see.  Okay.  Now give me a couple minutes okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  179:10  DOCTOR IN:  185:04)
DOCTOR K150
Alright we're all set.  So you'll come in on June 7th to get your labs done on June 7th and then we'll go from there.  And you need to work on the smoking and keep it in the back of your mind if it's still high we'll have to start something if you want.  Okay?
 
PATIENT K150
I really tried that hard core once.

DOCTOR K150
What?

PATIENT K150
@@@.

DOCTOR K150
Well let's see when you come back.  @@@.

PATIENT K150
Why don't you just @@@ order for the patches?

DOCTOR K150
It's a start.  But starting the patch is good.  Alright I'll see you back in six months, nurse visit.

PATIENT K150
I give that to them?

DOCTOR K150
Yeah it's all yours.  Okay.

PATIENT K150
Hey thank you.

DOCTOR K150
Thank you.

PATIENT K150
You're very thorough.

DOCTOR K150
Thank you.

PATIENT K150
Check out.
