PATIENT O716
Yes.

DOCTOR O716
How you doing?

PATIENT O716
Alrighty.

DOCTOR O716
@@@.

PATIENT O716
Yep @@@.

DOCTOR O716
What's new?

PATIENT O716
Nothing much.

DOCTOR O716
You have to remember I use the best uh recording in all my patients they love it.

PATIENT O716
Oh.

DOCTOR O716
You had more records than I did.  I love it; you're kind of uh, oh look at this.

PATIENT O716
Look at this. Latest, three months of blood pressure @@@.

DOCTOR O716
Holy moly. That's great. And here are your glucoses, oh wow, they look good, 120s, 114 over 71, 113, 115.  Well your blood pressures are doing, pretty much our goal is less than 130.

PATIENT O716
Well the last times have had a couple of spikes.

DOCTOR O716
Uh, yeah what happens with blood pressure is that throughout the day.

PATIENT O716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O716
It's kind of more like this than anything else so, what's really important for us is to sort of a trend for these

PATIENT O716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O716
So I'm uh happy with your blood pressure.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
And so let's just say I checked it today and I saw a 135/80 randomly today um.  If you didn't have this log, I'd have to say ah man I wonder what.

PATIENT O716
Well, I think today it was.

DOCTOR O716
Right, yeah, so with this log I know that you know as the day changes with different levels of stress.

PATIENT O716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O716
And different levels of caffeine or you know how excited you are, your blood pressure kind of goes like this but what matters, over the long haul, is sort of the trend.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
And your trend is good.  Same with your sugars.  Um now you're taking, let's pull up your.

PATIENT O716
Yeah I have to work on the medication because we just have a part of them filled.  You were going to look at it last time and.

DOCTOR O716
@@@ filled, oh in terms of which ones were @@@.

PATIENT O716
Yeah you were going to make a decision as to what I should take and obviously may not have had a chance to do that.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah.  Well, you mean um in terms of what we could get you or maybe?

PATIENT O716
Yeah, yeah.  Cause I was on more medication before I come here and you said we could.

DOCTOR O716
What were you on when you came here?  I have here that you were on glyburide, you're taking 5 mg daily.

PATIENT O716
Correct.

DOCTOR O716
Right now.  Yeah your hemoglobin A1c last time was incredible.

PATIENT O716
How can I get copies of the reports?  Cause I'd like.

DOCTOR O716
That's why I can print one.

PATIENT O716
Alright can I and what I got tested for.  Cause you had mentioned once maybe.

DOCTOR O716
And did you get a stress test?

PATIENT O716
Yeah.

DOCTOR O716
I wonder why I didn't see the results of that.

PATIENT O716
I was supposed to, you said you might give me an HIV and uh, I forgot what the other one was and I had no idea what tests I really had.

DOCTOR O716
In May.  Good, no evidence of ischemia, so that's good.  I'm trying to remember why we.  Were you having any complaints?

PATIENT O716
Well I had an upper chest infection or something.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah.

PATIENT O716
And some pounding of the chest.  These were the medications I was on.

DOCTOR O716
Oh, historically.

PATIENT O716
Yeah.  You changed the.

DOCTOR O716
Glyburide, no yeah you were only on one medication for diabetes.

PATIENT O716
Right, right.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah but.

PATIENT O716
But I was on Flomax and finasteride.

DOCTOR O716
Oh.

PATIENT O716
And then I was also on this for high blood pressure and you said you were going to review that and uh see.

DOCTOR O716
Okay, which ones are you taking, the lisinopril one?

PATIENT O716
Well you changed yeah, no uh metoprolol.  You changed that.

DOCTOR O716
Okay.

PATIENT O716
The last visit.

DOCTOR O716
Let me see what I've got again diabetes.

PATIENT O716
You did have a half and a half.

DOCTOR O716
Let's see what I put here um.  Switched from metoprolol to lisinopril @@@.  I think we just thought your regimen was kind of bizarre.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
And the reason why we changed that was because typically if people have any sort of, if they have diabetes or if they have any sort of heart problems, uh metoprolol is sort of a really good drug for cardio protection.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
The thiazem is a is kind of a weird choice and the last time you a bad reaction to metoprolol.  So the reason why we changed it wasn't because of uh.

PATIENT O716
Right cause the other one I was on, does that mean I don't need to take that any longer?

DOCTOR O716
The verapamil?

PATIENT O716
Yeah.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah no.  Uh, we had stopped your, uh wait a minute.  We had stopped your.  You were historically on diltiazem.  Both of those were sort of calcium channel blockers um, so I think at this point you're taking, you're on lisinopril, verapamil @@@.

PATIENT O716
@@@ that I asked the doctor if he couldn't get something more in the line of @@@.

DOCTOR O716
You have verapamil but weren't you on diltiazem?

PATIENT O716
No.

DOCTOR O716
What I have on the list @@@ diltiazem.

PATIENT O716
No.

DOCTOR O716
No.

PATIENT O716
@@@ and this one.

DOCTOR O716
Well I don't know why I have your, instead of diltiazem.

PATIENT O716
Well I don't know.

DOCTOR O716
No.  Maybe.

PATIENT O716
Unless it was under a different name but I don't recognize that.

DOCTOR O716
Okay, so you're no longer taking that though.

PATIENT O716
No.

DOCTOR O716
Okay good.  Yeah I looked at it.

PATIENT O716
Instead am I taking.

DOCTOR O716
Based upon your.

PATIENT O716
Or am I taking this cause I ran out of that uh.

DOCTOR O716
The lisinopril?

PATIENT O716
Yeah.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah we'll continue the lisinopril.

PATIENT O716
Alright.

DOCTOR O716
10 mg daily.  It's good for your heart.

PATIENT O716
@@@.  Get off of this.

DOCTOR O716
No.

PATIENT O716
Just a prescription.

DOCTOR O716
Oh for a prescription okay.

PATIENT O716

DOCTOR O716
Okay.

PATIENT O716

DOCTOR O716
Let's renew, expires, expires, all of these expire in 2011.  Let me see here.

PATIENT O716
Well I've got two that are 30 days and that's a pain in the butt.

DOCTOR O716
Let's do this, let's do um, I think what you mean is and let's do 120.  You mean it's a pain in the butt because you.

PATIENT O716
Well every 30 days uh you know.

DOCTOR O716
Oh yeah.

PATIENT O716
I get it cause it takes a week and a half to get so by the time I get it I won't have to reorder.

DOCTOR O716
I'll change the dose; I mean I'll change the quantity.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
Let's see @@@.

PATIENT O716
And then yeah and then there are two of them that are 30 day supplies.

DOCTOR O716
The statin one?

PATIENT O716
Yeah.

DOCTOR O716
The statin one you have plenty of those.  Let's see about the glyburide, we can renew them.

PATIENT O716
Glyburide is a 30 day supply, or 90 day supply.

DOCTOR O716
And let me put in for the lisinopril.  You're taking 10 right?  Lisinopril here we go 10 milligrams daily.  We'll give you @@@.  Do you want them mailed to you or do you want to pick them up at the window?

PATIENT O716
Well if I could pick this one up at the window then I can renew is on the website.

DOCTOR O716
Website.

PATIENT O716
The website yeah.

DOCTOR O716
That's kind of convenient huh.

PATIENT O716
Yeah.

DOCTOR O716
Okay so that's the medications, let me go back to this list right here to make sure I.  Hemoglobin A1c what it was, let's see let's look at.  You've had two stress tests?

PATIENT O716
Right, sure.

DOCTOR O716
It looks like you had @@@.

PATIENT O716
Right, right.

DOCTOR O716
What symptoms were you having for those?

PATIENT O716
The first one they read an EKG, the doctor said the computer read the EKG.

DOCTOR O716
Okay.

PATIENT O716
And indicated I had a heart attack.

DOCTOR O716
Okay.

PATIENT O716
And it says that was totally incorrect but now that I had something that said I had a heart attack, he had to prove it's wrong.

DOCTOR O716
Okay.

PATIENT O716
And then the last one my insurance was expiring so he.

DOCTOR O716
Oh.

PATIENT O716
It's just a precaution.

DOCTOR O716
And currently you're doing well, you have no complaints?

PATIENT O716

PATIENT O716
It's been a long struggle but it's getting down there.

DOCTOR O716
That's great.

PATIENT O716
Well I felt myself gaining weight again and I knew that's not good for diabetes and everything else in the body so.

DOCTOR O716
Now remind me about your colonoscopy.  Did you have, when was the last time you had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT O716

PATIENT O716
Yes.  

DOCTOR O716

Okay.  Okay I got that done.

PATIENT O716
In fact they had a job fair here last week, I came in.

DOCTOR O716
We may repeat a urine.  In February.

PATIENT O716
February or March.

DOCTOR O716
Okay if you just had one then we'll see.  Um, they found some trace blood.  I just want to make sure there's no.

PATIENT O716
I had that before and I went through all kinds of tests and they didn't find anything.

DOCTOR O716
You did a cystoscopy?  Did they put a camera up your penis?

PATIENT O716
Yes.

DOCTOR O716
Oh they did.

PATIENT O716
Oh yeah that was fun.

DOCTOR O716
When was that?

PATIENT O716
I don’t know, I could back track, um I'm guessing maybe five, eight years ago.

DOCTOR O716
Alright.

PATIENT O716
And then I had a series of tests uh.  I had a CAT scan associated with that as well as a uh another test, I can't remember what it was.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah your HIV was negative.  Vitamin B12 was all normal and your blood was.  Yeah you have two UAs with blood.  Let's repeat one.  Well you have the results, when was the cystoscopy?  Do you remember when that was?

PATIENT O716
Uh no I think I listed it, let me see.  I'll have to check that for the next time.

DOCTOR O716
Okay.  Do you remember approximately when it was like a year ago, two years ago?

PATIENT O716
No it was probably five to eight years ago.

DOCTOR O716
I'm going to repeat a UA today okay.

PATIENT O716
What's that?

DOCTOR O716
Just urine and some blood tests.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
We'll do a pee in cup.  Okay, let's have you come over there and @@@ 166/80 we’ll check it.

PATIENT O716
Yeah.

DOCTOR O716
You go to the nurse check, that's okay.

PATIENT O716
Yep.

DOCTOR O716
The nurse check was higher um.  Have you been following all this madness with the basketball stuff, all these people speculating about Lebron James?

PATIENT O716
No.

DOCTOR O716
No.

PATIENT O716
I'm not.

DOCTOR O716
Chicago's going, they're all going crazy.

PATIENT O716
@@@.

DOCTOR O716
He's a famous basketball player, who everybody, everybody and their cousin wants to sign of course Chicago is in a frenzy on all the shows.

PATIENT O716
@@@.

DOCTOR O716
Get Michael Jordan back here but I don't know and I don't care how good you are, I don't know that there's going to be anybody as good as that guy.  He was pretty. 

PATIENT O716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O716
Pretty amazing.  Unfortunately for me, I was a Phoenix Suns fan growing up.

PATIENT O716
Oh oh.

DOCTOR O716
The Phoenix Suns never had much success against them.

PATIENT O716
Uh uh.

DOCTOR O716
Especially when they played them in the finals and lost, that was no fun.  Fun for people here but.

PATIENT O716
@@@.

DOCTOR O716
It's a little high.  Did you take your blood pressure pills today?

PATIENT O716
I take them at night.

DOCTOR O716
Do you take all of them at night?

PATIENT O716
Oh no I @@@ split them in half.

DOCTOR O716
So @@@.

PATIENT O716
What?

DOCTOR O716
Do you mean that you haven't been taking your lisinopril?

PATIENT O716
No, no.

DOCTOR O716
Okay.

PATIENT O716
@@@.

DOCTOR O716
Maybe that's the reason why your blood pressure is so high.  Maybe your, now that we restart the lisinopril it probably should come back down.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
What I would do is, that way when you get it downstairs, take it and then maybe, make sure that, maybe next week like on Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday, come in for the nurse practitioner here or just call me after.  You have a blood pressure cuff right?

PATIENT O716
Yep.

DOCTOR O716
Obviously you’re checking it and call me with the blood pressure, make sure the lisinopril is kicking in.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
How long have you not been taking the lisinopril?

PATIENT O716
Couple months probably.

DOCTOR O716
Oh that long.

PATIENT O716
Yeah.

DOCTOR O716
That long okay.

PATIENT O716
That's what I was saying, you need to address @@@.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah, definitely want to put you on that.  Okay I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT O716
Alright and then the ones that were for 30 days, are you going to change those to 90 days?

DOCTOR O716
I did.

PATIENT O716
So that was two of them?  I forgot what two.

DOCTOR O716
Um.

PATIENT O716
@@@.

DOCTOR O716
It would be lisinopril, metoprolol and the glyburide.  I gave you 120 of the metoprolol and then you have 90 of the glipizide.

PATIENT O716
Oh wait I'm only take a half, I'm taking one a day.

DOCTOR O716
Of the what?  The glyburide?

PATIENT O716
The metoprolol.

DOCTOR O716
Right.

PATIENT O716
I'm taking one pill.

DOCTOR O716
Right.

PATIENT O716
Cutting in half.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah.

PATIENT O716
Taking a half in the morning and @@@.

DOCTOR O716
Well you're taking half a pill twice a day right?

PATIENT O716
Right so I'm taking one pill a day.

DOCTOR O716
Correct.  @@@ You said that you want more than what you're getting.  You want 90 instead of 30.

PATIENT O716
Right.

DOCTOR O716
So with what we give you, you're going to have plenty.

PATIENT O716
Oh okay.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah.  Okay I'll be right back.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  27:20  DOCTOR IN:  41:41)

DOCTOR O716
Alright.  Well my attending thinks that um she's okay with checking your UA but if you have no symptoms then we'll just leave it alone.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
In terms of looking for, the last one was technically negative for red blood cells, the one before that had some in it.  So if you're not having any symptoms we'll just let it be.

PATIENT O716
Well that's what started the first time, it was high and it shouldn't have been over 3.

DOCTOR O716
Uh we will, so this one is ready for you to pick up, these two won't since you have plenty of them or we can mail them to you.

PATIENT O716
Well I'll go @@@.  Um so what am I going to pick up today?

DOCTOR O716
Lisinopril.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
And then call the nurse, call us up on like Monday or Tuesday to make sure your blood pressure really can you know, came back down uh.  Since you've been on the lisinopril.

PATIENT O716
Yeah.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah.

PATIENT O716
Well what should it read other than this?

DOCTOR O716
Well no so these ones were, I guess my point is if you recently ran out of them, these readings were.

PATIENT O716
No it was three months ago.

DOCTOR O716
Oh yeah.

PATIENT O716
Actually or more, I think it was more than two months ago.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah.  It was up, before breakfast, oh here's your blood pressure, 119, 120, 160, @@@.  Yeah for the uh diabetes you really shouldn't be on an ace inhibitor.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
Um so what I would say is just a low dose of lisinopril.

PATIENT O716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O716
Something like 10 mg daily.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
But make sure that it doesn't go, if your blood pressure goes low or you get dizzy stop taking it.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
Okay.

PATIENT O716
What about the Flomax and finasteride?

DOCTOR O716
Um.

PATIENT O716
I was on that before, I don't have any other than.

DOCTOR O716
So the way the VA works is that I think I have to put in for terazosin it's a similar one.

PATIENT O716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O716
Uh but basically we'll do like a starter pack and you slowly work your way up on that, you want that for a month.  In other words the VA, they get the terazosin.

PATIENT O716
Well I don't have any prescriptions, any remaining prescriptions from the old doctors.

DOCTOR O716
Okay.  So then why don't I do that then?

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
I'll put in for terazosin a starter pack.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
And then you'll use, it's like one pill for the first week then two pills and three pills or whatever for a month.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
But because the VA, because of the cheapness of the medication, whatever the cost is to the VA they do one that's similar but it's called terazosin.

PATIENT O716
Okay yeah.

DOCTOR O716
So I'll put that.

PATIENT O716
Alright.

DOCTOR O716
And then because you're doing so well, you don't need to see me for like six months.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
Cause you're really, you're doing real good.

PATIENT O716
Alright but then I went on uh My Healthy Vets, the online guide.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah.

PATIENT O716
There are tips for wellness.  They were talking about a diabetic eye exam.

DOCTOR O716
Okay.  Have you been to @@@.

PATIENT O716
A foot exam.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah the foot exam you don't have to go to anybody to do it.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716

PATIENT O716
And then they talked about heart attacks.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah you've got @@@.  When was the last time you saw somebody from optho@@@ though?

PATIENT O716
Uh probably three years ago.

DOCTOR O716
Okay let's do, here you had May 2000, I have the surveillance in here.

PATIENT O716
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O716
Diabetic retinopathy surveillance.  Did you make that pending.  So it looks like I ordered and maybe we just didn't set up the appointment.

PATIENT O716
I didn't know anything about it.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah so let's, let's go, when you go to the front we'll do the consults and diabetic retinopathy.  Come with me we'll set this up and.

PATIENT O716
Alright then you were going to print out the uh.

DOCTOR O716
Oh the um tests um hmm.  @@@ all one location.  What specifically do you want to know?

PATIENT O716
Well generally I get the blood test results.

DOCTOR O716
Yeah.

PATIENT O716
I got the A1c and all the blood work, cholesterols and that.

DOCTOR O716
Let's do this, these are your, you're not going to want those um.  I don't know how to put them all on one thing um.  Tell you what um, they don't show up on the web, you can't look them up on the web?

PATIENT O716
Not yet.

DOCTOR O716
Hmm.  So the problem is just kind of trying to, I don't know how to print all of the.

PATIENT O716
They give you places where you can put in the information that you have but if you don't know the results you can't get it.

DOCTOR O716
Um let's see what happens if I do labs cumulative, let's see what will happen if I print this.

PATIENT O716
Right.

DOCTOR O716
I'm going to try and print this and see if I can get this to actually work.  Okay come with me and then I'm going to see if this printed or not.  I'll be back in like 10 seconds you can have a seat right there.

PATIENT O716
Right here, okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:25  DOCTOR IN:  46:50)

DOCTOR O716
Here we go.

PATIENT O716
Oh thank you.

DOCTOR O716
Again, uh basically what it does it look like it's going to put in to, @@@ UA.

PATIENT O716
Okay.

DOCTOR O716
Here is like basically BNP, so the thing that's important here.

PATIENT O716
Does it give me a cholesterol here?

DOCTOR O716
Here this is the hemoglobin A1c, @@@.

PATIENT O716
@@@

DOCTOR O716
@@@

PATIENT O716
Oh okay.

DOCTOR O716
That's the important one.

PATIENT O716
How about the, yeah that would be affected if I was fasting right?

DOCTOR O716
No because it's a measurement of three months.

PATIENT O716
Oh three months.

DOCTOR O716
Okay and another one that's important okay.

PATIENT O716
But those should have been fasting and they weren't right so.

DOCTOR O716
Uh these ones?

PATIENT O716
Yeah.

DOCTOR O716
No I think, oh you weren't fasting when you did those?

PATIENT O716
