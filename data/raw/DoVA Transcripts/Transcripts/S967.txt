DOCTOR S967
Um some of the other things, last time we checked your urine everything looked okay, except you have a lot of sugar in it okay.

PATIENT S967
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR S967
Cause your diabetes isn't that well controlled.

DOCTOR S967
Yeah I mean.

PATIENT S967
It's really better.

DOCTOR S967
You've only been on it a couple weeks so I don't think it's time to recheck the blood tests yet okay.  Um but just so you know if we max out on pills.

PATIENT S967
@@@ gonna take the insulin.

DOCTOR S967
Yeah that's the next step.  I mean we're not to that point yet but just so you know that.

PATIENT S967

DOCTOR S967
Yeah, you know just keep eye on it for um.

PATIENT S967
Right.

DOCTOR S967
I mean they don't make everything sugar free but they make some stuff sugar free now um and that would help.  Weight loss will help with both the blood pressure.
