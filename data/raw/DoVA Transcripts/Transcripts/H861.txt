DOCTOR H861
It never completely goes away.

DOCTOR H861
Looks like you were just here about a month ago.

PATIENT H861
Yeah, same thing.  Well it is the same thing that I want to tell you about.

DOCTOR H861
Sure.

PATIENT H861
I got kind of like a virus and they've been watching it because of my condition.

DOCTOR H861
Right.

PATIENT H861
@@@ lungs.

DOCTOR H861
@@@ yeah.

PATIENT H861
I've been through a lot.

DOCTOR H861
You sure have.  So you're not @@@ at all.

PATIENT H861
I think I caught, I got wet about three weeks ago in the rain.

DOCTOR H861
Yes.

PATIENT H861
And uh I all this was gone, coughing, sneezing everything was gone and they all came back.

DOCTOR H861
Okay.

PATIENT H861
And now I hurt, I'm not hurting now.

DOCTOR H861
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H861
But when the pain starts you know in this area over here, it hurts and I have to drop a Vicodin and uh my stomach, I been having a lot of problems down in my stomach, I’ve been seen by the GI.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah.

PATIENT H861
But uh they said, it's too dangerous to be putting that scope down there.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah.

PATIENT H861
But something’s got to be done cause this stomach irritates me every day but I think I caught a virus because it's always growling.

DOCTOR H861
@@@.

PATIENT H861
Making noises.

DOCTOR H861
Alright.

PATIENT H861
And I got diarrhea and had it for two weeks.

DOCTOR H861
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H861
It's not diarrhea, diarrhea but it's not normal.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah okay.

PATIENT H861
And they got me on Maalox but I just changed from the @@@ you know my physical lung therapy.

DOCTOR H861
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H861
And they said that Maalox will give you irregular bowel movements.

DOCTOR H861
Let's do this, let’s try to go off the Maalox okay.

PATIENT H861
Oh, what do we do about the pain?

DOCTOR H861
Well Maalox, so we can do, you're on a PPI twice a day right?

PATIENT H861
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H861
Try just doing that, at least until the diarrhea subsides cause I don't know if this pain is coming from your lung @@@.

PATIENT H861
Yeah I'm gonna lose weight by having this diarrhea.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah, yeah and I think you have to pick which one's worse but I think I don't need you having diarrhea and losing a lot of weight you know.

PATIENT H861
Yeah.  I just keep up that way you know.

DOCTOR H861
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

PATIENT H861
As sick as I was @@@ and I don't want to lose it back.

DOCTOR H861
No, no, no.  So let's go off the Maalox, at least back off to every other day.

PATIENT H861
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H861
And see if that helps you at all.  Um you're taking.

PATIENT H861
I forgot, it start with a O.

DOCTOR H861
Um omeprazole.

PATIENT H861
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H861
And you're taking twice a day right?  @@@ go easy on that, that'll help protect your stomach and then the 5 of Maalox back off to twice a day.  You're not taking the @@@ or the Docusate are you?

PATIENT H861
What is that?

DOCTOR H861
There's two medications that are stool softeners, you're not taking them?

PATIENT H861
Oh no, no.

DOCTOR H861
Don’t take those @@@.  It happens a lot, in the hospital we wonder why patients have diarrhea and you look at what the medications are @@@.

PATIENT H861
No, I stopped immediately.

DOCTOR H861
Okay good, good.

PATIENT H861
Okay but uh you don't think it's a virus when it keep growling like that?

DOCTOR H861
No you know it could be a little bit of a  stomach virus but the thing is if you are having diarrhea and it's causing a little bit of virus and you're flushing all your food out of you so you're gonna have a little more like almost a hunger pain.

PATIENT H861
Oh.

DOCTOR H861
So that's where the growling could be.

PATIENT H861
Okay.

DOCTOR H861
So um I'd say back off the Maalox to every other day for now and just see if that helps the diarrhea at all okay.

PATIENT H861
I was gonna say maybe I took that infection @@@ again.

DOCTOR H861
Right.  Now as far as pain on the right, it's you know.

PATIENT H861
But they say I'll probably have that the rest of my life.

DOCTOR H861
Rest of your life yeah.

PATIENT H861
Cause I'm so tore up inside.

DOCTOR H861
And well you've had quite the experiences um.

PATIENT H861
Yeah.

DOCTOR H861
With all @@@ and everything.  I know you had part of a lung taken out.

PATIENT H861
Yeah.

DOCTOR H861
So a lot of times that sort of pain doesn't resolve you know for a long time.

PATIENT H861
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H861
Um okay.  Let's see and you saw Pulmonary um, you saw the lung doctors recently.  You've seen lung and GI um and how and then how long have you been on the oxygen.  How long have you had it with you?

PATIENT H861
Uh I think, now I'm good, I'm all good when I'm sitting down but when I'm walking.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah.

PATIENT H861
I got to have it.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah okay.  Yeah it says this right here you're saturation on room air just while sitting is 95 but you drop down into the 80s and normal is 99 to 100% and you drop down pretty low when you start walking so um yeah.  You know, unfortunately you’re going to have to haul that thing around. They couldn't give you a smaller tank so?

PATIENT H861
Well they, when I go back next month.

DOCTOR H861
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H861
They gonna put the word in.

DOCTOR H861
How many liters in one?

PATIENT H861
Huh?

DOCTOR H861
Just one liter?

PATIENT H861
Here, I can't go a long ways, from 5, to 3 to 2.

DOCTOR H861
Wow. 

PATIENT H861
Done to 1.

DOCTOR H861
Good for you.  You're heading in the right direction.

PATIENT H861
But they said I'll probably be dealing with this the rest of my life because I ran out of breath when I'm walking.

DOCTOR H861
Exactly you know.  Can you tell the difference in your @@@, do you feel better?

PATIENT H861
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah okay.

PATIENT H861
Yeah.

DOCTOR H861
Um otherwise I mean that, I know DOCTOR had gotten some lab tests.  Your cholesterol was perfect.  Colonoscopy we're not due until 2012 and then as far as your follow-up with GI @@@ stay hydrated with Gatorade, @@@, that kind of stuff.

PATIENT H861
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H861
Keep the electrolytes on you and then back off the Maalox to every other day.

PATIENT H861
Okay.

DOCTOR H861
Um blood pressure looks perfect.  Your prostate looks good as of last July, so things are looking good there.  Um any fevers or chills at home?

PATIENT H861
No.

DOCTOR H861
Okay.  And any coughing?

PATIENT H861
Yeah a little bit.

DOCTOR H861
Okay.  Um is this typical for you?  Do you normally cough?

PATIENT H861
Yeah every now and then @@@.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT H861
It's time summer's coming in now.

DOCTOR H861
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H861
The change in the weather it's affecting everybody.

DOCTOR H861
I was just gonna say it throws everybody off.  Um your diabetes is really well controlled.

PATIENT H861
Yeah oh I stay up on that.

DOCTOR H861
@@@ fantastic then the only other thing the glaucoma, do you follow with the?  Do you have glaucoma in the eyes?

PATIENT H861
Yeah.

DOCTOR H861
Do you follow with the ophthalmologist, the eye doctors?

PATIENT H861
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H861
Okay.  Just to make sure you're seeing them.

PATIENT H861
Right, uh-huh.

DOCTOR H861
It looks like you do a very good job.  You're probably one of the best patients I've seen.

PATIENT H861
Yeah I don't want to go back.

DOCTOR H861
You don't want to @@@ no.

PATIENT H861
I don't want to go backwards, uh uh, I had a rough time, the last since 2007 it's been rough.  You know a patient has to take care of themself, not the doctors; the patient himself has to take care of himself.

DOCTOR H861
I agree.  It's a team effort.

PATIENT H861
Yeah that's right.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah and that's what I walked into a patient's room the other day and I said you know what brings you in here, can't you read my damn chart, I said no and I was like well.

PATIENT H861
That's why we got a computer.

DOCTOR H861
And I just said listen I can read your chart all day but you know it's not the same as me talking to you know and he then did calm down a little bit.  @@@.  Um alright uh you look like you're doing a great job.

PATIENT H861
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H861
So let's just back-off on the, do you need any med refills or?

PATIENT H861
No I just called them in.

DOCTOR H861
Okay you called them in today.

PATIENT H861
I just called them in today.

DOCTOR H861
And you don't need to get labs and you're up-to-date on things.  Let me go run this by DOCTOR and then.  How often do you come back?  Do you come every month or do you come?

PATIENT H861
No, no he just wanted to see how I'm doing because you know I was feeling kind of bad.

DOCTOR H861
Right, right.  Well good.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT H861
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  16:57  DOCTOR IN:  20:54)

DOCTOR H861
Alright sir.  Now are you, okay, so here's what I kind of want to do.  This is sort of difficult so I wanted to send the um stool studies to make sure that there's no infection in your stool.

PATIENT H861
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H861
Um so that would mean you'd have to go over and give them a sample.  Are you actively having diarrhea right now?  You know it's not easy.  It's not like they can just take your blood you know you have to.

PATIENT H861
Well they can give me that thing.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah.

PATIENT H861
And I could bring it back.  I can do that.

DOCTOR H861
Okay.  Why don't we do that?  Why don’t we do that. It’s better than nothing.  

PATIENT H861
Yeah.

DOCTOR H861
Then we'll just make sure there's no infection in there.

PATIENT H861
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H861
Um.

PATIENT H861
Let me ask you something too.

DOCTOR H861
Sure.

PATIENT H861
I know it's from my lungs and all that I've been through but you know I feel tired all the time and I take vitamins every day too.  Is there something I could, is there a vitamin that I could take to make me feel more.

DOCTOR H861
Um awake - not so much and you know the first thing I think of when somebody says they're tired all the time is anemic you know.

PATIENT H861
I don't think I'm anemic.

DOCTOR H861
And you're not. I just look. Now the next thing I look at is do you have a thyroid problem, you know, is there something wrong with your thyroid so that would be tested.  You were just checked in October and your thyroid looks perfect so if anything you know with the oxygenation yeah.

PATIENT H861
That's it.

DOCTOR H861
And um that's probably a lot of it you know um your body uses the increased energy source to breathe.

PATIENT H861
Breathing.

DOCTOR H861
@@@.  

PATIENT H861
Something I got to deal with it I guess.

DOCTOR H861
Yes.  So you basically want me to do that, right you want to.  So we'll do three different stool studies and you bring them in unless you happens and go over there and meet you to go over them.

PATIENT H861
Right.  I @@@.  Now I do have to go over and get these from them.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT H861
You put in that now right?

DOCTOR H861
Yep I just put it in.  Um so how often do you normally, you want to come back in say two months?

PATIENT H861
Uh yeah, that’s fine @@@.

DOCTOR H861
And then you know, yeah exactly.

PATIENT H861
@@@.

DOCTOR H861
That puts you to see DOCTOR in June.  Just cause of all the stuff going on with you, a lot of times I let patients go a little longer than that but with all the stuff going on with your lungs and stuff I think you should come back in a few weeks. 

PATIENT H861
Okay.

DOCTOR H861
Otherwise I think everything's good.  We'll get your stuff ordered, got the cups and then we'll see you in a month.

PATIENT H861
Okie doke.

DOCTOR H861
Alright.

PATIENT H861
Is he all done with me in the computer?

DOCTOR H861
Yeah oh you mean.

PATIENT H861

DOCTOR H861
Yep.

PATIENT H861
They is strict over there.

DOCTOR H861
Yeah I know.

PATIENT H861
Real strict.  Take care.

DOCTOR H861
Hey one more thing though in the chart it says you are supposed to be on three liters.

PATIENT H861
No, this here?  This is gives me a migraine.

DOCTOR H861

PATIENT H861
