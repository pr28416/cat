DOCTOR L487
PATIENT?

PATIENT L487
Here.

DOCTOR L487	 
How are you?

PATIENT L487
I'm okay.  How are you?

DOCTOR L487
I'm good thank you.  Go ahead and have a seat.  

PATIENT L487
I just called on Monday so I'm glad to, so I got to see you in two days.

DOCTOR L487
Oh, nice.  Um so is there a reason that you wanted to come for a visit.

PATIENT L487
I got a wart.

DOCTOR L487
You got a wart okay.

PATIENT L487
And they said I need a referral to go to Dermatology.

DOCTOR L487
Dermatology.  Okay yeah and they'll freeze it.

PATIENT L487
Right.

DOCTOR L487
Do you get warts often or?

PATIENT L487
No that's the first one in, since I was.

DOCTOR L487
Little?

PATIENT L487
Yeah.

DOCTOR L487
Okay, Dermatology referral.

PATIENT L487
And two other follow up things that I’ll share with you because you work with doctor.

DOCTOR L487
Right.  Dermatology referral.

PATIENT L487
That's the name.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah and @@@, I'll put it in there.  @@@.  Is it painful?

PATIENT L487
Uh sometimes because it'll, right now it's all flat.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
But sometimes it'll kind of pop up you know like a mushroom and it'll get caught on thread or string or whatever.

DOCTOR L487
Oh okay.  Does it ever bleed?

PATIENT L487
Um yes.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.  When did it first appear?

PATIENT L487
Uh probably a year and a half ago.

DOCTOR L487
Wow, it's been there that long.

PATIENT L487
Yeah.  Actually they hit it once before with nitrogen, whatever.

DOCTOR L487
Oh, they did. And it came back.

PATIENT L487
Yes, well, you know it was really gone completely.  I should have, in fact that's what I'd like to do this time.

DOCTOR L487
Alright.

PATIENT L487
If they can hit it and then I would come back in like a month and don't wait that long.

DOCTOR L487
Well, they'll tell you what they think and if you need to come back you know later.  Okay so um your blood pressure was a little bit high last time but today actually it was normal okay. That’s good.

PATIENT L487
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L487
So have you been on a low salt diet or have you been eating less, did you lose weight? Or you don't know.

PATIENT L487
No honestly I really didn't change anything.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
I know that it was.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah I guess it fluctuates your blood pressure sometimes.  

PATIENT L487
It does but the last time I came in it was high.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah.

PATIENT L487
It was a real concern.

DOCTOR L487
Well we'll keep monitoring.

PATIENT L487
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L487
And @@@.  No need to start you on medications but I still recommend exercise you know uh and you know a sensible diet, low salt, low cholesterol.

PATIENT L487
Right.  Um you're gonna tell me not to eat cheeseburgers and.

DOCTOR L487
Well I'm also gonna say not do something @@@.

PATIENT L487
I don't know about that.

DOCTOR L487
Once in a while you can.

PATIENT L487
I know right.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah.  But you know portion control I think is the main thing.  Alright um how's the acid reflux?

PATIENT L487
Fine.

DOCTOR L487
Okay you're taking the medicine?

PATIENT L487
Yes.

DOCTOR L487
Good.

PATIENT L487
Every day.

DOCTOR L487
Good.

PATIENT L487
Once in a while I forget and I can tell.

DOCTOR L487
Oh really.

PATIENT L487
Later on that day I'll feel it more so the medicine definitely works.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.  And your cholesterol was done in March um.

PATIENT L487
I think the triglycerides were a little bit high.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah and uh you know you can take some over-the-counter fish oil.

PATIENT L487
I do.

DOCTOR L487
You do?

PATIENT L487
I have for years.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
I take fish oil, flax seed and primrose.

DOCTOR L487
Okay, so keep doing that.

PATIENT L487
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L487
And uh definitely limit the fat in your diet.

PATIENT L487
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L487
And we'll check it next year in March.  Oh this was March @@@ oh we'll check it sometime next year.

PATIENT L487
Okay.

DOCTOR L487
Um or the end of this year.  How's the headaches, have you been having them @@@?

PATIENT L487
Yes it's been better yeah.

DOCTOR L487
Good.

PATIENT L487
And that was like it was the same time that the blood pressure was up so I went through a month, before I came on that last visit, I had headaches every day and I believe it was related to that but you know once in a while.  You know what I think I have borderline apnea because.

DOCTOR L487
Sleep apnea.

PATIENT L487
Right.

DOCTOR L487
Have you ever taken a sleep test?  So why do you think?

PATIENT L487
Because the headache is, I mean a symptom of you know carbon dioxide so there's times where I'll wake up and I'll be so, so you know heavy, you know sleepy and that's when I have the headache so I always, I can't prove it.

DOCTOR L487
Right, right.

PATIENT L487
It's just how I feel when I wake up.

DOCTOR L487
Do you snore?

PATIENT L487
Oh I don't know.

DOCTOR L487
Okay uh do you ever wake up like gasping for air or anything?

PATIENT L487
No.

DOCTOR L487
Can you open your mouth and say ah?

PATIENT L487
Ah.

DOCTOR L487
Okay. Looks good. If it keeps happening let me know okay.

PATIENT L487
Hmm.

DOCTOR L487
Well sometimes you know people can kind of blockages in the neck and if you do have sleep apnea and the way to find that out is to do a sleep test.  

PATIENT L487
Well, let me tell you about, that was the next thing I was gonna follow up on, is that probably for ten years.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
Or more, a little more, I once in a while, you know depending on what I'm eating.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
You know it'll kind of get stuck and most of the time I can drink anything and push it out of the way.  Two years ago as I was eating chicken at lunch and it got stuck and I had to go to the ER so they knocked me out to get that.

DOCTOR L487
Oh the chicken bone or?

PATIENT L487
No, meat but they said that well you know it doesn't matter.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
They said well they see a lot of this it's because chicken is relatively dry.

DOCTOR L487
Hmm.  Had that ever happened again?

PATIENT L487
No.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
But um I'm more mindful of you know eating so I drink regularly while eating.  Um and I don't know if this is related to that but one other thing is once in a while I would get a little uh piece of food stuck in the back of my throat.  Kind of what you just did but if it's right back there I can see it so I would like stick a straw back there and kind of knock it out of the way and it usually @@@ in okay, I know about that.  But in the last six months say, even today right now, I can feel there's just like a little bit of you know, there's something right below there.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
I know you're.

DOCTOR L487
Do you ever like food gets stuck in your throat?

PATIENT L487
It doesn't get stuck where it won't pass.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.  So you feel like it's kind of hard to swallow?

PATIENT L487
No I feel like, you know I'm just sitting here you know I'm not eating and I kind of move my throat around it feels like there's a little you know food or something.

DOCTOR L487
Right, kind of staying, staying in there.

PATIENT L487
Stuck, yes.

DOCTOR L487
Hmm.

PATIENT L487
And I brush and floss you know twice a day.  I gargle probably six times a day and I make sure you know it gets all the way back there and clean it out but that's kind of a newer thing so I would.

DOCTOR L487
When did this start, the sensation of that?

PATIENT L487
Definitely more often in the last year.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
I'm more aware of it.

DOCTOR L487
Okay, okay and you never had a study or anything done right?

PATIENT L487
No.

DOCTOR L487
Okay are you a smoker?

PATIENT L487
No.

DOCTOR L487
Have you ever smoked before?

PATIENT L487
Yeah but just for a short time when I was in my 20s.

DOCTOR L487
How long?

PATIENT L487
Uh two years.

DOCTOR L487
Oh okay.  How about alcohol?

PATIENT L487
Rarely.

DOCTOR L487
Rarely okay any.

PATIENT L487
Drugs.

DOCTOR L487
Drugs or anything.

PATIENT L487
No.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
I'm too healthy to have any major problems.

DOCTOR L487
That's good, that's great okay.  Um hmm, so I mean sometimes people have a little bit of stricture here that they can feel it and sometimes can get stuck and um it is possible but then you're having this on and off right?  It's not happening all the time?

PATIENT L487
Uh well maybe because I'm more aware of it now.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.  Okay.

PATIENT L487
But.

DOCTOR L487
Alright uh I mean I could have you see you know the GI doctors to see if you have something in your esophagus or your throat.

PATIENT L487
And do they have something where they could put like a camera back there?

DOCTOR L487
Yeah.

PATIENT L487
They do.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah and see if they have anything in there that might be.

PATIENT L487
Why don't we do that?

DOCTOR L487
So um we'll probably start like an x-ray.

PATIENT L487
Hmm.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah have you drink something sort of and see what's going on in there okay.

PATIENT L487
Yeah.

DOCTOR L487
So yeah we'll do that um and you need a colonoscopy um so do you want to schedule that?

PATIENT L487
You know that I'm not real crazy about it but go ahead and tell me why I should have it.

DOCTOR L487
Alright so colonoscopy.

PATIENT L487
I know what it is.

DOCTOR L487
It is, it is the purpose of it.

PATIENT L487
Is to look for polyps, the cancer.

DOCTOR L487
Colon cancer.

PATIENT L487
Right.

DOCTOR L487
And the reason is colon cancer once you have it is a very deadly disease.  Um I've seen many people; once they get diagnosed they don't have that many years.

PATIENT L487
Okay.  You're not.

DOCTOR L487
But it's a very preventable.

PATIENT L487
Curable, preventable.

DOCTOR L487
It's not curable once you find it but preventable.  So that's what a colonoscopy is for.  You find a polyp, they're not cancer yet, you remove them and you're free of cancer but if you don’t look for them and then later on.

PATIENT L487
They're cancer.

DOCTOR L487
They find you with cancer then there is only so much you can do.  So that's why screening is important.  Um so what you do is what @@@ basically they put a camera through your rectum, go through all the length of your colon, look for any kind of polyps or any tumors.

PATIENT L487
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L487
The hardest thing is the night, the day before, you have to drink, fasting is only one part.

PATIENT L487
I know.

DOCTOR L487
You have to drink this thing called Go-LYTELY, probably about half a gallon I think and then it'll just make you run all @@@ yeah, so it'll clean your colon so that the doctor, you know the GI doctors will be able to visualize the colon.

PATIENT L487
Right.

DOCTOR L487
So that's the right thing really, you know.  You have to make sure that you're very close to the bathroom and um yeah @@@.  Um that's pretty much it yeah and then once they find something they'll remove it.

PATIENT L487
@@@.

DOCTOR L487
If they don't find anything then you don't have to take the test for another ten years.  What else do you want to know?

PATIENT L487
I'm aware of the procedure.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
The only reason that I'm reticent is because I've also heard, I believe you because you're a professional but I've also heard that the studies are not always.

DOCTOR L487
100% accurate.

PATIENT L487
Right.

DOCTOR L487
It's pretty good though.  Nothing's 100%.

PATIENT L487
Right, I know.

DOCTOR L487
Oh but.

PATIENT L487
But it definitely outweighs, the good outweighs the bad.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah I mean I've seen very sad results on people with colon cancer so that's why I recommend it and it's totally up to you um but I just don't want you to go through all the things that you, @@@ fully unnecessary if you don’t have this screening.

PATIENT L487
Well the uh, what's the other um, there's a gland or something.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
That men have.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh prostate.

PATIENT L487
Yeah the prostate.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
Maybe I'm confusing the two things.  Is the prostate exam the same as this?

DOCTOR L487
No.  Prostate exam is just kind of like a rectal exam.  Have you ever had a rectal exam?

PATIENT L487
Uh uh.

DOCTOR L487
So basically.

PATIENT L487
I mean just kind of feels around.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah, yeah you feel around the rectum and the prostate's very close to the rectum.

PATIENT L487
Right.

DOCTOR L487
And you feel for any nodules.

PATIENT L487
Right.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah.  So.

PATIENT L487
So that's a different procedure than the colonoscopy.

DOCTOR L487
Oh yeah the colonoscopy is actually a much more complicated procedure.  They will sedate you.  There's a camera that goes in all the way.

PATIENT L487
Right.

DOCTOR L487
To your colon.

PATIENT L487
Am I conscious?

DOCTOR L487
You're probably not gonna be conscious you know.  I've heard some patients say that the anesthesiologist didn't give them enough sedation and they kind of woke up which is kind of a bad experience for them.  But usually they give you sedation, they say count back from three to one and you fall asleep.

PATIENT L487
You know what, when I had this thing.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
They said that and they said you're gonna be conscious but you won't be able to do anything.  That wasn't true, I counted back and the next thing I knew they're waking me up.  I was out when they were doing.

DOCTOR L487
What?

PATIENT L487
That sounds like what I had the throat blockage, two years ago the chicken thing.

DOCTOR L487
Oh okay.

PATIENT L487
I was definitely knocked out so.  I was happy about that.

DOCTOR L487
Yep, yeah.  The procedure itself is, yeah you're gonna be asleep so I think the hard part is the night before.

PATIENT L487
The day, it's a day right, you can't you have to pass for an entire.

DOCTOR L487
Yes.

PATIENT L487
A day.

DOCTOR L487
Exactly, starting in the morning you start drinking.  Yeah that has to start early so then you can actually sleep at night and you don't have to run to the.

PATIENT L487
Right.

DOCTOR L487
Yes.  So why don't we schedule you for that.  Um, what about the flu shot?

PATIENT L487
Don't want it.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.  Did you get a bad reaction from it before?

PATIENT L487
In recent years I had to get shots, I was in the guard, the military 2007 so um that was more shots I think that I had in my life.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
And um I'm.

DOCTOR L487
Just be careful okay.  You know stay away from sick people.  I can't really, I usually recommend a flu shot but you know, if you don't want it that's fine.  Um I mean it's not fine but you have you know increased @@@.  Um is said you had the tetanus shot, do you remember when?

PATIENT L487
No not exactly but it was sometime.

DOCTOR L487
Just give approximate, three to four years ago?

PATIENT L487
Uh no, definitely before 06 so probably between 03 and 06.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.  The tetanus you get it every ten years.

PATIENT L487
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L487
So you'll probably need it in @@@@ then okay.  Um alright and that's good.

PATIENT L487
I need to share one thing with you.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah.

PATIENT L487
What's the stuff that they uh, can't think of the name of it, it's a chemical cousin to what is in anti-freeze used in a car.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
The.

DOCTOR L487
Methanol?

PATIENT L487
No the stuff that makes you go.

DOCTOR L487
Oh.

PATIENT L487
But they sell it over-the-counter.

DOCTOR L487
MiraLAX.

PATIENT L487
Yeah MiraLAX whatever and I bought that.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
Let's say like in the last three months and I didn't even, I didn't drink the whole thing or all day like this would be but I took double dose.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.  MiraLAX.

PATIENT L487
And it didn't do anything; I mean not even a movement.

DOCTOR L487
You're having constipation right?

PATIENT L487
Well I'm not totally you know but that way but it's not moving like it should and I take psyllium and fruit you know.  I have at least a medium amount of fiber daily.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh and then you also tried some MiraLAX and it didn't work.

PATIENT L487
Yeah.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
Yes.

DOCTOR L487
How often do you go?

PATIENT L487
Well once a day in the morning.

DOCTOR L487
Okay so you do go daily.

PATIENT L487
Right but it seems to me that what is you know by taking psyllium, in addition to if I'm eating beans and spinach and other things that are you know real high fiber then that should just fly out but there like today it was.

DOCTOR L487
Do you have to strain a lot?

PATIENT L487
Yah, I mean not a lot.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
But often enough.

DOCTOR L487
Is like your stool very hard?

PATIENT L487
When it's like that it is.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.  Do you drink enough water?

PATIENT L487
Yeah.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.  Have you tried like Colace?

PATIENT L487
What?

DOCTOR L487
Colace, something that softens your stools.

PATIENT L487
Uh, no.

DOCTOR L487
Would you like to give that a try?

PATIENT L487
Yeah.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
Oh the newest one that I tried is um, it begins with an S.

DOCTOR L487
Senna.

PATIENT L487
Yes.

DOCTOR L487
Yeah.

PATIENT L487
And that.

DOCTOR L487
That's a different kind yeah.

PATIENT L487
Right.

DOCTOR L487
So I'm gonna give you a stool softener which will make your stools soft so.

PATIENT L487
That's different from Ex-Lax?

DOCTOR L487
Yes so the other ones are kind of like.

PATIENT L487
Oh.

DOCTOR L487
Um.

PATIENT L487
@@@.

DOCTOR L487
Uh they kind of like stimulate your intestines to make them move so that you go.

PATIENT L487
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L487
This one it softens up your stool so you don't have to strain @@@.  It looks like you're taking the other stuff.

PATIENT L487
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L487
So why don't we um try this one since this acts in a different way and you can take it daily um and if it's still not working then you can take it twice a day okay.

PATIENT L487
Hmm, I appreciate that.  Cause I told the doc, I told DOCTOR that.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
And he kind of blew me off; he said, “Ah, don’t worry about that.”

DOCTOR L487
Yeah the only reason he said @@@.  Did you want to pick it up or do you want it to be mailed?

PATIENT L487
Uh pick it up today?

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.  Do you want to pick it up today?

PATIENT L487
Uh how does that work over there?

DOCTOR L487
You wait at the Pharmacy and you pick it up.  Either that or um they would mail it to you and it would take about a week or so.  Do you want to pick it up?

PATIENT L487
Let me pick it up because I got to go do the means test anyway so that'll give me time to go through the system.

DOCTOR L487
Alright. @@@ window @@@  And um.

PATIENT L487
Years ago you know I ate a lot of fruit but used to be if I took prune juice guaranteed, an hour later, it would just fly out.

DOCTOR L487
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L487
And that doesn't work anymore.  I'll take both prune juice and eat prunes and nothing.

DOCTOR L487
Oh, do you also take verapamil for your blood pressure?  It looks like DOCTOR gave you that last time.  You haven't been taking that?

PATIENT L487
Um I have it but I've probably taken it you know four times cause.

DOCTOR L487
Okay I'm just gonna discontinue that then.

PATIENT L487
Right.  No I just got the first one in the mail and.

DOCTOR L487
Okay.

PATIENT L487
It was a couple of times so I had a headache and I thought well maybe it's related to that.

DOCTOR L487
You got a headache?

PATIENT L487
But I'm not taking it regularly.

DOCTOR L487
Alright.  Let me take a listen to your heart.

PATIENT L487
You want me up there?

DOCTOR L487
That's fine.  Deep breaths in and out, again.  Again.  Good, they sound good.

PATIENT L487
Keep breathing?

DOCTOR L487
One more time, you can breathe normally now.  Any pain when I press here?

PATIENT L487
Uh uh.  I should get rid of it.

DOCTOR L487
Oh the belly.

PATIENT L487
No I'm okay.

DOCTOR L487
You could start working on your diet, low salt.  Any swelling?

PATIENT L487
No.

DOCTOR L487
Good, good.

PATIENT L487
@@@.

DOCTOR L487
Alright looks good.  So you can pick up your medicines today.  I'll make an appointment with Dermatology uh let me talk with DOCTOR and I'll be right back.

PATIENT L487
So Dermatology is just the desk up front?

DOCTOR L487
Well I think.

PATIENT L487
@@@.

DOCTOR L487
They should, yeah the front desk should be able to give you an appointment.  If not they'll give you like a phone number or something or they’ll direct you to where you can actually get an appointment. 

PATIENT L487

DOCTOR L487

PATIENT L487
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L487
Okay in that case the Ear, Nose and Throat doctors um I'm gonna refer you to them.

PATIENT L487
Hmm.

DOCTOR L487
They'll do a scope and see if there's anything in there.

PATIENT L487
Hmm.

DOCTOR L487
So ENT @@@, so they should be able to schedule you up front alright and then pick this up and Docusate, stool softner okay.  Start with um taking it once daily, if necessary.

PATIENT L487
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L487
And then kick it up to twice daily if it's necessary.  Drink tons of water and just keep an eye on your blood pressure.  Right now it looks good.  We’ll see how it is next time. And then for the colonoscopy they'll be contacting you to schedule you and make you an appointment.  Alright.

PATIENT L487
You know what I still have the stuff, the powder.

DOCTOR L487
