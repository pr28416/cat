DOCTOR R642
You haven't made the time yet.

PATIENT R642

It's alright okay.

PATIENT R642
@@@.

(Someone knocked on the door. Doctor spoke with person briefly)

PATIENT R642
I go there for two day or three days.  I have a follow-up appointment and they said to just walk-in.

PATIENT R642
Maybe between @@@ and 160.

Okay what do you take for your diabetes?  Is it just diet-controlled?

PATIENT R642
Nothing.  I used to take glyburide but it was so well-controlled.

DOCTOR R642
Yeah.  Okay um then I think that's it.  The only thing is um we'd like for you to go to the Psych Clinic – you can take a seat up here.  We'd like to get a goal and get established in there.  Um it looks like also that you had urine studies that were positive for drug use in the past.  Are you still using any kind of drugs?

PATIENT R642
Uh uh.

DOCTOR R642
No?  Okay.  When was your last use and what did you use?

PATIENT R642
Yeah that was cocaine.

DOCTOR R642
Cocaine.  How long ago in the last use?  Would you say?

PATIENT R642
Last @@@ when I was in the Pain Clinic.

DOCTOR R642
Oh in March.

PATIENT R642
Hmm before that.

DOCTOR R642
Oh okay so.  Yeah we have clinics that can help you with those things.  It would be through the Psych Addiction Program.

PATIENT R642
Yeah I used to be a patient in the Alcohol Treatment Program.

DOCTOR R642
Yeah so if you're interested we could send you there too okay.  When you're ready but I would like and I also have to tell you, you know no more cocaine, it’s bad for you, okay.  Anything for us?  No.  Did you get your flu shot today?

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R642
And you are smoking?

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R642
You are smoking?  How much are you smoking a day?

PATIENT R642
Probably a pack.

DOCTOR R642
How long have you been doing that for sir?

PATIENT R642
Hmm a long time.

DOCTOR R642
A long time.  Are you interested in quitting any time soon?

PATIENT R642
It's something I need to do but I don't know.

DOCTOR R642
Not ready yet?

PATIENT R642
@@@.

DOCTOR R642
The reasons why we um like patients to not be smoking is first of all it's you know bad for you.  It can cause cancer, increases your risk for every cancer, not just lung cancer. If you have any kind of cancer in your, you know your family you definitely don't want to be a smoker.  Um the longer you smoke the worse it is for you and you know there are patients that you see on oxygen with COPD, you don't want to be one of them right.  So we recommend that you stop smoking and we have cessation aids and we have a clinic that you can go to too to help you with it, stop smoking but first things first you have to be ready to quit or else it's not gonna work.

PATIENT R642
I know.

DOCTOR R642
And I want you to think hard about it and we'll talk about it next time okay.

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R642
Um if you want assistance we have the gum and the lozenges.  If you want the patch you have to go through the clinic okay.  So let me know if you're interested in any of that okay.

PATIENT R642
You got to go through them in order to.

DOCTOR R642
The Smoking Cessation Clinic.

PATIENT R642
If I did the patch?

DOCTOR R642
Yeah.

PATIENT R642
And the gum and the.

DOCTOR R642
Lozenges you can get here.

PATIENT R642
@@@

DOCTOR R642
Okay.

PATIENT R642
I'd be willing to give those a shot, give that a shot.

DOCTOR R642
What would you be willing to give a shot?

PATIENT R642
The gum and the.

DOCTOR R642
The gum.

PATIENT R642
Yeah.

DOCTOR R642
Okay you have either gum or the lozenges.  The gum you put it in your mouth, you chew it and you tuck it in the back of your mouth and then every time you get a craving you chew it again.  It's dangerous to chew the gum and smoke and if you need to smoke you just spit it out and then smoke okay.

PATIENT R642
And what about the.

DOCTOR R642
The lozenges same thing, you just suck on the lozenges.

PATIENT R642
You know the lozenges.

DOCTOR R642
You'd rather have the lozenges?  Okay I can give you some but remember no um lozenges and smoking at the same time.

PATIENT R642
@@@ want to quit @@@.

DOCTOR R642
Sure, sure.

PATIENT R642
I'm thinking about trying to um go without it and see what happens.

DOCTOR R642
Okay.  Alright @@@.  It looks like all of your labs are up-to-date, everything looks good okay.  So let me just @@@ okay.  Do you take all of your medicines, your blood pressure medicines?

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R642
Cause that's the one thing that's kind of high.  Did you take your medicines today?

PATIENT R642
Yes.

DOCTOR R642
You took the lisinopril?  Half a tablet.

PATIENT R642
Yes.

DOCTOR R642
You did or you didn't?

PATIENT R642
No I took it.

DOCTOR R642
If you didn't we could just keep you on the same medicine but if you did take it we'll have to increase it.

PATIENT R642
I took it.

DOCTOR R642
Okay.

PATIENT R642
I took it this morning.

DOCTOR R642
So I think what you would benefit from is um, are you trying to eat a low salt diet?

PATIENT R642
No.

DOCTOR R642
No okay.  Well you could try to just eat a low salt diet to see if that'll help the blood pressure but we can always increase your medicines just to help it.

PATIENT R642
It usually be.

DOCTOR R642
Pretty good.

PATIENT R642
@@@.

DOCTOR R642
Hopefully @@@.

PATIENT R642
Well I been carrying a big bag and I did a lot of walking to get here.

DOCTOR R642
Okay.  If you want let me check it again how's that, before we go ahead and increase your medicine.

PATIENT R642
Okay.  I got refills on?

DOCTOR R642
Well I can make sure before you leave I'll refill everything and I'll mail everything to your home okay.

PATIENT R642
Okay.  I need to get multivitamins.

DOCTOR R642
I can give you some.

PATIENT R642
Okay.  @@@ sinuses.

DOCTOR R642
Oh you're sinuses.  What do you normally do for your sinuses?

PATIENT R642
Uh I'm taking this @@@.

DOCTOR R642
I could just give you regular normal saline, sort of a salt spray @@@.  You're right; I think it was because you  were walking around.  No it's still high.  It was 150/90, a little lower.  

PATIENT R642
@@@ and we might have to increase it @@@.

DOCTOR R642
Does that hurt at all?

PATIENT R642
Uh uh.

DOCTOR R642
Is this okay?

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R642
Okay.  Alright I will be right back okay.

PATIENT R642
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:08  DOCTOR IN:  54:54)

DOCTOR R642
Alright sir, this is what we're gonna do.  Um I’m gonna increase your medicine, the lisinopril to 40 cause your blood pressure is still high on it uh and then the low salt diet.  We're going to check your urine today to make sure , my boss wants to make sure that we keep getting consecutive tests that are negative for cocaine.

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R642
And then um I'll give you those lozenges.  And for your pain medicines, so I know you're taking three in the morning and three at nighttime @@@ same release of the morphine.  

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R642
The thing is the prescription lasted you for three months now so uh kind of what we want to know is how much are you really taking every day um that way we can prescribe what you need.

PATIENT R642
It depends on how bad the pain is that I’m in, if it ain't too bad then I don't take it but.

DOCTOR R642
Oh I see so when they get bad you take them.

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR R642
Okay well.  @@@ down here.  So um you take it like the three in the morning and three at night when he has the pain but he doesn't have the pain he doesn't take it at all.

PATIENT R642
No I take them on a regular basis.

DOCTOR R642
Okay.

PATIENT R642
But the other one I take when the pain really bad.

DOCTOR R642
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
Sir the reason I asked is because you have um, I'm DOCTOR by the way um.

PATIENT R642
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
Back on July 29th you got enough medicine to last you 30 days where you took three in the morning and three at night.

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
But that prescription has lasted you until October now so you're not taking it every day.

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
Which I'm happy with that you're not taking it.

PATIENT R642
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
That's what I’m trying to figure out, how often you're taking it.

PATIENT R642
No, I'm still in a lot of pain right.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
But you don't take the morphine every day right, is that correct?

PATIENT R642
Yes @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
Okay how about the immediate acting? There’s a long-acting medicine and a short-acting medicine.  How often are you taking the short-acting medicine?  You're not taking that at all or?

PATIENT R642
Yeah whenever it's hurting.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
You need to help us out here.  First of all no more cocaine, that's number one off the bat.

PATIENT R642
Okay.  But I thought they brought me back to see the doctor because of the medication.  You know, ran out, it was running out and I was just holding on to the last one.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
Okay.

PATIENT R642
As long as I could and then you know the last two weeks have been.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
Three months! I mean, three months was the last time I filled that prescription.

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
So somehow you made 30 days of medicine last for three months.  You must not need medicine that much.

PATIENT R642
It wasn't hurting all that bad and then some pain really, if it ain't really severe.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
Okay.

PATIENT R642
I can do.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
How long have been doing that?  I don't want you taking morphine every day if you don't need it.

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
You got it?

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
I don't you to rely on it, you’re already using cocaine and doing cocaine, I don't want you to get addicted to this medication okay.  Got it?

PATIENT R642
Yes ma'am.  I @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
We'll go ahead and give you a prescription, the same prescription as the last time and then don’t use it if you don’t need it, okay.

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
And seriously I'm going to check @@@ if you keep having problems with cocaine, you're violating our Narcotic Treatment Program and I can't give you narcotics so please don't use cocaine.  Not only I can't give you the medicine, it's bad for your heart, it causes heart attacks. 

PATIENT R642
Uh-huh.  Well I had told them when I did it, if possible and um it came back clean.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
Okay.

PATIENT R642
It probably got about half and half.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
Okay try not to. It’s tempting @@@ to people that are @@@.

PATIENT R642
It ain't gonna be me.

Doctors talk among themselves.

SECOND DOCTOR R642
And then um you can always call if you're running low on your morphine and let me know okay.

PATIENT R642
Yeah okay.  Yeah it bothers me sometimes, I'm maybe thinking that.

FIRST DOCTOR R642
So I know, I know.

PATIENT R642
If you don't need it, you know when the pain kicks in.

FIRST DOCTOR R642
No you, definitely we will give you medicine when you need it, just call in for it but I guess I'm not even allowed to give you more than one month at a time anyway.

PATIENT R642
That's what the last one; I'm just stretching as long as I could see.

FIRST DOCTOR R642
Yeah.

PATIENT R642
Because they hadn’t give me another appointment, and send me a letter saying call me and make an appointment.  Which is retarded.  Cause they still have to send you the appointment after you make it?  Now I'm just saying @@@ you know it's a particular kind of pain might not be that bad and @@@ not necessarily that day.

FIRST DOCTOR R642
Uh-huh.

PATIENT R642

FIRST DOCTOR R642

PATIENT R642

FIRST DOCTOR R642

PATIENT R642

FIRST DOCTOR R642

FIRST DOCTOR R642
Um oh yeah it'll be the nurse here.

PATIENT R642
Only the nurse.

FIRST DOCTOR R642

PATIENT R642
I call the clinic.

FIRST DOCTOR R642
