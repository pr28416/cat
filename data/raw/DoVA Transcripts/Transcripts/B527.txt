PATIENT B527
No I'm all out.

DOCTOR B527
Oh okay.  Um how long have you been out of the omeprazole?

PATIENT B527
Oh I've been out of that one since February.

DOCTOR B527
Well that may be why uh you're having heartburn.

PATIENT B527
Yeah probably.

DOCTOR B527
So.

PATIENT B527
Yeah the only thing I've been on is the aspirin and that's it.

DOCTOR B527
Yeah.  You're not taking the Synthroid either.

PATIENT B527
No every thing’s run out, I ran out.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  Um okay.  You can always call us or call me and I can put in refills for you.  Um you know we do like to see you, you know probably at least every six months just to make sure the medications, you're on the right doses and everything.

PATIENT B527
Right, right.

DOCTOR B527
But uh some of the medications, like especially the Synthroid um you shouldn't just stop.

PATIENT B527
Yeah.

DOCTOR B527
It kind of regulates your thyroid and your thyroid can slow down and it can cause a lot of problems including it can put you in like a coma like state.

PATIENT B527
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B527
It's pretty rare but.

PATIENT B527
Well when I called in to have it refilled they said no you're done, you're done I said well you know.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.

PATIENT B527
No way of getting hold of you but its okay.

DOCTOR B527
Yeah I'm sorry about that.

PATIENT B527
It's okay.  Now what do I do here?

DOCTOR B527
Uh so basically this is just for you to read.

PATIENT B527
Right.

DOCTOR B527
And if you have a living will, power of attorney and that kind of stuff.

PATIENT B527
Yeah I got a living will.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.

PATIENT B527
I just said yes.

DOCTOR B527
Yeah the last time I saw you was last March.

PATIENT B527
Right.

DOCTOR B527
And those prescriptions expire after a year.

PATIENT B527
Right and from the other doctor.

DOCTOR B527
So you cut your hand back in February?

PATIENT B527
Yeah it was just my finger.

DOCTOR B527
How's that going?

PATIENT B527
When I cut it I think I don't they put something on there and then it just flared up and then all of a sudden it was infected.

DOCTOR B527
Doing better now?

PATIENT B527
Yeah I squeezed it and got the pus out of it and that was it.  Okay is that all they need?

DOCTOR B527
Whatever happened with the colonoscopy and the biopsies they did?  Did they ever call you back?

PATIENT B527
No. They said I’m good.  But my next one won't be for maybe another ten years they said.  @@@.

DOCTOR B527
They said next one in ten years?

PATIENT B527
About that yeah.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.

PATIENT B527
No red flags, every thing’s all good and I said okay.  That's the last time I heard from them.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  Yeah the pathology on it looks good.

PATIENT B527
Oh that's good.

DOCTOR B527
No other problems, complaints, doing well?  Nothing today?

PATIENT B527
Yeah, yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR B527
No chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT B527
No.

DOCTOR B527
A couple of deep breaths.  Breathe normal.  Open your mouth, say ah. Is your nose always kind of red like that?

PATIENT B527
Yeah.

DOCTOR B527
Okay does it ever bother you?

PATIENT B527
No, just from my hay fever you know.

DOCTOR B527
Oh okay.  Kind of looks like something we call rosacea, it's not really serious but.  What happened here?

PATIENT B527
What this scar?

DOCTOR B527
Yeah.

PATIENT B527
Oh that was way back in the 70s, I had an operation done in Oklahoma when I was kid to take a cyst out.

DOCTOR B527
Oh okay.

PATIENT B527
And then I got on a fight on the school bus, somebody busted the stitches open.

DOCTOR B527
Oh.

PATIENT B527
When they went back in and tried to repair it and then the tornado hit in Oklahoma at that time, back in the 60s and I never went back to them.

DOCTOR B527
Oh.  Lay back for me.  No problems with that ever?

PATIENT B527
No.

DOCTOR B527
Oh okay.  You said you're eating fine.

PATIENT B527
Uh-huh.  

DOCTOR B527
Okay you can sit up.  Any weight loss at home?

PATIENT B527
No.

DOCTOR B527
Bowel movements are okay?

PATIENT B527
Yeah so far.

DOCTOR B527
No more dark ones.  I saw that you were in the ER a month or two ago and thought you had dark bowel movements.

PATIENT B527
Yeah that was because of my iron I think it was.

DOCTOR B527
@@@.

PATIENT B527
Yeah and I was taking multiple vitamins and every thing’s fine.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  You still taking the iron?

PATIENT B527
Uh no.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  Are you out of it?  You're not taking it because you are out of it?

PATIENT B527
Oh no.

DOCTOR B527
@@@.

PATIENT B527
No I might have just @@@.  

DOCTOR B527
Okay.

PATIENT B527
I quit taking it.  I'm taking a multivitamin.

DOCTOR B527
Which is not as strong.

PATIENT B527
Yeah.  Which worked just as well so I was hoping to get my blood, my iron level and see how my iron is doing and my cholesterol.

DOCTOR B527
Well your blood counts are great.  They're normal. They did those when you were here in February.

PATIENT B527
Okay well that's good.

DOCTOR B527
Um.  We need to check your cholesterol today.  I'm going to check your thyroid levels.  Uh and you haven't taken the Synthroid since when?

PATIENT B527
Uh February.

DOCTOR B527
Okay you haven't taken anything since February?

PATIENT B527
No just aspirin.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.

PATIENT B527
I think I might have taken little purple pills but I take them for a blood pressure.

DOCTOR B527
What's that?

PATIENT B527
It's the purple pills, I don't know what their called but they're tablets.  They're for night.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.

PATIENT B527
I take those.  I still got a couple left.

DOCTOR B527
And you said you're walking okay.

PATIENT B527
Yeah, yeah, fine.  I don't walk really that far far, I do my little stroll.

DOCTOR B527
You walk up stairs without a problem?

PATIENT B527
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR B527
Any more urinary tract infections?

PATIENT B527
No, so far.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  And I know you were having a problem with that.

PATIENT B527
Yeah I don't know what, all of a sudden it just comes up like that and then I take the antibiotic and I'm fine.

DOCTOR B527
Where do you live sir?

PATIENT B527
I live in Oak Forest.

DOCTOR B527
Oak Forest.

PATIENT B527
Yeah down south.  About an hour away from here.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  I'm assuming you've eaten today right?

PATIENT B527
Yeah I had some Egg McMuffins earlier @@@.  Yeah I had McDonalds earlier.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.

PATIENT B527
About 10 o'clock or so.

DOCTOR B527
That's probably going to skew your cholesterol levels uh, especially McDonalds it's got a lot of cholesterol in it.

PATIENT B527
Oh.

DOCTOR B527
Uh maybe can you come back some time this week or next week and get the blood draws done in the morning before you eat?

PATIENT B527
Well I like to give that in Oak Lawn.  Cause it takes me at least an hour to get up here.

DOCTOR B527
Does it really?

PATIENT B527
Yeah.

DOCTOR B527
Is there a VA in Oak Lawn?

PATIENT B527
Yeah I can get that outpatient patient there over on 95th Street.  

DOCTOR B527
Yeah if they can do it there.  Is it through Hines?

PATIENT B527
Yeah.  They can draw blood there.

DOCTOR B527
Okay that's fine then.  Yeah if I put the order in here then they should be able to get it.

PATIENT B527
They should get it there and I can get.

DOCTOR B527
All I want to check is just your cholesterol levels and your thyroid, make sure your thyroid is doing okay because you haven't taken the thyroid pill since February.  Okay, otherwise are you feeling good?

PATIENT B527
Yeah I'm feeling alright.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  Let me be right back.

PATIENT B527
Yeah I can't any more time off of work right now.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  Yeah go to Oak Lawn @@@ that's fine.

PATIENT B527
Yeah if I can get in, I just call them and you know they usually draw my blood.

DOCTOR B527
Where you working, remind me?

PATIENT B527
Oh BBC Passengers over there in Alsip.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  @@@.  Stay tuned and I'll be right back with you.

PATIENT B527
Oh okay alright.

DOCTOR B527
I'll drop this off while I'm out.

PATIENT B527
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  105.0  DOCTOR IN:  109:40)

DOCTOR B527
Uh so I want to check your blood today before um we start any, specifically the Synthroid, um the thyroid medication.  Just to see how your thyroid level is doing.  Um we'll check that.  It should be back to me by the end of the week and I can give you a call and tell you if you need to restart it or not.  Um we should restart probably all the other stuff, at least the cholesterol medications um.  Do you check your blood pressures at home?

PATIENT B527
No.

DOCTOR B527
No.  Can you get a blood pressure medication and check it at home?

PATIENT B527
Uh they just took my blood pressure and it was 138/75.

DOCTOR B527
Yeah it was good, 138/72 um which is good.  What I'm wondering is that's pretty good but your blood pressure can change.  Uh you're on some blood pressure medications at home.

PATIENT B527
Hmm.

DOCTOR B527
And I'm wondering if we need to keep you on them or not.  That's why it's important you know it's important to get you here every couple of months so we can check your blood pressure.

PATIENT B527
Right.

DOCTOR B527
I don't want to have you on blood pressure medications that you don't need.  At the same time I don't want to stop the blood pressure medications cause your blood pressure looks good today and then find out that you normally run 165 at home or something like that.

PATIENT B527
Right, right.

DOCTOR B527
So I think it would be best, it'd be best for you, to be honest, if you got a blood pressure cuff and was checking your blood pressure regularly at home.  For the sole reason that if you don't need to be on medication that you're taking, one less medication you have to take.  That's one less hassle you have to deal with.

PATIENT B527
Yeah I don't have one of those machines.

DOCTOR B527
So you can get them um at Walgreen’s.

PATIENT B527
Walgreen’s right.

DOCTOR B527
Walgreen’s or CVS and they cost from what I hear generally $20-$25 for one that works fine.

PATIENT B527
Right.

DOCTOR B527
If you don't want to buy one you can go into any CVS and they have them that you can check your blood pressure there but that means you have to be going to the CVS all the time.

PATIENT B527
Alright.

DOCTOR B527
Um but uh from what people that have got them have told me they cost about $20-$25.

PATIENT B527
Yeah.

DOCTOR B527
Um the other thing uh is it an issue getting here um, being from Oak Lawn.  Is that why you don't come often?

PATIENT B527
No Oak Forest.

DOCTOR B527
Oak Forest.

PATIENT B527
Yeah I mean it takes me at least an hour, especially at this time, there's rush hour.

DOCTOR B527
Yeah.  No I understand.  The thing is with the stuff you're on, with the medications you're on and the medical issues you have we'd really like to be seeing you every three months or so.

PATIENT B527
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B527
Um if that's not possible uh we need you to get up here every three months, uh there is the Oak Lawn Clinic.

PATIENT B527
Right.

DOCTOR B527
I just asked my attending about it and he said that if you get the number for them, I can't get you an appointment there or anything but um they can give you the number.  I'm not saying, we'd love to still treat you here, you know I'd love to have you come here every three months.

PATIENT B527
Yeah.

DOCTOR B527
But if that's not possible I'd much rather have you seen every three months than once every 15 months and your medications run out and you're not taking your medications for three months and.

PATIENT B527
Right.

DOCTOR B527
You know we're coming in and we're trying to chase our tail with everything else.  If it's going to be easier for you to get into that clinic um, for your own good I think its better that.

PATIENT B527
Yeah it only takes me about 15-20 minutes to get there.  I'm usually in and out of there anyway.

DOCTOR B527
But it's up to you.  Like I say.

PATIENT B527
I got the numbers at home.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  

PATIENT B527
I got them in my.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  I'd keep all your appointments here until you make an appointment there cause like I said we can't make an appointment there.

PATIENT B527
I know they got doctors here, you know they could schedule me or whatever and I could get that to work and they'd put that in my files so you know.

DOCTOR B527
Yeah.  But you really should be seeing someone every three months or so.

PATIENT B527
Yeah.

DOCTOR B527
Cause you're on, as you know you're on a bunch of medications.

PATIENT B527
Right, right.

DOCTOR B527
And we need to make sure we have you on the right doses that we don't have you on too much medication or too little.  Um seeing you every 15 months it's only going to hurt you.

PATIENT B527
Right, right.

DOCTOR B527
Um and while we'd love to keep you here, I'd much rather you actually see someone regularly.

PATIENT B527
Right.

DOCTOR B527
So it may be an option for you.

PATIENT B527
Right.

DOCTOR B527
Um but if you don't mind we'll check the labs today and I'll give you a call later in the week and let you know uh about the Synthroid.

PATIENT B527
Hmm.

DOCTOR B527
I'll put through for the other medications okay.

PATIENT B527
Yeah.  So I got to go back down and get the blood tests?

DOCTOR B527
Yeah.  Yeah sorry.

PATIENT B527
That's alright, that's what happens I guess.

DOCTOR B527
Um yeah just get it done today because you said you can't make it later in the week right?

PATIENT B527
No it's just too hard.  I mean I'm taking off of work now but that's cause I got your appointment.

DOCTOR B527
When do you work, what shift do you work?

PATIENT B527
I work the day shift.

DOCTOR B527
Day shift.

PATIENT B527
I work from 7 to 3.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.

PATIENT B527
7 to 3:30 yeah.

DOCTOR B527
If you can make it to the Oak Lawn Clinic this week sometime that would be fine too but I want to know whether we need to restart your thyroid medication and I'd like to let you know this week.

PATIENT B527
Yeah.

DOCTOR B527
So it's up to you.

PATIENT B527
I can stop there afterwards because I've already eaten.

DOCTOR B527
Yeah okay.  Yeah if you can get it done today that's fine too.

PATIENT B527
As long as they can do it now, I'll go downstairs and they're quick.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  Any other questions or anything?

PATIENT B527
No, no.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.  As far as the reflux that you're saying you're having.  I think if you get restarted on the omeprazole that'll help.  That's why we had you on it.

PATIENT B527
Yeah.

DOCTOR B527
For the reflux.  So probably stopping that is what made the reflux get worse.

PATIENT B527
Huh it just happens you know what I mean.  @@@.

DOCTOR B527
Yeah.

PATIENT B527
Just thought it was because of the food I was eating.

DOCTOR B527
Yeah and there are things that make it worse and I'm sure you get told this, you know anything spicy.

PATIENT B527
Oh yeah.  I knew that or coffee.  I always do coffee in the morning.

DOCTOR B527
Coffee, alcohol.

PATIENT B527
Oh if I do that.

DOCTOR B527
Smoking makes it worse.

PATIENT B527
Oh I don't smoke anymore.

DOCTOR B527
So those are just things to watch out for.

PATIENT B527
Right but I try to take it easy you know.  I just take some Tums or something.  

DOCTOR B527
Yeah don't take too many though.

PATIENT B527
No, hopefully.

DOCTOR B527
You can actually run into a problem eating too many of those.

PATIENT B527
Right.

DOCTOR B527
Good seeing you.

PATIENT B527
Okay.

DOCTOR B527
I'll give you a call.

PATIENT B527
@@@.

DOCTOR B527
You give them to them when you sign out, they'll make an appointment for you.  Keep the appointments until; if you're going to switch to the Oak Park Clinic keep these until you actually get an appointment there.  There's sometimes a waiting list so you can keep seeing us until they get you in.

PATIENT B527
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR B527
Okay.

PATIENT B527
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR B527
Alright.

PATIENT B527
@@@.  Thank you now.

DOCTOR B527
Okay and I'll give you a call at the end of the week.

PATIENT B527
Okay.

DOCTOR B527
I'll see you again.

PATIENT B527
Alright.
