PATIENT Z221
Yeah.  Now what are you gonna do about me going to the bathroom so much?

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah, did you start that medication?

PATIENT Z221
What medication?

DOCTOR Z221
Oh we were gonna talk about trying a medication.  I see, we're gonna try some medication.

PATIENT Z221
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah.  You know it's a good thing because your blood pressure's high.  This medication actually lowers blood pressure so you know.  Uh, so you haven't been on anything like that before uh, so let's see hold on a sec.

PATIENT Z221
I got a list of my medicines at the base, it look like an awful lot of medicine I'm on.

DOCTOR Z221
Unfortunately you do need them.

PATIENT Z221
I got a notice also that I only got two refills on some of them too see.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah I can refill all this stuff.  Ah here we go, let's start with the peeing problems.  What's the, uh how many times a day are you going to the bathroom?

PATIENT Z221
Quite a few.  I can't even remember.

DOCTOR Z221
5, 6, 7, 8, 9?

PATIENT Z221
Somewhere in that neighborhood.

DOCTOR Z221
So it's raised.

PATIENT Z221
Well, like today for instance, I think I've been about six or seven times already.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah.

PATIENT Z221
You know and the day's only got started cause, I got till about 9 or 10 o'clock tonight.

DOCTOR Z221
You maybe go 10 times a day?

PATIENT Z221
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z221
Got it.

PATIENT Z221
Plus.

DOCTOR Z221
So how many times in the night do you wake up to go to the bathroom?

PATIENT Z221
Anywhere from 3-4 times a night.

DOCTOR Z221
Okay.

PATIENT Z221
Three to five times a night really.

DOCTOR Z221
Okay and uh, this didn't come about all of a sudden; it's been kind of gradual?

PATIENT Z221
Well, most of the time it comes out right away you know.

DOCTOR Z221
I mean, I mean, this problem itself.  It's been coming on for a while or?

PATIENT Z221
I believe it has.

DOCTOR Z221
Okay, okay.

PATIENT Z221
Every time I come to see you I actually forget.

DOCTOR Z221
Oh.

PATIENT Z221
Until I get back in the cold and then I think about it when I go to the bathroom, I supposed to tell him about that.

DOCTOR Z221
Do you ever feel like your, your stream is a little bit weaker than usual?

PATIENT Z221
Yes.

DOCTOR Z221
Ah and do you ever feel like you don't get everything out, like you could go to the bathroom again like an hour later sometimes sooner?

PATIENT Z221
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR Z221
Okay.  Alright um and then um, any blood in your urine?

PATIENT Z221
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR Z221
Discharge or irritation, nothing.  Alright.  Well it sounds like you have an enlarged prostate um and uh basically what we can do for that, so basically your prostate is kind of, looks like this and its uh with time everybody's prostate gets a little bit larger.

PATIENT Z221
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z221
Um as you age you kind of, if grows larger and larger and at some point it can cause a little bit of obstruction of your urine stream uh because @@@ you know your urethra and all that stuff so, so it can actually cause you to have urinary retention so you know.  So basically your just not emptying your bladder all the way out so, you're going to the bathroom more frequently.

PATIENT Z221
Okay.

DOCTOR Z221
So.

PATIENT Z221
And with these water pills, when I take these water pills, 30 minutes later I have to go to the bathroom and I go every ten minutes.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah.

PATIENT Z221
For some reason, for about oh, that'll last about hour and a half to two and a half hours.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah.  Then you said this even happens when you're not taking the water pill.

PATIENT Z221
Exactly.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah, so I mean a lot of pills themselves, they will make you urinate uh but only for the six hours once you take it.   With you on the furosemide, that one only acts for like six hours long so, so, you know, you might be more urination you know right after you take the pill if it was just due to that but it's still happening even beyond that.

PATIENT Z221
Yes.

DOCTOR Z221
@@@.

PATIENT Z221
Definitely is.

DOCTOR Z221
Um, alright.  So we can start you on medication.

PATIENT Z221
Well when will I get this medication?

DOCTOR Z221
Right here, you can pick it up today if you want.  I'll order it right now.

PATIENT Z221
Order it right now so that it'll be ready so when I get downstairs.

DOCTOR Z221
Oh I can do that.  I'll tell them to get to go quick, uh.

PATIENT Z221
Do I need to take this at night or morning?

DOCTOR Z221
Uh so you can take it at bedtime.  Cause it can make you, it can cause you to have a little bit of dizziness sometimes, especially like when you're standing up, so I would take it at bedtime, probably be the best time to take it.  Um the way that they do do it um, they kind of titrate it up.  They have a starter pack, which is just like comes just like I don't know 1 mg, 2 mg and 5 mg pills or something.

PATIENT Z221
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z221
And there'll be instructions on the starter pack that you states you can't run backwards, you might take 1 mg for a week then 2 mg for another week and then take the 5 and at the end of that month um @@@ if you have any problems with the medication just call and leave us a message um and I'll, uh you know we can try other medications.

PATIENT Z221
Okay.

DOCTOR Z221
Usually people are fine with it but sometimes it does give people problems.

PATIENT Z221
Alright good enough.

DOCTOR Z221
Alright so and then we'll see what we want to do after that.  We'll probably put you on the 5 mg dose after you're on the starter pack okay.  I'll order that for you to pick up now, I'll write this down alright.  Anything you're running out of right now that you want something filled?

PATIENT Z221
No not that I can think of.  Well I got the list right here; it tells you how many refills I got left on it and everything.  They just gave me this one a few minutes ago.  Two refills, and on this one I got nine refills and um I got one refill on this, you can take a look at that.

DOCTOR Z221
I got it here too?

PATIENT Z221
Oh you do?

DOCTOR Z221
I didn't know if you want me to tell them to give you a prescription right now, I could just write you @@@.

PATIENT Z221
Two refills, two refills, one, one, one.

DOCTOR Z221
How about, okay so that's the prostate um and then I should do a prostate exam on you too, unless you have a serious objection to that.

PATIENT Z221
What you got to do first of all.

DOCTOR Z221
Put a finger in.

PATIENT Z221
Up my butt?

DOCTOR Z221
Your butt yep.

PATIENT Z221
Yeah I do have a serious [objection](laughter), you want me to be honest.

DOCTOR Z221
If you don't want to do it that's okay.

PATIENT Z221
Yeah, I do have a serious.

DOCTOR Z221
Thatâ€™s okay.

PATIENT Z221
I always.

DOCTOR Z221
We can just start the medication and see @@@.

PATIENT Z221
I always think that something should come out of there and not go in there (laughter).

DOCTOR Z221
Alright that's fine.

PATIENT Z221
I appreciate that you know.  Maybe the next time if it don't work, this don't work then I'll, I'll be, you want that, I'll say hey doctor whatever you thinks.

DOCTOR Z221
Alright and then uh, here's your hemoglobin A1c levels alright so 8.1% is the most recent one uh.  This one we did back last year, it was a little bit better, it was down to 7.1% at one point then it started going up and I think I talked to you about that, if you tried to improve the diet a little bit.

PATIENT Z221
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z221
It's a little bit better than 8.1%.  Still not where we want it though.  We want it below 7% really.

PATIENT Z221
Want it below 7?

DOCTOR Z221
Uh-huh, yeah.

PATIENT Z221
Alright.

DOCTOR Z221
So this isn't absolutely horrible but it's higher than we'd like.

PATIENT Z221
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z221
Uh and the rest of your blood work, let's see here, cholesterol you're cholesterol is not so good.

PATIENT Z221
You know you took me off the cholesterol pills.

DOCTOR Z221
Oh because you had the, the problem with the muscle pain.

PATIENT Z221
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z221
Did the muscle pains ever get better or no?

PATIENT Z221
Well I, I don't have much of uh cramps and stuff.

DOCTOR Z221
Really.

PATIENT Z221
@@@ and I don't cramp up as much as I used to.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah.

PATIENT Z221
I mean I still cramp but nothing like I was cause it look like every day I could be laying in the bed and I could move a certain way and I get a cramp in my leg.  I'd be getting out the bed or something and get a cramp someplace you know and it was awful.  Then some of them cramps they last for two or three days, some of them, especially.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah so I got figure out what I want to do with your cholesterol med.

PATIENT Z221
I still got those cholesterol, cause I got some of those.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah cause I'd like you to be on the cholesterol pill and I don't think, I don't think that's giving you the problem with the cramping though.  It can do that but I don't think it was doing it.  What do you feel?

PATIENT Z221
Well and since I've been off of them, I don't, like I said I don't cramp as much.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah.

PATIENT Z221
I don't cramp as much.  I mean I used to, I could really, I told my wife I just move, look I could be sleeping, turn over and get the cramp, I say oh my God.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah.

PATIENT Z221
I'd have to get out the bed and stand on the side of the bed for hours.

DOCTOR Z221
Hmm.  And does anybody um, anybody in your family ever have any weird muscle problems or anything like that that you know of?

PATIENT Z221
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR Z221
Okay.  Um.  Do you get any morning sickness like, with your muscles and joints, do you feel, do you feel like that's really an issue or not really?

PATIENT Z221
It's not an issue.  I don't think it's an issue you know.

DOCTOR Z221
And um and when you don't have those cramps do you have problems with pains in your muscles really.

PATIENT Z221
Well my muscles get tight a lot now because lately I've been doing a lot of exercise so.

DOCTOR Z221
Uh what kind, what do you do?

PATIENT Z221
I do, like this you know, trying to bring the stomach here, some crunches and I.

DOCTOR Z221
Do you lift weights?

PATIENT Z221
And I, no, no don't lift any weights.

DOCTOR Z221
Alright and you don't have problems like combing your hair or doing . . .

PATIENT Z221
No.

DOCTOR Z221
No, nothing like that alright.  Sometimes we can try like uh, some cholesterol medication that's not as strong to, that's the other alternative uh.  I think we'll, I think first we'll just deal with this prostate and your blood sugar.  So what do you, are you checking your blood sugars?  You're supposed to bring your log because you know the thing is your blood sugars, they're not, it's not even difficult to really control.  All you really need to do, you're already on insulin I just gotta figure out how much to increase your insulin so that can be controlled, that's the thing.

PATIENT Z221
Well see I'm trying to exercise and diet, where I can come off the insulin some you know, so it can be decreased so that's what I'm hoping.

DOCTOR Z221
Uh we'll see.  So what, well how much insulin are you taking right now?

PATIENT Z221
Okay, I'm taking 20 in the morning and 15 at night.

DOCTOR Z221
20 in the morning, 15 at night okay and when was the last time you checked the blood sugars?

PATIENT Z221
Oh it's been about a month and a half now.

DOCTOR Z221
Really, wow.  And you never feel like your blood sugar is low or anything like that?

PATIENT Z221
Oh sometime I get a headache or something but I, I chalk that up to not eating and stuff like that.

DOCTOR Z221
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z221
You know.

DOCTOR Z221
Does your wife know you don't check your blood sugar?

PATIENT Z221
Don't tell her either (laughter).

DOCTOR Z221
Can you get her to check your blood sugar?

PATIENT Z221
(Laughter).

DOCTOR Z221
I'm serious.

PATIENT Z221
Uh I'm gonna start doing it.  I'll start doing it myself you know.

DOCTOR Z221
Cause I can tell you right now, you'll, you'll never be off of insulin.  You're taking 30,000 units of insulin a day, that's a pretty substantial amount.

PATIENT Z221
I know.

DOCTOR Z221
And it's not, it's really, in terms of your health it makes no difference if you're taking 30 units or 40 units, you might in the @@@ that it's controlling your blood sugars, that's the thing is chloride so.  I mean we have patients that are on almost 200 units of insulin.

PATIENT Z221
I know.

DOCTOR Z221
You're not going to have that, but it does.

PATIENT Z221
I hope not.

DOCTOR Z221
Doesn't really matter how much insulin you're on, the key is that your blood sugars are under control.  Insulin's just a normal substance produced by your pancreas.

PATIENT Z221
Okay.

DOCTOR Z221
So it's not like we're giving you anything abnormal.  It's just, when you have diabetes you know, the insulin, you have problems making it when your pancreas, and all and your cells have problems using the insulin and you usually require more insulin as a diabetic.

PATIENT Z221
Okay.

DOCTOR Z221
So, when you don't know what it is um.

PATIENT Z221
Can't you.

DOCTOR Z221
What I can do.

PATIENT Z221
Now, well I got a question.

DOCTOR Z221
Yep, uh-huh.

PATIENT Z221
Um, um, DOCTOR, oh what was her name, DOCTOR, she used to work here.

DOCTOR Z221
Yes she was in Endocrinology.

PATIENT Z221
Anyway, she was my doctor before.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah.

PATIENT Z221
At one time and she would send me to the Lab and she could tell me what my blood sugar was really fast.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah, that's what a hemoglobin A1c.

PATIENT Z221
That's what I thought it was you know.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah, it's.

PATIENT Z221
It's coming down.

DOCTOR Z221
It's not a substitute for checking your blood sugars.

PATIENT Z221
It's, its coming down but that's.

DOCTOR Z221
So your hemoglobin A1c is 8.1%, so that means.

PATIENT Z221
It was 8.5 though.

DOCTOR Z221
So what that means is your blood sugars on average are running about 205, 210.  That's what your blood sugars are running if you would actually check it, you're probably gonna get somewhere in the high 100s, low 200.

PATIENT Z221
I got, what time would you like for me to check it approximately?

DOCTOR Z221
So I would uh check it before breakfast, before you eat anything.

PATIENT Z221
Before I eat anything.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah.  And then I would start with that, at least we'll the basic, what you need to do.

PATIENT Z221
Okay, okay, I'll check it.

DOCTOR Z221
You don't even have to do it every single day.  If you did it like once or twice a week I would be happy with that.

PATIENT Z221
You got it.

DOCTOR Z221
But, what I do what you to do is increase your insulin to 20 units in the morning and 20 units at night.

PATIENT Z221
20 and 20?

DOCTOR Z221
Yes.

PATIENT Z221
That means I'm they're gonna to send me more insulin.

DOCTOR Z221
That's fine I can change it okay?

PATIENT Z221
Alright.

DOCTOR Z221
Alright.  And your blood sugars will get better cause again the amount of insulin you're still doesn't really matter, how high your blood sugars are that's what's the matter and you don't know how high they are if you're not checking them.  That's really the key.

PATIENT Z221
Alright and I know you've told me to do it a couple of times and I.

DOCTOR Z221
I did.

PATIENT Z221
Yeah.  Alright you got me.

DOCTOR Z221
Alright.

PATIENT Z221
Anything I need that I'm not doing that I should be doing?

DOCTOR Z221
Uh that's, really those are the main things alright.  I mean that's the thing that is going to save your life in the long run.

PATIENT Z221
Alright.

DOCTOR Z221
Save your feet from getting amputated and you know losing vision in your eyes, save you from having, or you have some pains in your legs but you know if you get a little bit better.

PATIENT Z221
Neuropathy is a problem.

DOCTOR Z221
Neuropathy and all that stuff gets better with better blood control, blood sugar control.

PATIENT Z221
Okay.

DOCTOR Z221
So work on that uh.  Let's get you up here.  Let have you step forward.  

PATIENT Z221
(Laughter)  Alright, what's up, where your mitts?


DOCTOR Z221
Lungs sound good.  Deep breath.  Let's hear that again.  And how old are you now?

PATIENT Z221
63.

DOCTOR Z221
63 alright.  @@@.  Uh how's the smoking going?

PATIENT Z221
Smoking?

DOCTOR Z221
No, you don't smoke okay.  That's cool.

PATIENT Z221
(Laughter).  I did smoke a cigar though.

DOCTOR Z221
Oh every once in a while.  @@@.

PATIENT Z221
(Laughter).  I quit smoking when they went up to a dollar.

DOCTOR Z221
Good, when was that?

PATIENT Z221
I don't even remember it's been so long ago.  They tell me cigarettes $8 a pack now.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah.  Should be motivation for anybody right?

PATIENT Z221
Yeah.  I told my wife you need to quit smoking.

DOCTOR Z221
Right.  Hey good news is your blood pressure is pretty good, better than it was when we checked it, 124/62, good.

PATIENT Z221
I know my blood pressure shouldn't be that bad.

DOCTOR Z221
Yeah @@@ you're walking around, you know what's going on but.  I like that number.

PATIENT Z221
I do too.  Yeah I told her when we move into the new house, no smoking within 45 feet of the house.

DOCTOR Z221
That's right, that's what you need, you gotta lay down the law.

PATIENT Z221
And there's no smoking in my car or my truck.

DOCTOR Z221
That ain't bad, that's exactly what you gotta do, you know to be.  You know when they started, I think that's actually been pretty helpful is, as much as people hate the smoking ban and stuff and you know and this must be kind of, sometimes it's the government overstepping their bounds.

PATIENT Z221
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z221
So you know, I think it's a real good thing.

PATIENT Z221
In the long run.  No I don't have any swelling, no swelling.

DOCTOR Z221
Even if, even if you did smoke, I think it's a good thing.

PATIENT Z221
I check my feet every day, I don't have any swelling.

DOCTOR Z221
Okay.  Alright.  Let me see what we have here in detail.  And your muscles hurt right now?

PATIENT Z221
No, they're pretty good right now, no.  I haven't did anything I guess.

DOCTOR Z221
And any recent sickness or colds or anything like that?

PATIENT Z221
No thank God and I hope I don't get any.

DOCTOR Z221
Alright.  I'll be right back okay?


PATIENT Z221
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT: 31:13  DOCTOR IN:  35:39)

DOCTOR Z221
Alright.  Now we'll, I'll just have them make all those changes where's that medication list you had?

PATIENT Z221
Oh right here.

DOCTOR Z221
I'll just it on this so you remember and the other thing, you know I don't know why you had those cramping things and you know you're muscle enzyme levels are just a little bit elevated.  Again I don't know why, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you to the rheumatologist to see you, to see if they have any other ideas of why that might be because we took you off of the cholesterol pill.

PATIENT Z221
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z221
Uh thinking that that might be causing the problem.

PATIENT Z221
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z221
But the last blood test you had, your muscle enzyme level still is a little bit elevated so.  Again I don't know why that is.  I mean it doesn't sound like anything else is going on cause you're pretty healthy you know.

PATIENT Z221
I.

DOCTOR Z221
You can get some weird diseases that make you weak, but you know, you're pretty young and strong so.  At least you look young and strong right?

PATIENT Z221
Oh yeah, looks are deceiving someone.

DOCTOR Z221
(Laughter).  Um, you know all the kind of @@@.  Twice a day, 20 units, 20 units in the morning, 20 units, what time do you take it at night, before dinner?

PATIENT Z221
It varies.

DOCTOR Z221
That's when you should take it.

PATIENT Z221
It varies.

DOCTOR Z221
Okay just take it before dinner.

PATIENT Z221
Alright.  Maybe that's what I'm not doing.  I'm not taking it at the right time you know.

DOCTOR Z221
Okay.  Uh I'll see you back in three months.  We'll repeat your labs at that time.  This is December.

PATIENT Z221
8th, its December the 8th now.

DOCTOR Z221
We'll check your labs in a month, how about that?

PATIENT Z221
Okay.

DOCTOR Z221
A month for your labs.  We can see with you checking your blood sugars and increasing that insulin if that brings down your hemoglobin A1c. okay.

PATIENT Z221
Okay.

DOCTOR Z221
And then the Rheumatology, they'll call you and schedule an appointment at some point and then uh.

PATIENT Z221
It'll be soon though, probably this month.

DOCTOR Z221
