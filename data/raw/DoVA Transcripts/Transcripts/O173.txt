DOCTOR O173
I heard all about that.

PATIENT O173
I spent three or four days here. 

DOCTOR O173

PATIENT O173
Twice I had surgery, December 1st.

I had the original and then in July was the big one.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.  So uh how old are you now?

Advanced directives.

DOCTOR O173
Exactly.  So you're gonna be due for some labs.

PATIENT O173
Well uh I went to that class, when was that, sometime last May, the Diabetes Class.

DOCTOR O173

PATIENT O173
It was like three or four hours here.  

DOCTOR O173
Yes.

PATIENT O173
And uh they give me one of those glucose meters and.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.

PATIENT O173
Well I get.

DOCTOR O173
Have you been checking your sugars?

PATIENT O173
This past week I ran out of the strips and before that.

DOCTOR O173
You need more?

PATIENT O173
Uh yeah.  Yeah I called to refill the script and they said it was beyond expiration.  That was just a sampling on there from the past week the dates.

DOCTOR O173
Okay.

PATIENT O173
Sunday I've run out but all the other things are on there I guess in the memory.  It goes back for the last May or whatever.  We got a time and a date on there.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.  So they're probably a little higher than we would like.  You know there are quite a few that are in the 200s.

PATIENT O173
Well from what I remember they said if it's over 500 to call the doctor right away or if it's below 100.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.  Well.

PATIENT O173
If it's somewhere in between 200 and right.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah right.  Um okay, this says you're on @@@.  And when was the last time you saw an eye doctor?

PATIENT O173
About probably a year ago.

DOCTOR O173
So we'll get you back in to get a look at that.  We'll recheck your cholesterol.  Uh we'll check, we'll recall your hemoglobin A1c which gives us an idea of more uh, an average of what your blood sugar has been.

PATIENT O173
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O173
Rather than just what it is at that moment.

PATIENT O173
Oh okay yeah.

DOCTOR O173
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT O173
Cause it changes constantly, if you have something to eat it's probably different in ten minutes.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah, this gives us an average.

PATIENT O173
Oh okay.

DOCTOR O173
Over the past about 90 days.

PATIENT O173
Huh okay.

DOCTOR O173
Um okay.  And then your blood pressure was up today huh?  Has it been up?

PATIENT O173
The what?

DOCTOR O173
Your blood pressure.

PATIENT O173
Oh it was just 158 over 80.

DOCTOR O173
Do you check it at home and outside the hospital?

PATIENT O173
When I check it at home, maybe three, four days ago, it was 136/80.

DOCTOR O173
Do you take any water pills, anything besides the metoprolol?

PATIENT O173
Uh.

DOCTOR O173
Hydrochlorothiazide.

PATIENT O173
That one I got a rash from.

DOCTOR O173

PATIENT O173
Uh I'm taking something else, what is it?

DOCTOR O173
Furosemide, Lasix, lisinopril?

PATIENT O173
No simvastatin what is that for?

DOCTOR O173

DOCTOR O173
That's alright, thanks for bearing with us here.  It's difficult.  Can you sit up here?

PATIENT O173
Sure.

DOCTOR O173
I read all your chart on Friday and that was one thing I'm trying to think back and remember everything.  I can't refresh my memory.  I'm kind of helpless without the computer now until It’s really kind of sad, but that's the way it is.

PATIENT O173
Huh.

DOCTOR O173
I would like to check that blood pressure again.

PATIENT O173
You want me to take the shirt off?

DOCTOR O173
Uh yeah that's not a bad idea, probably be a little easier.  So how's your life?

PATIENT O173
Okay.

DOCTOR O173
Any major problems or concerns?

PATIENT O173
Uh none, no.

DOCTOR O173
Oh yeah okay.  Are you a drinker or a smoker?

PATIENT O173
I almost quit drinking.  You know I'll go see a friend of mine once in a while at the bar when they needed to make wooden signs – I make wooden signs.

DOCTOR O173
No that's alright.

PATIENT O173
Or sports figurines.

DOCTOR O173
Right.

PATIENT O173

DOCTOR O173

DOCTOR O173

PATIENT O173
Yeah.  I'm tired all the time since that surgery, sleepy tired you know.  

DOCTOR O173

PATIENT O173

PATIENT O173
Uh, no I take them at nighttime.

DOCTOR O173

PATIENT O173

PATIENT O173

PATIENT O173
Emergency generator.  Power.

DOCTOR O173
Okay, any swelling down here?

PATIENT O173
A little bit at the top of the sock line, usually gets a little swell.  But these are new socks.  Usually with the older socks I wear I don't get nothing.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.

PATIENT O173
It's from the elastic.

DOCTOR O173
Okay can you @@@.  Alright.  How's your breathing?

PATIENT O173
Fine.

DOCTOR O173
Okay.  How much uh you know activity, I mean could you walk like a mile or something?

PATIENT O173
Yeah.

DOCTOR O173
You could?

PATIENT O173
Yeah 10-12 years that I could walk from here 25 feet and I'd have pains.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.

PATIENT O173
My jaw would ache, my arms would ache.  You know that's from the veins or something tightening up right.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.

PATIENT O173
But that was 10-12 years ago and they tried everything.

DOCTOR O173
And they wanted to do the bypass on you.

PATIENT O173
Yeah.

DOCTOR O173
But you didn't want it.

PATIENT O173
No.

DOCTOR O173
And what happened.

PATIENT O173
But they kept giving me medications and I got rid of the nitrates and I didn't need that and then it just went away.

DOCTOR O173
Okay.

PATIENT O173
You know.  It couldn't have been from quitting smoking cause that's just the past year.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.

PATIENT O173
Ten years ago I was smoking a pack and a half to two packs a day.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.  Hmm.

PATIENT O173
But now a year has passed.  I don't know what it was that I was taking or what I'm taking now.  I could walk and walk and walk and not have any you know pains like I had.

DOCTOR O173
Alright, let's see if I can find you here.  So we've got you on Toprol XL, baby aspirin, simvastatin.  Have you ever been on a medicine called lisinopril?

PATIENT O173
Not that I remember.

DOCTOR O173
When did you quit smoking exactly?

PATIENT O173
A year ago, April 10th.

DOCTOR O173
April 10th.  Alright.  Now let's take a look at your pills here.

PATIENT O173
I don't know if it's a side effect.  I'm getting like little sores on the back of my head that seem to itch.  If I scratch them they'll start bleeding like crazy yeah.

DOCTOR O173
I'll take a look.

PATIENT O173
That I think started when I started glipizide.  I'm not sure but.

DOCTOR O173
Hmm I don't know.  I've never heard of anything like that happening.

PATIENT O173
You know little sores.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.

PATIENT O173
And if I scratch on them they'll just start bleeding.

DOCTOR O173
Hmm.  Simvastatin.

PATIENT O173
This I didn't have 15 years ago.

DOCTOR O173
Hmm.

PATIENT O173
I looked at the sheet you get, you know with the medication.  Glipizide promotes weight gain.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah it can do that.

PATIENT O173
Yeah, right there 13 months.

DOCTOR O173
How much weight have you gained?

PATIENT O173
I usually weighed 165-70, now I'm at 181, well with clothes and everything it's 186 just now they weighed me.  But last week I was 180-181.

DOCTOR O173
We'll get you some more test strips.  Do you think you could get your blood drawn any time soon?

PATIENT O173
I could stop after here.

DOCTOR O173
Okay.

PATIENT O173
If the Lab is still open.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah they should be open.  How much have you had to eat today?

PATIENT O173
Oh, when I was here I had a large coffee and a bag of cookies for lunch you know.

DOCTOR O173
You know we may have you.

PATIENT O173
This morning I had cereal.

DOCTOR O173
We may have you come back when you haven't had so much to eat.

PATIENT O173
Okay fast.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah and then I'm going to talk with my boss back there but.

PATIENT O173
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O173
We may want to uh try you on a pill called lisinopril uh and it can help with the blood pressure and the kidneys.  Probably a good pill for you to be taking uh, you know you've had some kind of, some kidney disease that you've had for a long time.

PATIENT O173
Uh the last appointment I had, what was it, oh Urology.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.

PATIENT O173
The 25th or something like that, it was a couple weeks ago.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.

PATIENT O173
And before that I had an ultrasound.

DOCTOR O173
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O173
And they checked you know how much urine, they had to check how much urine I had in the morning, at night and you know @@@ and they checked the kidneys, there's nothing wrong with the kidneys.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah I just mean like your kidney function and like we call or we measure with this thing called creatinine which normal is 1 and you're more like around 2.

PATIENT O173
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O173
Uh and it's been that way for quite a while and even back uh three years ago, even back in 2002 it was 1.8 which is about what it is now.

PATIENT O173
Yeah.

DOCTOR O173
Um it still is, for people that have kidney disease and high blood pressure, heart disease, it kind of helps with all of that stuff.

PATIENT O173
Oh uh-huh.

DOCTOR O173
Um so it's something that I'm probably going to talk with my boss back there.

PATIENT O173
Okay.

DOCTOR O173
But it's probably something that you should be taking okay.

PATIENT O173
Okay, I'll try it.

DOCTOR O173
Um let me go talk to one of my bosses back there.

PATIENT O173
Okay.

DOCTOR O173
And I will be right back in.

PATIENT O173
You don't need this anyway.

DOCTOR O173
No I don't need that anymore.

PATIENT O173
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT 35:34  DOCTOR IN:  43:31)

DOCTOR O173
Alright.  So I was going through things with one of my supervisors back there and she definitely agrees that this medicine lisinopril is something that you should be on.

PATIENT O173
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O173
Uh it's for blood pressure but it also is to help the kidneys and things like that.  Okay.  Just take it once a day.  You should take it whenever you take your metoprolol and whatever else.

PATIENT O173
Yeah I take them in the evening when I go to bed.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah that's fine, you can keep doing that.

PATIENT O173
Just the water pill I take in the morning.

DOCTOR O173
Okay.  And it's been a while since we checked cholesterol and all that good stuff so we'll just have you come back um.  What we would like to do is, I don't know if you're going to get your new medicine today or if you'll wait and have it mailed to you.

PATIENT O173
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O173
But about five days or so after you've been taking that pill then come in and have all this blood work done.  That way we can make sure it's agreeing with your kidneys.

PATIENT O173
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O173
Okay.

PATIENT O173
Sure.

DOCTOR O173
Alright.  

PATIENT O173
Do I still take the glucose readings?

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.  I ordered the strips.  Yeah I reordered the strips.

PATIENT O173
That expired.

DOCTOR O173
Right, right, I renewed those.

PATIENT O173
Okay.  Those I'll get in the mail?

DOCTOR O173
Yep.

PATIENT O173
Okay, good enough.

DOCTOR O173
Alright.  I would like to see you back in about three months.  I don't want to wait a year this time if that's okay.  That's a little too long.  I'm guessing you may have had a cancelled appointment, I had to cancel or something in there cause usually uh we don't want to wait quite that long.  Maybe it was like all the surgery and something uh I had to do is why you cancelled.  Alright.  

PATIENT O173
Yeah now when I had surgery last July for the cancer I remember the nurses telling me that they gave me insulin for high blood sugar.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.  We do that in the hospital.

PATIENT O173
Yeah I remember her saying that you know.  I spent like three days or maybe four days here and there was no follow up after that.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah it would've been nice if they would've sent you back to see me.

PATIENT O173
From July so that's 7, 9 months ago.

DOCTOR O173
Okay well you've been hanging in there pretty good so.  Uh this is for you to take to check out.

PATIENT O173
Okay.

DOCTOR O173
I ordered that new pill; you can either go down to the Pharmacy and wait.  I don't know if you've been down there.

PATIENT O173
Yes, yeah I've been there.

DOCTOR O173
Sometimes it takes a while.

PATIENT O173
Half hour.

DOCTOR O173
Yeah.

PATIENT O173
Usually a half hour.

DOCTOR O173
You can get it now um.  If you get it now then you can start taking it even tonight and just when you get your blood drawn be sure you've taken that pill for about 3-5 days.

PATIENT O173
Okay.

DOCTOR O173
And then come in and we'll check the diabetes and the kidneys and just check everything.

PATIENT O173
Will I get a letter now to come in for the lab?

DOCTOR O173
No.

PATIENT O173
Or.

DOCTOR O173
I've already ordered everything.

PATIENT O173
Okay.

DOCTOR O173
You just have to show up.

PATIENT O173
Okay.

DOCTOR O173
On the first floor.

PATIENT O173
Yeah, yeah I know where it is.

DOCTOR O173
You know tell them who you are and then they'll know what all to do.

PATIENT O173
After taking that medication for about a week?

DOCTOR O173
Yes.

PATIENT O173
Okay, sure.

DOCTOR O173
Because normally when we start that we have to check the kidneys and this way we'll just do it all at once.

PATIENT O173
Okay.

DOCTOR O173
Sound like a plan?

PATIENT O173
Sure.

DOCTOR O173
Alright sir.  I'll let you be on your way.  @@@ with the computer problem here.
