DOCTOR L687
PATIENT?

PATIENT L687 
How you doing?

DOCTOR L687
Alright thank you.  @@@.

PATIENT L687
Uh DOCTOR.  I don't care.

DOCTOR L687
So what's going on?  What brings you in today?

PATIENT L687
Okay uh, I was here I think the 6th and the reason I came in, well let me backtrack.  In September I had bladder surgery for removal of the bladder because of uh cancer, tumor, and then I noticed this was starting to get swelled up.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.

PATIENT L687
Just the left, this one here okay.

DOCTOR L687
Alright.

PATIENT L687
Now um after surgery when I was in Recovery it swelled up.  They had that machine on there to do the pumping.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah.

PATIENT L687
And then I don't know why it's swelling up.

DOCTOR L687
So you had surgery when did you say?

PATIENT L687
September 6th.

DOCTOR L687
It swelled up then, following surgery.

PATIENT L687
Right.

DOCTOR L687
Was it both sides or just the left?

PATIENT L687
Just the left.

DOCTOR L687
Did it slowly go away then after surgery or has it been there since then?

PATIENT L687
No, it went away um.  I had a month's supply of injections I was giving to myself for clots.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.  Have you ever had a clot, blood clot before?

PATIENT L687
No not that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR L687
So when did you first notice that it was starting to swell again?

PATIENT L687
Um probably maybe a month ago.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.  Has it gotten worse or is it just about the same from when you noticed it?

PATIENT L687
No it was worse but then it went down.

DOCTOR L687
So it went down a little bit.

PATIENT L687
But it's still swollen.

DOCTOR L687
Swollen still.

PATIENT L687
Oh wait a minute, survey, I don't know if NAME gave it to me.

DOCTOR L687
Oh for the thing.

PATIENT L687
Oh it must. 

DOCTOR L687
Yeah I think so.

PATIENT L687
Can I leave it right here?

DOCTOR L687
Yeah that's okay.

PATIENT L687
(Laughter)  

DOCTOR L687
So it got more swollen, let's see and now it's went down.  Alright.  Any pain associated with it?  Any redness?

PATIENT L687
Just the way it is now.

DOCTOR L687
Prior to this all starting back in September, had you ever had uh swelling like that before, in this leg at all?

PATIENT L687
No, nothing.

DOCTOR L687
You don't have any history of this before.  Any other medical issues, high blood pressure.  You don't have any problem with heart disease or heart attack or heart failure? 

PATIENT L687
Uh they discovered I have a fib.

DOCTOR L687
A fib.  Are you on Coumadin?

PATIENT L687
No.

DOCTOR L687
No.  Let's see your medications, you have an albuterol inhaler.

PATIENT L687
Which I really do not use that often at all.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.  They have you on Digoxin is that for the a fib I assume?

PATIENT L687
Yeah it's for the heart.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.

PATIENT L687
Once a day. Taking that.

DOCTOR L687
You're on the metoprolol?

PATIENT L687
Right twice a day.

DOCTOR L687
Sildenafil?

PATIENT L687
Yeah the reason um they uh prescribed that is because before I had the uh surgery to remove the bladder at the same time they removed the prostate because it was high PSA.

DOCTOR L687
I see.

PATIENT L687
So while they were there they might as well take it and prior to that surgery um my wife and I enjoyed a very good sexual active life in the 44 years we've been married.

DOCTOR L687
Sure.

PATIENT L687
Now after the surgery I cannot get an erection uh.  They told me that they would do all they could with the nerve-sparing.

DOCTOR L687
Hmm.

PATIENT L687
Okay so what they uh started out doing is um giving me the uh sildenafil which is I guess Viagra.

DOCTOR L687
Viagra.

PATIENT L687
And uh that is not working.

DOCTOR L687
Hmm.

PATIENT L687
They got me a pump.

DOCTOR L687
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L687
And I've been using that but I stopped using that because I can, it'll get hard but as soon as I take the pump away, even with the rings on the penis.

DOCTOR L687
Hmm.

PATIENT L687
It just.

DOCTOR L687
Goes away.

PATIENT L687
Goes away and then uh what else.  I'll be coming back here on the 25th I believe where they will either give me an injection in the penis with some medicine or put it right down the urethra.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT L687
Okay and we'll see if that works so.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah.

PATIENT L687
I'm fucked.  Excuse me.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah that's a difficult thing and unfortunately that's one of the concerns with taking out the prostate and you see sometimes there'll be erectile dysfunction afterwards.

PATIENT L687
And like I said you know prior to the surgery you know I didn't have any problems at all.  You know I didn't have any ED at all but then they warned me.  They also said that it might take up until a year for it to come back where I'll be able to get an erection again but if none of this therapy, so-called therapy doesn't work, will it come back naturally? I don't know.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah.

PATIENT L687
Nobody knows.

DOCTOR L687
Um how about, have you been having shortness of breath at all or problems breathing since you've had the swelling?

PATIENT L687
No not really.

DOCTOR L687
No chest pain at all?

PATIENT L687
No and you know I, I'm a smoker and unfortunately I still smoke uh.  They asked me if I needed help quitting and they said you know if I quit you know I'll do it on my own.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.

PATIENT L687
But I drastically cut down you know from what I was smoking before the surgery.

DOCTOR L687
Sure.  Yeah I mean if you would like to quit smoking, if you need any help at that time whenever you decide you're are ready.

PATIENT L687
Yeah they all say these things here.

DOCTOR L687
Um it looks like that was normal.  The echocardiogram, just looking at some of your stuff that was normal.  Your heart function was relatively normal back in August.  I don't know if you remember them doing that.

PATIENT L687
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L687
So yeah, let me have a look at you here.  Have a seat over here.  Take a moment to wash my hands.  I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs here.

PATIENT L687
Want the jacket off?

DOCTOR L687
No I'll just slide down here no problem.  Take some deep breaths for me.  @@@, a little bright light in the eyes.  So never any swelling in this one at all?

PATIENT L687
No.

DOCTOR L687
No pain there, you don't have anything there.  How much would you say it was at one point?  Quite a bit worse from what it is now?

PATIENT L687
You know just maybe 10 or 15% more than it is now.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah.  

PATIENT L687
And in the back it's swollen.

DOCTOR L687
How about the thigh at all, do you notice it in the thigh at all?

PATIENT L687
No.

DOCTOR L687
It stops at the knee?

PATIENT L687
Yeah.

DOCTOR L687
No pain on pushing here.  No pain when I'm doing the anything there at all?

PATIENT L687
No.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.  I'm going to have you lay back down.  Let's see your pouch over here.

PATIENT L687
Right here.

DOCTOR L687
You haven't had any issues with that; it's been draining fine and everything?

PATIENT L687
Yes.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.  No pain in the belly here.

PATIENT L687
No.

DOCTOR L687
When I'm pushing around anywhere.

PATIENT L687
No.

DOCTOR L687
Or anything like that.  Alright. Let me sit you back up here.

PATIENT L687
Can I uh put my socks back on?

DOCTOR L687
Yeah, yeah that's fine.

PATIENT L687
And after I was here I saw the last time, the NURSE.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah.

PATIENT L687
And she said that DOCTOR would probably call.  Well he never called but she called saying that he wanted me to come in here.

DOCTOR L687
Today yeah.

PATIENT L687
Sooner than the 25th.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah to see me yeah.

PATIENT L687
Because of the possibility of maybe a clot.

DOCTOR L687
Blood clot.

PATIENT L687
Yeah.

DOCTOR L687
That's what we're probably concerned about.  So, yeah sometimes blood clots can cause swelling in the leg.  I think we should, I'm going to talk to my attending but I think we should probably check.  I'm not really convinced about there being a blood clot in there because usually when you have a blood clot in there patients have a lot of pain associated with it in the calf or they'll even have some redness and swelling um which you told me you have not had an issue with.

PATIENT L687
Right.

DOCTOR L687
But you are at an increased risk of blood clots just because you have had surgery here in the past and the tests they do is pretty easy, it's just some jelly on the leg and they do a Doppler ultrasound, similar to an ultrasound.

PATIENT L687
Yeah that's what she had mentioned.

DOCTOR L687
Like on a pregnant woman.

PATIENT L687
Now I might mention this, now I've never been diagnosed but when the weather is cold.

DOCTOR L687
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L687
My fingers on both hands, not at the same time, might turn white and uh I think it's something called Raynaud.

DOCTOR L687
Raynaud's phenomenon yeah.

PATIENT L687
But then after a while, you know they warm up and it goes away but it happens quite often.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.  Yeah that's another one of those things that's common.

PATIENT L687
Hmm.

DOCTOR L687
And unless it causes you a lot of disability and pain there are medications you can take for it but they don't work that well.

PATIENT L687
No.

DOCTOR L687
Usually our thing is, wear gloves when you're gonna be outside.

PATIENT L687
I don't want to take any more medication.  I'm taking enough now.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah.

PATIENT L687
And I just don't like to take any pills whatsoever but what are you gonna do as you get older.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah, that's just part of the process.  Um let me go chat with the other doc, with the attending doctor and talk about if there's anything else you know we'll want to do or think about and then I'll come back on in and let you know okay.

PATIENT L687
Okay.

DOCTOR L687
Be back with you shortly.

(DOCTOR OUT:  61:27  DOCTOR IN:  69:44)

(Knock on door)

PATIENT L687
Hello.

DOCTOR L687
Alright, sorry for the delay.

PATIENT L687
Doctor how do you spell your name?

DOCTOR L687
DOCTOR.

PATIENT L687
And your first name?

DOCTOR L687
DOCTOR.

PATIENT L687
Yeah okay, thank you.

DOCTOR L687
So I called the Vascular Lab and actually I'll send you up to the fifth floor to have them do that test right now.

PATIENT L687
Oh okay.

DOCTOR L687
Just to make sure that that's not what's going on cause that's requires treatment if it is.  

PATIENT L687
What could it be if isn't a clot?

DOCTOR L687
If it's not a clot I'm not exactly sure what is causing it um and if it bothers you, we can try like some TED hose type things which is just compression, type of compression stocking.

PATIENT L687
Oh.

DOCTOR L687
Um but otherwise we can, I was going to just have you follow back up with DOCTOR cause you're scheduled to see him on the 28th of this month here so in a few weeks.

PATIENT L687
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR L687
Um and the other thing you can do is sometimes people just have some difficulties with maintaining their fluid balance and they lose fluid and usually it's bilateral which is kind of like.

PATIENT L687
Well I drink a lot of liquids.

DOCTOR L687
Uh-huh.

PATIENT L687
All day long.  Not only fruit juices but water, coffee, tea, diet soda.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah.

PATIENT L687
I'm constantly emptying the bag.

DOCTOR L687
The bag.  You could cut down, try cutting.  How much are you drinking in a full day?  Would you say how many you know how much would you say 8 ounce?

PATIENT L687
Uh I might have like a beer before dinner but not every day.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.

PATIENT L687
Or like uh the other night we had lamb chops and I had a glass this much of wine.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.

PATIENT L687
Dark or red wine.  What would drinking have to do with the swelling?

DOCTOR L687
So this fluid is what, @@@ sometimes.

PATIENT L687
So that's fluid?

DOCTOR L687
Yeah I mean that's fluid, that's what is swollen that's actually fluid, you know.

PATIENT L687
Really.

DOCTOR L687
That went out of your blood vessels and into the tissue which is why I think.  I mean initially you had this in the hospital and a lot of times when you're in the hospital having surgery you get a lot of fluid.  Do you remember, they probably gave you IV fluids and you know things and that's very common in patients you know who get, are in the hospital and have uh get a lot of intravenous fluids that sometimes they'll get swelling particularly in the legs.

PATIENT L687
From the IVs?

DOCTOR L687
Just from, more fluid, so your body, you only have so much space inside the blood vessels to put fluid and if you're, you know you should get rid of fluid or urinating or you get rid of through sweating and stuff like that but generally it's urinating out and sometimes if you're getting too much fluid, you get more fluid than actually the kidneys can keep up with cause all fluid has to be filtered out through the kidneys and it kind of builds up and it has to go somewhere um because you know fluid is something that's not compressible and only so much can fit in the blood vessels and when the blood vessels get too full it kind of leaks out and will go into the tissues.

PATIENT L687
Hmm.

DOCTOR L687
And then that's where you end up getting the swelling and the edema and the legs are a real common site for that to happen.  It's just a little concerning cause you never have problems with the right leg it's only ever in the left leg.

PATIENT L687
Just the left one yeah.

DOCTOR L687
We'll see what this shows and if you, are you interested in trying some TED hose type thing, stockings, would you wear that?

PATIENT L687
Well my wife can get them at her work, she works at Walmart.

DOCTOR L687
Okay.  You can try that and then come back and is it is still really bothering the only other thing we can do just to see if it is a big fluid imbalance we can give you a diuretic which will just remove a little bit.

PATIENT L687
Is that like a water pill?

DOCTOR L687
Yeah um a water pill.

PATIENT L687
Uh no, no like I said nothing hurts.

DOCTOR L687
Yeah but I mean it's also a matter of what becomes a bother.  If it bothers you if this was you know.  We worry about things that can cause concern, big problems.

PATIENT L687
Well am I drinking too much during the day based on what I told you, like I said.

DOCTOR L687
Well I mean it's not like you're drinking a tone, you're getting some but you don't seem to be drinking a ton of fluids throughout the day.  But if you want to cut back a few days and see if that effects the swelling, I mean see if that makes any difference.

PATIENT L687
Yeah I can try that; I can experiment with that sure.

DOCTOR L687
I mean sort of drink some fluid, obviously throughout the day but first things first, make sure that there's not a blood clot in here.

PATIENT L687
Right.

DOCTOR L687
Causing all this um so I'll sign that and I will forward my notes to DOCTOR and if there is a blood clot I'll of course get the results you know will be back later today but call me and we'll start you on a blood thinner, something like what you were on before like the Lovenox, the shots.

PATIENT L687
It was something else.  What'd you call it?

DOCTOR L687
Lovenox or enoxaparin, was that what you were on?  Was it a blood thinner shot?

PATIENT L687
You know, all I know is just like I put it in and it just, when I pushed the needle went in and came right out.

DOCTOR L687
Hmm.  Maybe we're @@@.

PATIENT L687
I can't think of the name.  But I had a 30 day supply of it and they told me to use it all.

DOCTOR L687
@@@.  Alright.

PATIENT L687
Okay so where do I go now?

DOCTOR L687
Fifth floor, just go to the check-in desk on the fifth floor.

PATIENT L687
Okay.  That's all I have to do?

DOCTOR L687
Yep.

PATIENT L687
Okie doke.

DOCTOR L687
And they'll do the test real quick to be sure.  If it's positive they'll give me a call.

PATIENT L687
Yeah let me know uh how late are you gonna be here today?

DOCTOR L687
They'll, if it's positive they'll have you stay there and give me a call.

PATIENT L687
Oh I see okay.

DOCTOR L687
Just check out here.  He's already scheduled to follow up with DOCTOR but if he needs anything he can also be with me.

PATIENT L687
Okay thanks doctor.

DOCTOR L687
Nice meeting you, take care.
