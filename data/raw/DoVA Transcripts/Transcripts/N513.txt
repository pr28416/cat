Everything else checks out.  It's just; we just want to get that blood pressure under better control, that's all it is.  It's one of those things you don't feel it when it's high but you know over time it can cause problems.

PATIENT N513
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR N513
Okay.  So we'll start back that amlodipine again.  I think last month um the doctor you saw last month wanted to start that uh and I agree with it since the blood pressure's still high.  I think it would be a good thing to start that so, it's just a once a day small pill okay.

PATIENT N513
Okay.

DOCTOR N513
Is there anything else bothering you today?

PATIENT N513
No, the only problem that I really have that won't go away.  See I got arthritis and it was over here in my legs and never operate.  I always get pain @@@.  And that goes from right here all the way down to the ankle and that really bother me, came on @@@.

DOCTOR N513
You have another medicine for nerves that you were on, gabapentin.  Do you know if you were taking that?

PATIENT N513
I do not.

DOCTOR N513
Okay.  Your bottle was empty.

PATIENT N513
Yeah.

DOCTOR N513
Okay.  So why don't we refill that when you go to the Pharmacy okay cause that really helps with the nerve pain.

PATIENT N513
Feel free to.

DOCTOR N513
Okay not a problem.

PATIENT N513
It bothers me night and day.

DOCTOR N513
It bothers you night and day okay.  So this one you take, you take the pill twice a day okay.  It's called gabapentin.

PATIENT N513
And then one day they is cold.

DOCTOR N513

PATIENT N513
No no sore.

DOCTOR N513
Okay.

PATIENT N513

DOCTOR N513
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N513
And one time they said they was too tight.

DOCTOR N513

DOCTOR N513
Yeah.  Do you see the Podiatry, the foot doctor?

PATIENT N513

DOCTOR N513

PATIENT N513
I check it.  The last time I checked it was the other day or later on Wednesday.  When I last checked it, it was on Monday morning.

DOCTOR N513
Okay.

PATIENT N513
Well what I mean I guess I can feel it if my sugars run a bit low or high.

DOCTOR N513
Okay.

PATIENT N513
And I put a little watch on that.

DOCTOR N513
Well your labs are showing the same thing, that your sugars have been pretty well controlled.

PATIENT N513

DOCTOR N513
Before you eat that's good.

PATIENT N513
They run around 132.

DOCTOR N513

DOCTOR N513
That's not too bad, we can work with that.  Okay.  I'm going to go talk to DOCTOR and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT N513
Alright.  But you know the only thing, the only thing some big problem I got is some teeth.  They made three sets from here.

DOCTOR N513
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N513
And they don't work out.  And you go to the doctor to get you a set @@@ and so but since it high.

DOCTOR N513
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N513

PATIENT N513
Don't cover it there.

DOCTOR N513

PATIENT N513
At Hines.

DOCTOR N513
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N513
But DOCTOR told me she will try to get it because I need those teeth cause that's why I'm losing so much weight.

DOCTOR N513
Oh because you can't eat without the teeth.

PATIENT N513
Yes.

DOCTOR N513
Alright, I'll ask DOCTOR.  I'm not exactly sure what to do with that but um.

PATIENT N513
They used to having me going to surgery, I go to Hines and so when I got my leg broke on the bus they had the you know they @@@ until I got straightened out so when I got through, when I got through with that they had to call me back and start over here.  We'll just have to see where they go.

DOCTOR N513
Okay.  Okay.  Let me ask DOCTOR about the false teeth and check on those.

PATIENT N513
Uh I told DOCTOR about the teeth thing so she said well there wasn't too much she could do about it. 

DOCTOR N513
Yeah.

PATIENT N513
Told me to go down to the University on uh.

DOCTOR N513
Oh right, the dentist school at the University of Illinois.

PATIENT N513
University yeah.

DOCTOR N513
That's where we recommend people over there for dentistry actually.  A lot of times the VA doesn't cover very much dental work unless you're very service-connected and most people don't have that much service connection to cover all their dental work so there's a dental school down there that works at a pretty reasonable rate.

PATIENT N513
Oh I see.

DOCTOR N513
We can give you the information for that again today, want to try that?

PATIENT N513
I sure enough need it.  That's what I'm telling you, that's why I lost weight cause I haven't eaten.  I can't chew my food.
