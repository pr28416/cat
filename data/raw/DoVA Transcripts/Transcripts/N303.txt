DOCTOR N303
Hi I'm DOCTOR.  You can set this here, over here.

PATIENT N303
Okay.

DOCTOR N303

PATIENT N303
Yep.

DOCTOR N303
@@@ talk to me and @@@ everything else I need.

PATIENT N303
Okay.

DOCTOR N303
Are there any specific issues or questions that you have?  @@@.

PATIENT N303
@@@.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
Yes.  Uh I'm out of a lot of this.

DOCTOR N303
Okay I can renew them.

PATIENT N303
Uh this one, this one they gave me for my pain.

DOCTOR N303
Pain.

PATIENT N303
It's, I'm running out of that, I'm done cause I've been doubling and tripling them and stuff I take a lot of them so I'm out of those now.

DOCTOR N303
Oh where do you have pain?

PATIENT N303
Uh my left hip.

DOCTOR N303
@@@.

PATIENT N303
Arthritis in my knee.

DOCTOR N303
Okay have you tried anything else like physical therapy?

PATIENT N303
Well um, I just got to the point where I'm lighter now where I can do it.  Before I was 350 pounds and it's like running around and stuff like that you know.

DOCTOR N303
Oh.

PATIENT N303
And then when summer kicks I'm going to be gone on my bike, I take off so when summer comes I'm gone.

DOCTOR N303
Okay um so you have this arthritis in your hips.

PATIENT N303
And I got my knee.  I had back surgery and I had, I guess I aggravated my sciatic nerve.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
But my foot's like numb.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
You know it doesn't have as much feeling as this one.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
But it has a little feeling.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
Alright and every once in a while that sciatic nerve hurts.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
That I think, the arthritis and that, I think that's why they gave it to me, I'm not sure.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  I see.  Um so I just letting you know that tramadol is kind of addicting and I don't want you to take it for too long.  That's the only thing, that's why I want you to go to Physical Therapy to see if they can do injections there.

PATIENT N303
Alright.

DOCTOR N303
To see if that will go away and is the tramadol helping you?

PATIENT N303
I don't think so.  I mean it lightens the pain a little bit but.

DOCTOR N303
I think you need something else that might be a little bit better and long-acting.

PATIENT N303
That would be nice.

DOCTOR N303
Like meloxicam, it's an NSAID, it's an anti-inflammatory drug.  Um it works on a different part of the pain system um and I can try to give you that and see how that goes and if that doesn't help you call me and then we can change it again.

PATIENT N303
Alright.

DOCTOR N303
So let's try that because arthritis is inflammation.

PATIENT N303
Yep.

DOCTOR N303
Um and so we'll try to give you some meloxicam and see if that makes it better.

PATIENT N303
/alright.

DOCTOR N303
Um so you take ibuprofen and does that work?

PATIENT N303
Uh they just gave me that when I had my ear infection.

DOCTOR N303
Oh you don't need to take this, you don't take this?

PATIENT N303
I don't take that anyway.

DOCTOR N303
Oh so, you don't take it.

PATIENT N303
And I had an ear infection.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
I was here and I went down to the Ear and Throat, you know down there okay.  They said okay you look okay.  Next week it came back with a vengeance.

DOCTOR N303
Oh really, so it started coming back?

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
So I got another appointment with them today.

DOCTOR N303
Oh the ENT doctors.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
Okay so you're going to follow up with them?

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
Why do you have so many recurrent ear infections?

PATIENT N303
Yeah that's what I'd like to know.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
Now my daughter read that I could be allergic to milk or something, have allergies.

DOCTOR N303
No.

PATIENT N303
Have allergies.

DOCTOR N303
Not in your ears, it makes you have diarrhea but not ears.

PATIENT N303
Alright.

DOCTOR N303
Not your ears okay, so.

PATIENT N303
Yep.

DOCTOR N303
So besides the arthritis and the knee pain um and the ear infection.

PATIENT N303
Back pain.

DOCTOR N303
You have back pain?

PATIENT N303
Yes.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  Um but you never went to Physical Therapy?

PATIENT N303
Uh I had it when I had my back surgery.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  I think it’s a good idea, yeah so because what we do is first we control the pain but if that doesn't work we always recommend physical therapy.  Sometimes that can actually help a lot.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
And if that doesn't work then you think of surgery and you think of other options.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
So I want you to go through that level and if it doesn't get you to where you want it to be then we'll talk about something else.

PATIENT N303
Alright.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  Um and then you got your labs done today which was great.  Your cholesterol is excellent.

PATIENT N303
@@@.

DOCTOR N303
So good job.  I'm happy about that.  I don't have to adjust anything.  Your creatinine is a little elevated.

PATIENT N303
What is?

DOCTOR N303
The um your creatinine, or um kidney function.  Do you have kidney disease at all?

PATIENT N303
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR N303
Did you start any new medications?

PATIENT N303
Um, no.  Wait uh, well the ibuprofen I was taking that for my ear.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
Um and I just quit.  I don't like ibuprofen.  I know what they did to the guys that did them in Arizona and they would go on dialysis just because of that you know.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
So I don't take ibuprofen, I don't like it.

DOCTOR N303
Yeah so that's why.  So how long did you take the ibuprofen for, just recently?

PATIENT N303

DOCTOR N303
You took it four times a day?

PATIENT N303
No, no.

DOCTOR N303
You took it how many times a day, once?

PATIENT N303
Two, probably one or two.

DOCTOR N303
One or two, how many days?

PATIENT N303
Uh maybe three.

DOCTOR N303
Oh, maybe three okay.

PATIENT N303
Yeah I didn't take it all that long you know.

DOCTOR N303
Oh okay.  Was this last week?

PATIENT N303
Yep.

DOCTOR N303
That could be the reason the creatinine bumped but, so I don't want you to take this medication okay.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
Alright and so I'm

PATIENT N303
So I agree, I don't like it either.

DOCTOR N303
Yeah @@@ creatinine.  Okay.

PATIENT N303
Now I used to be on a 10 mg of high blood pressure and then they jacked me up to 20.

DOCTOR N303
Yeah.

PATIENT N303
When I was in all that pain, but that made your blood pressure go up right, pain?

DOCTOR N303
It can.  But it looks like it's controlled with the 20.

PATIENT N303
So it's.

DOCTOR N303
I don't want to decrease it.

PATIENT N303
It's staying there.

DOCTOR N303

PATIENT N303
No it didn't seem like it worked.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
You know.

DOCTOR N303
Yeah.  That’s fine. Let me see what other medications we have that we can give you.

PATIENT N303
I am not comfortable talking about it, but she wanted me to find out so.

DOCTOR N303
@@@.  A lot patients come with the same type of issue. Don’t worry about it.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
So um do you have difficulty kind of achieving them or is it that you can't.

PATIENT N303
No I can't count on it yeah.

DOCTOR N303
You’re not taking too much alcohol?

PATIENT N303
Nope.

DOCTOR N303
You're not using any illicit drugs?

PATIENT N303
Nope.

DOCTOR N303
No heart disease or anything like that?  You do have hypertension right?

PATIENT N303
Hypertension what's that?

DOCTOR N303
High blood pressure.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
Not any more.

DOCTOR N303
Not any more yeah that's true.  @@@.  So let's see Levitra.

PATIENT N303
I do have shortness of breath.  I mean.

DOCTOR N303
Yeah I know.  I'm gonna have to figure that out.  Maybe you're going to need to get pulmonary function tests to categorize why you have the shortness of breath.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
Um and the wheezing only happened at night?  Did it wake you up at night?

PATIENT N303
When I lay down.  When I'm laying down yeah.

DOCTOR N303
When you're laying down?

PATIENT N303
Yeah I start wheezing.

DOCTOR N303
Then you use the Combivent or the albuterol inhaler?

PATIENT N303
Yeah I take a shot.

DOCTOR N303
How often do you use it every night?

PATIENT N303
Oh no, maybe once a week.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
Maybe not even that, maybe once every two weeks you know.

DOCTOR N303
Once every two weeks.

PATIENT N303
Or once a week you know.  It's hardly at all.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
But you know.  And a lot of times I just cough real hard and I can get rid of it, it goes away.

DOCTOR N303
Oh really good.

PATIENT N303
Yeah, like it opens up the breathing or whatever and I know because I'll keep it right next to me and I'll carry it with me.

DOCTOR N303
Oh.

PATIENT N303
You know.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  So when you told DOCTOR that it didn't work did she give you something else?

PATIENT N303
No I never got a chance to talk to her after that.

DOCTOR N303
Oh, so that's why you're here.  You're with me since she left.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
That makes sense, got it, got it, got it.  Okay so let's see what else we can do.  Now I see, she gave you vardenafil which is, let's just see the medication.  Okay so she gave you Levitra like you had said, @@@ that way.  So 10 mg and then you used the 20 mg and it didn't help.  That's both of them?

PATIENT N303
The half one didn't.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
Um the whole one, I don't really remember.

DOCTOR N303
You don't remember if it was?

PATIENT N303
That was a long time ago and I don't have a real good, I don't know.  She just asked me to find out something about it.

DOCTOR N303
Do you want to try that one again or not?

PATIENT N303
Um it doesn't matter.  I could try it again and if it does work well then that's great I mean.

DOCTOR N303
Once you may be getting one because it didn't stay up right?

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  So you're able to penetrate okay?

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
But then it lasted only like 2 minutes?

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
Yeah it didn't last long, that's all.

DOCTOR N303
Alright so what I'm gonna do we'll order another one called Viagra and then you need to use a full pill.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
I'll give you four pills of that.  So that's that, we took care of that issue and then @@@.

PATIENT N303
@@@.

DOCTOR N303
@@@.

PATIENT N303
No.

DOCTOR N303
It can cause @@@.  So did you get a sleep study?

PATIENT N303
Yes.

DOCTOR N303
Um they told you to do it again right but you haven't gotten that done?

PATIENT N303
Uh he told me there's nothing wrong with me and he said um.  The sleep doctor up there said here this is the mask you're gonna want if you get to order one and then I called back to the doctor and the doctor says that everything is fine.

DOCTOR N303
So if the sleep study, they said at the bottom, they didn't tell you to take it again?

PATIENT N303
I don't remember.

DOCTOR N303
So you got it done in September 2010 and.

PATIENT N303
I just wake up all the time at night to go to the bathroom because I have to go to the bathroom all the time you know.  I go to the bathroom a lot you know.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  So they told us to repeat the sleep study in a few months so I might want to do it again for you.  Are you okay with that?

PATIENT N303
Um, just have to, I got to give like two weeks notice so I can schedule it when she's working then I can do this.

DOCTOR N303
Oh yeah they'll call you.

PATIENT N303
Okay.

DOCTOR N303
And they'll figure out when to do it.

PATIENT N303
Alright.

DOCTOR N303
So you have daytime drowsiness?

PATIENT N303
No.

DOCTOR N303
You feel tired?

PATIENT N303
No.

DOCTOR N303
Do you sleep well at night?

PATIENT N303
Yep.

DOCTOR N303
@@@ okay.

PATIENT N303
But I'm not tired during the day like you know.  I'm up all day.  See I have that wheezing right now.

DOCTOR N303
Why don't we go ahead and do a pulmonary function test on you?  I might want have you do that.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
That sounds like asthma. I don't know.  So I may have you see a little PM&R, the rehab based people for your back.

PATIENT N303
Okay.

DOCTOR N303
@@@.

PATIENT N303
Alright, they'll call me?

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
Alright, alright.

DOCTOR N303
And @@@.

PATIENT N303
Yeah if you think it'll help that, I'll give it a shot.

DOCTOR N303
Yeah.

PATIENT N303
Cause I know when I missed that one I think I was in Minnesota when, when I was supposed to go and I didn't get back in time or something like that and I'm real bad at remembering to do that stuff.

DOCTOR N303
And then one thing, did they ever do an ultrasound of your liver?

PATIENT N303
Yep.

DOCTOR N303
Where did they do it, here?

PATIENT N303
Uh no they did it in Phoenix.

DOCTOR N303
Oh.

PATIENT N303
Uh they did it before I had the hep C treatment.

DOCTOR N303
And then afterwards they haven't done it?

PATIENT N303
Um no.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
I don't believe so.  I don't remember what they did or not, but all the blood work comes back 0 now so.

DOCTOR N303
Yeah they were supposed to repeat in September but they never repeated it.  

PATIENT N303
The blood work?

DOCTOR N303
No the ultrasound.

PATIENT N303
Oh the ultrasound okay.

DOCTOR N303
While you're going, oh this is the ultrasound scheduled so let's see when they were going to it September 26th, we can wait on that.

PATIENT N303

DOCTOR N303
No not this September.

PATIENT N303

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh, that's an ultrasound.

PATIENT N303
Yep.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303

PATIENT N303
What's the GI Department?

DOCTOR N303

PATIENT N303
Okay.

DOCTOR N303
Oh okay.  Sorry about that but I think it's pretty controlled right now.

PATIENT N303
I think so.

DOCTOR N303
So were you on treatment in Phoenix?

PATIENT N303
Yeah for six months I was on it.

DOCTOR N303
Oh.

PATIENT N303
That was hard, that was hard.  I never want to go through that again.

DOCTOR N303
Do you smoke?

PATIENT N303
Uh maybe one cigarette every 2-3 days.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
But I chew tobacco.

DOCTOR N303
One cigarette every two or three days?

PATIENT N303

PATIENT N303
Cause it was so hard for me to get to the VA to do all my meds stuff and all that crap and then when they mailed them people were stealing them.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
So I said well screw this I just went to access and I go to Walgreens to pick my meds up so then I just started using them you know.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
It was free so I said you know, I just used that but.

DOCTOR N303
So do you have records or not?

PATIENT N303
No.

DOCTOR N303

PATIENT N303
I wouldn't even know the first way about going to get it.

DOCTOR N303
Hmm.  But they did, did they ever say anything bad about it?

PATIENT N303
No I think they said come back, if I still was there he said come back in five years or something like that.

DOCTOR N303
Alright.

PATIENT N303

DOCTOR N303

PATIENT N303
But it wasn't, no cancer, no nothing, no polyp you know.

DOCTOR N303
Did they take out 12 polyps or?

PATIENT N303
No, 12 things on each side.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  How many polyps did you have?

PATIENT N303
Um I don't think any, this was uh, I guess that they, the @@@ detects, yeah I don't know.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
I can't remember what it was.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  That's okay we'll figure it out.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.  So I know it wasn't cancer and I had it done the end of 2010 and I had it done in 2008 when I was locked up.

DOCTOR N303
You were locked up, what do you mean?

PATIENT N303
Locked up.  Jail.

DOCTOR N303
Jail, why?

PATIENT N303
Um that's when I had my hey day of drugs.

DOCTOR N303
Oh, so you did do illicits in the past?

PATIENT N303
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR N303
They aren't good.

PATIENT N303
I know.

DOCTOR N303
Right, so tell me your other problems, low back pain.

PATIENT N303
Yes.  Every once in a while I get a shooting pain in like my sciatic nerve.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
Where I used to get it, I know right where it's at because @@@.  My left foot, I got I don't know maybe, you know how you stub your toe and it really hurts.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
Well if I stub any one of these toes, it don't hurt at all.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
I mean when I hit something and stub it you know and I know I kicked it I says oh, okay, that's happened I don't have to worry about it cause it don't hurt.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
But if I do it with my right foot, then I'm hopping.

DOCTOR N303
I'm going to have you continue with the tramadol, the one that you have.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
Only because, I'm kind of afraid to put you on another medication because you have that kidney, that creatinine level bumped up. I am going to have you check your creatinine level in like maybe a week.

PATIENT N303
Alright.

DOCTOR N303
We’ll see where it is.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
And if it goes down we'll have to put you on something else.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
And we'll try to figure it out that way.  And you need to lose weight and I know you have been right?

PATIENT N303
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR N303
Um are you in the MOVE Program at all?

PATIENT N303
What?

DOCTOR N303
The MOVE Program.

PATIENT N303
What's that?

DOCTOR N303
Oh you don't know about the MOVE Program?  It's this program that's for anyone that's interested in losing weight.  There's this program that is tailored to the individual and you get to work out and eat the way that they would like you too and it's pretty impressive what they do there.

PATIENT N303
They feed you?

DOCTOR N303
I don't know if they feed you, they kind of give you advice on how to go about what you should eat.

PATIENT N303
Cause a lot of time I'm cooking for myself so I eat a lot of yogurt um, I eat a lot of lunch meat.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
And I eat a lot of oatmeal.

DOCTOR N303
Oh really.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.  Instant oatmeal.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
I eat a lot of that.  I have three bowls in the morning or if I don’t have that I have eggs.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  

PATIENT N303
You know.

DOCTOR N303
But do you workout?

PATIENT N303
Um no but I ride my motor, I guess I you know I lift my motorcycle tires when I'm changing them and stuff like that.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  Well I think you should definitely do the MOVE Program though.  I think that might be a good way of like trying to lose weight.  I know you're doing the losing weight on your own.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
I think you would benefit.  They way, your knee pain, your back pain, all that will go away on its own.

PATIENT N303
Yeah my, my back doesn't hurt as much as it used to.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
And I can walk straighter.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
But I'm still out of breath a lot.  So I won't get up and walk a lot.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
Just cause after a little while of walking I start limping.

DOCTOR N303
So do you want to be part of the MOVE Program?

PATIENT N303
I don't know if I really have time for this.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
I have a lot of responsibilities with the club and stuff like that and they keep me pretty busy.  

DOCTOR N303
What club?

PATIENT N303
The SEAGULLs.  Motorcycle Club.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  I've got everything down.  We talked about that.  So tell me about the shortness of breath.  So um what's going on?  When do you get short of breath?

PATIENT N303
Walking.

DOCTOR N303
Walking?  How much do you walk until you get short of breath?

PATIENT N303
Um from here to out of the building where the valet parking is.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
I'm wheezing pretty good by then.

DOCTOR N303
You're wheezing.

PATIENT N303
I'm pretty short of breath.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  And how many blocks can you walk?

PATIENT N303
Well it used to be not even a half a block and I would be, so I'm walking further now.

DOCTOR N303
Oh you are?

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
Since you lost weight.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  So you're walking farther since you lost weight.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
So you used to walk like maybe half a block and now you're walking at least a block?

PATIENT N303
Yeah.  I can walk over a block.  I think that's over a block.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
And sometimes it's better than others.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
I went to the bike show and I walked through that whole thing, I didn't.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
I hardly hurt at all but other times it's walking half a mile to get in the place and I was really hobbling you know, it's like and my hip really, really, really hurt you know.  Okay so it seemed like maybe, my knee maybe it is getting better now.

DOCTOR N303
So um is it the pain that makes you stop or is it the shortness of breath that makes you stop walking?

PATIENT N303
Pain.

DOCTOR N303
So you can walk farther if you didn't have pain?

PATIENT N303
Probably.

DOCTOR N303
It's not the shortness of breath that's preventing you from walking.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
Okay so when do you get short of breath?  Do you ever get short of breath or is it just the pain that limits you?

PATIENT N303
Um, I'll make a mental note of this.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  Alright so if you're not huffing and puffing then that means it's not the shortness of breath that limits you.

PATIENT N303
Well I'm always, I'm always, always I don't know.  I'll write this down.

DOCTOR N303
Alright.  But I'll send you in for a pulmonary function test.

PATIENT N303
Okay.

DOCTOR N303
Uh but you do notice wheezing when you're walking?

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
You do notice.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.  I notice when I'm laying down I wheeze.

DOCTOR N303
More than you do when you're upright.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
Okay did you sleep with extra pillows or anything?

PATIENT N303
I got a third pillow I use, yeah.

DOCTOR N303
Okay do you find that you're gonna wake up in the middle of the night gasping for air?

PATIENT N303
No.

DOCTOR N303
Do you find that even when you get the pillows or something like that is this at night when you're laying flat?

PATIENT N303
Yep.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.  And it's once or twice a week you use the inhaler?

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
And it goes away.

PATIENT N303
Yeah that, I hardly use it at all.

DOCTOR N303
Okay, so I'm going to put in a consult in for the pulmonary function tests.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
To make sure that we take care of that.

PATIENT N303
Right.

DOCTOR N303
We would like to see, now you do smoke, that's a little concerning.  You've been losing weight.  Any night sweats or chills that you've noticed recently?

PATIENT N303
Chills?  No.

DOCTOR N303
Night sweats?  

PATIENT N303
No.

DOCTOR N303
Weight loss well unintentional loss?

PATIENT N303
No, not unintentional.  My weight loss now is because I'm trying and I've been trying.

DOCTOR N303
What did you do again to lose weight?

PATIENT N303
Uh I'm back on all the garbage food.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
You know but I live by myself now you know.

DOCTOR N303
So what did you eat?

PATIENT N303
Before I'd eat greasy hamburgers and fried chicken.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
I don't eat that.  I don't hardly eat bread.  Um if I have a sandwich I make half a sandwich with a lot more meat.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N303
You know um.  I don't know.

DOCTOR N303
Okay.

PATIENT N303
And then my girlfriend when she comes out, she cooks.  She is diabetic so she has to watch what she eats so I think that's where it ended up helping me because.

DOCTOR N303
Oh for the last year or so you've lost probably like 20 pounds.

PATIENT N303
Yeah.

DOCTOR N303
So that's good.

PATIENT N303
It went up faster than that.  It seemed like in one week I went three, four pant sizes when I quit working.

DOCTOR N303
Uh-huh.  

PATIENT N303
And could they get hold of, I know they always call me on the phone.

DOCTOR N303

DOCTOR N303
You can follow that.

PATIENT N303
Yeah okay that's what I'm going to start doing on this.  I'll do that today when I get home.
