DOCTOR G696
Really.

PATIENT G696
You know.

DOCTOR G696
It’s a bunch of sperm.

PATIENT G696
Um yeah, no.

DOCTOR G696
When did they say it was? That’s what the note says.

PATIENT G696
It says that?

DOCTOR G696
Yeah what did they say it is?

PATIENT G696
That's not what they told me.  They said it was a uh a uh.

DOCTOR G696
An abscess?

PATIENT G696
Not a cyst but something on my sperm delivery system.  What else, it's a liposil thing.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah it is a cyst.

PATIENT G696
Okay.

DOCTOR G696
Because a cyst is basically liquid that's benign first of all.

PATIENT G696
Yeah.

DOCTOR G696
You don't have to worry about anything serious there um but it can be filled with either like water um, it can blocked up sperm, is why it's filled up like that.  In either case I know that they had offered @@@.  If they offered to lump it off.

PATIENT G696
No they didn't.  They said that that would be elective surgery. I can’t afford that.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah, yeah. That’s the thing, that's the thing so um did they say they wanted to follow up with you though?

PATIENT G696
No.

DOCTOR G696
Okay.  There's no way you can maybe talk to Social Work to see you can get this done?

PATIENT G696
Oh I don't know I mean I tried to talk to the social worker and then everybody at the Urology Clinic told me oh I don't know who to call.

DOCTOR G696
Oh yeah, that’s the thing.  You know we have, I think its Financial Services or something like that that may be able to help you out with this.  I know it's an elective surgery.

PATIENT G696
I mean like right now, right now I have, see I usually pay all my VA bills.

DOCTOR G696
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G696
There's my taxes, I’m gonna get my taxes and I mean I haven't paid since last April so I got all the prescriptions and all the doctors and I got extra doctor visits in here.

DOCTOR G696
Right.

PATIENT G696
Because of my problem.

DOCTOR G696
Right.  I know, I know.

PATIENT G696
So the VA bill is getting kind of big.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah right.

PATIENT G696
So I mean I could probably stand to see the social worker just @@@.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah that's not a bad idea.  I mean let me see if I can have them talk to you and see if they can help out.  Um how have you been otherwise?  

PATIENT G696
Um.

DOCTOR G696
Have you been doing okay?

PATIENT G696

DOCTOR G696

PATIENT G696
Well I've been off of it for a week and it's not going very good at all.  So I want to get back on it.

DOCTOR G696

DOCTOR G696

PATIENT G696
Oh okay.

DOCTOR G696
So if you still want to get it it is in there.

PATIENT G696
Okay cause I didn't see my name on the board so maybe, maybe they were still getting the dose.  Did you drop them off today?

DOCTOR G696

PATIENT G696
Thank you.  

DOCTOR G696
Yeah you should be able to get it.

PATIENT G696

PATIENT G696
Oh okay.

DOCTOR G696

DOCTOR G696
Well I would still call.

PATIENT G696

DOCTOR G696
Cause it's your pain.

PATIENT G696
Yeah.

DOCTOR G696
So um, I'm not the one in pain so sometimes I'm not @@@.

DOCTOR G696

DOCTOR G696
What happened?

PATIENT G696
I took all the stuff.  I sat on the toilet all night.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah.

PATIENT G696
And then in my morning my wife was feeling so terrible and she couldn’t take me and I went through the worst part of it.

DOCTOR G696
The worst part of it is the prep.

PATIENT G696
Yeah I went through the worst part of it and then I couldn't go.

DOCTOR G696
I read the note and went, “No!”@@@ procedure.Okay, they said they are still willing to do it. Do you want it?

PATIENT G696
Yeah, yeah.  I gotta have it done. I mean the stuff.  My father had.

DOCTOR G696
Your father had colon cancer?

PATIENT G696
Yeah.

DOCTOR G696
Oh goodness and you're 58 okay.  So we'll do it sometime.

PATIENT G696
I mean I haven't had one for sort of like five years at least.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah, well you've had one before?

PATIENT G696
Yeah.  Not here.

DOCTOR G696
Oh @@@ it wasn't here.  That's right @@@ yeah.  Um okay so I'll put that back in.

PATIENT G696
Yeah.

DOCTOR G696
Put it back in.  What else we got going on here?  Uh, oh they want some other stuff here.  Um, flu shot, do you have one?

PATIENT G696
I had them both.

DOCTOR G696
Yep, yep, @@@ good.  And your cholesterol is very good I'm not going to recheck that.  @@@.

PATIENT G696
43?

DOCTOR G696
Yes.  @@@.

PATIENT G696
I know.  I've been active all of my life and it's low enough for me.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah definitely, definitely.  Your sugars are very well controlled too.

PATIENT G696
Are they?

DOCTOR G696
Yeah.  I want to take a look at you.

PATIENT G696
In spite of the doctor, I mean @@@ for sleep.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah I have a number from 2009 um that tells me what it's been in the last three months in 2009 and you've been well controlled.

PATIENT G696
Okay.

DOCTOR G696
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep what you're doing up, cause you know keep watching your diet and watching out for fat thing @@@ that kind of thing because as long as you have @@@ that makes your heart is working well.

PATIENT G696
Yeah.

DOCTOR G696
You know.  Lean forward for me, deep breath, good, breathe, breathe, out and in, out.  You know this is the hardest thing to talk about how's the smoking going?

PATIENT G696
I'm thinking of quitting.  I have actually am.

DOCTOR G696
Are you there yet?

PATIENT G696
This new tax @@@ you know this is @@@.

DOCTOR G696
@@@.

PATIENT G696
Yeah.

DOCTOR G696
First of all you'd save a lot of money um you know.

PATIENT G696
I don't want to do the classes Thursday because it's too far for me to drive.

DOCTOR G696
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G696
You know and with me on a limited income uh I can't afford to come over here.

DOCTOR G696
Okay.

PATIENT G696
Two or three times a week.

DOCTOR G696
Okay.  The first question is though do you want to quit?  If you don't, I can't really talk much more.  I can tell you why you should quit and maybe that would convince you.

PATIENT G696
I've been thinking in the last week yes.

DOCTOR G696
Uh-huh.  Okay, okay.  Um, well the important thing is you know you're quitting.  I can't stress to you, you have such real disease with your legs and all that kind of thing.  Smoking only exacerbates these problems and adds more problems.  Smoking one of the things it does in terms of your legs is it clamps down your vessels and when you walk it gives you even more pain in your vessels there.

PATIENT G696
Okay.

DOCTOR G696
The blood can’t get to them and then now I don't know what the pain comes from, especially. Lung cancer.  I'm sure you know about that.  The chance of lung cancer is dramatically higher than normal people.  Other disease is called COPD, an obstructive problem.  I don't know if you get @@@ when you walk around at all.

PATIENT G696
No.

DOCTOR G696
Okay.

PATIENT G696
I've been walking all my life.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah.

PATIENT G696
And it doesn't bother me.

DOCTOR G696
So if you do any activities or anything a or have a cough or @@@ okay so that's probably a bronchitis type of thing.  Um so not only the heart disease, hypertension, kidney disease, stroke all these things are increased with smoking.  I can’t tell you the importance of smoking.  I can't emphasize that enough.  What you can try to do is, if you're willing to quit.  You have to be realistic.  How much you smoke a day?

PATIENT G696
A pack.

DOCTOR G696
Um do you want to try nicotine patches or the gum?

PATIENT G696
No but my wife said that that's the only thing that ever worked for her.

DOCTOR G696
There's multiple things you can try the patches, you could try the gum, you could try the lozenges, you can try Chantix, but the first in the line of things is to try nicotine replacement.  So you could start with the patch.  I'll give a two week trial of the patch okay and by the end of the two weeks you should be stopped.  Now that's a lofty goal, that's a lofty goal okay.  Cessation of smoking is the only way to do this but let’s try to do the patch okay.  See if you can cut down from a pack to like a half pack.  Something like that and then you'll eventually get down to none, okay.

PATIENT G696
My first of the cigarette of the day @@@ bother me.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah.

PATIENT G696
You know and it's just getting to the point I need to quit.

DOCTOR G696
I think that you'll find that you'll save a bunch of money.  You'll feel much better okay and things you don't notice are things that you're body's reacting to.  Your heart will be better.  Your blood vessels will get better once you've quit.  So you want to try to do the patch?

PATIENT G696
Sure.

DOCTOR G696
Okay let's give it a try.  Let me know. Uh I'll be honest you know you give it your best go.  People relapse all the time. Sometimes it doesn’t work or if people do quit they start smoking again.  It's kind of a lifelong thing but I'm sure this guy will stop.  The last thing I'd like to do here is you have a little bit of a cough @@@ short of breath.  I'd like to get some lung studies on you.  Have you ever heard of anything called pulmonary function tests?

PATIENT G696
Yeah.

DOCTOR G696
Okay.  Have you ever done the tests?

PATIENT G696
Yeah but where they wrap your legs.

DOCTOR G696
No, no, no it's not that.  That's just uh, I don't think you've done a pulmonary function tests before.  This is where they make you blow into a machine and they test how big your, what your lung volumes are and that kind of stuff.

PATIENT G696
Oh I've done that before.

DOCTOR G696
Oh have you?  Well I just, yeah let me take a look here.

PATIENT G696
Not here.

DOCTOR G696
Oh, like somewhere else.

PATIENT G696
They used to do that with us yearly when I worked for a paper company up north.

DOCTOR G696
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G696
And then they would do it yearly when I worked for the power company down in Madison.

DOCTOR G696
Okay.

PATIENT G696
So this was you know like 16 years ago.

DOCTOR G696
I gotcha.  Let me order that for you, see what they show.

PATIENT G696
Sure.

DOCTOR G696
Okay good.  And we'll see what else, I'll see if I can talk to the social worker for you and maybe set up a meeting.  Okay, let me talk to my attending and I'll be right back with you.

PATIENT G696
Great.

DOCTOR G696
What have you got?

PATIENT G696
No, well kind uh.  @@@.  I have my name on here @@@ you can sign it or not.  This is so that I can drive, so I can get insurance to drive.  Now before they would let me drive, when I was up here last year.

DOCTOR G696
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G696
Before they would let me drive again they gave me a test and I passed the test with flying colors.  When I was on the pain medication, now I don't know.

DOCTOR G696
Why are they making you do this?

PATIENT G696
Uh I told them that I wasn't working anymore and that I was on disability.

DOCTOR G696
Oh.

PATIENT G696
And they said then what kind of medicines are you taking and when I said morphine they said well okay then you got to fill this out.

DOCTOR G696
Oh really?  @@@ okay.

PATIENT G696
@@@.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah so you're not going to know what that means.

PATIENT G696
Spinal stenosis.

DOCTOR G696
No @@@ spinal stenosis.

PATIENT G696
@@@.  Smokers @@@.

DOCTOR G696
@@@ they're not going to know what that is either.  @@@. Life long.  Medications morphine oral uh, 15 mgs. COPD, hypertension.  @@@.  Oh you're taking it four times a day.

PATIENT G696
Four.

DOCTOR G696
Every four hours.  @@@.  

PATIENT G696
I don't know @@@. 

DOCTOR G696
@@@ optomistrist @@@.

PATIENT G696
No.

DOCTOR G696
Oh, good.  I'll be right back.

PATIENT G696
Okay.

DOCTOR G696
Now, I never asked you how is that mass doing, any pain?

PATIENT G696
It's a pain.

DOCTOR G696
@@@.

PATIENT G696
Yeah.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah. 

PATIENT G696
Well it really hasn't gotten any larger.  The largest it was was when it got to a certain size when I came in to see you, I mean right around that area @@@.

DOCTOR G696
@@@ peak.

PATIENT G696
And it peaked @@@.

DOCTOR G696
Okay.

(DOCTOR 27:55  DOCTOR IN:  32:38)

DOCTOR G696
Okay, I just to kind of to summarize over what we're going to do for you a few things um, I want reorder the C-Scope and I'll have them call you about that.  I'm going to order nicotine patch and you'll get the morphine and you can pick that up too.  Uh again it's once a day for two weeks.

PATIENT G696
Okay.

DOCTOR G696
So hopefully you'll be down quite a bit by that time but if you don't take @@@ but if we have a realistic goal of cutting down by our next visit, @@@ every little bit.

PATIENT G696
Okay.

DOCTOR G696
Okay.  Uh and the last is the pulmonary function tests also they'll call you about @@@.

PATIENT G696
Uh I have one more @@@.  That terazosin.

DOCTOR G696
Terazosin?

PATIENT G696
Terazosin.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah.

PATIENT G696
For my bladder, my.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah.

PATIENT G696
The guy downstairs ordered that for me.

DOCTOR G696
Uh-huh, yeah I see that.

PATIENT G696
And uh it makes me feel groggy so I stopped taking it.

DOCTOR G696
Okay did it affect your bladder now or how have you done with that?

PATIENT G696
You know it didn't really make any difference.

DOCTOR G696
In the first place?

PATIENT G696
Yeah.  I started on that and they gave me this regimen, it was supposed to last more or less, I don't know two or three week's total.

DOCTOR G696
Right.

PATIENT G696
Whatever.

DOCTOR G696
Oh they started you in the GU Clinic.

PATIENT G696
Yeah.

DOCTOR G696
Okay.

PATIENT G696
And uh I went to the first, I through the whole carton; it didn't seem to make that much difference except it made me feel sleepy all the time.

DOCTOR G696
Yeah.  Okay that's fine and why don't you mention that when you see them again.  Cause you're the one saying you're going to see them again.  I want you again colonoscopy, PFTs, get the @@@.  The other thing for you is that I want you to sit outside, I had the social worker contacted and she's going to talk to you about some stuff okay.  I think you should have the surgery and the VA, even though elective, should cover it and you'd have to probably pay some sort of a small co-pay on top of it but in terms of the surgery it's not going to be that expensive for you okay, @@@.  So why don't you talk to her though okay and @@@.  In the meantime, if you're doing much better why don't we see each other in six months okay?

PATIENT G696
Okay.

DOCTOR G696
And you can get that scheduled up front but first sit here and @@@.

PATIENT G696
Okay.

DOCTOR G696
Good to see you.

PATIENT G696
Thanks a lot doc.  You know there's a @@@ that reminds of @@@.

DOCTOR G696
@@@.

PATIENT G696
@@@.  Okay thank you.
