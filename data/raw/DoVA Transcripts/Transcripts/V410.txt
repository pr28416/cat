DOCTOR V410
No, @@@ since last time.  Um okay so let's see.  Last time I saw you I wanted to get your three month average of your sugars checked.  Um and did you forget to go to the Lab, do you know what happened?

DOCTOR V410
Right after we're done.

PATIENT V410
Yeah.

DOCTOR V410
Um and you've been checking your sugars at home?

PATIENT V410
Yeah I have.  Uh I have a problem in the evening and I don't know why.

DOCTOR V410
What kind, what's wrong?

PATIENT V410
It shoots up in the evening.

DOCTOR V410
It shoots up in the evening but okay, last time I thought you were only checking, you were only taking your insulin if your sugar was high, is that right?

PATIENT V410
No I take it twice a day.

DOCTOR V410
You take it twice a day?

PATIENT V410
Yeah.

DOCTOR V410
Do you remember telling me that last time?  You check your sugar, the blood glucose twice a day but do you take um, last time you were only taking your insulin if your sugar was high or you take your insulin twice a day no matter what?

PATIENT V410
No matter what.  I might have said uh I take it uh you know you supposed to take it and then eat, I flipped, if it's less than 140 something, I eat before I take it, otherwise it'll drop down too low.

DOCTOR V410
Oh, okay I must have misunderstood you then.

PATIENT V410
Yeah I uh.

DOCTOR V410
So you are taking the NPH right?  The insulin NPH?

PATIENT V410
Yeah.

DOCTOR V410
And you take how many units in the morning?

PATIENT V410
Uh 15 uh the milky stuff and the clear 10 and at night its 22.

DOCTOR V410
Hmm.

PATIENT V410
The milky stuff and 10 of the clear.

DOCTOR V410
Okay.

PATIENT V410
But uh, didnâ€™t you tell me, I set it up, unless it's 140 something if I take the insulin I can feel my sugar dropping but uh it wouldn't work that fast.

DOCTOR V410
Uh-huh.  Um your sugars look pretty good.

PATIENT V410
Did you see those 200s in the evening?

DOCTOR V410
I see a 107, I see 200s, a couple of them but not all the time.

PATIENT V410
No.

DOCTOR V410
It seemed that the lowest you ever had was 70s.

PATIENT V410
No 65, I had a 65 in the morning.  If it, even November and December.  That's one thing, a couple things, well I been trying to lose some weight so I try eating some small amount at night but then I wake up in the night and I you know I see a different color, my sugar be low because uh I see the color around lights.

DOCTOR V410
Gotcha.  I think we need to change around your dosing like maybe you take more in the morning and less at night.  Cause your night will affect your morning sugar and your morning insulin will affect your night sugar.  See what I'm saying?

PATIENT V410
Yeah.

DOCTOR V410
When it's 60 do you feel bad?

PATIENT V410
In the morning no.

DOCTOR V410
Any fevers or chills?

PATIENT V410
No.

DOCTOR V410
Um any change in weight?

PATIENT V410
That's what bugs me.  I can't, I'm not losing any.

DOCTOR V410
Are you exercising?

PATIENT V410
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR V410
Do you want to, have you heard of the MOVE Program?

PATIENT V410
What's that?

DOCTOR V410
It's a program that'll help you lose weight.

PATIENT V410
Oh do you mean here?

DOCTOR V410
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V410
I don't see how.  I don't see how.

DOCTOR V410
It's uh yeah it deals with talking about your diet and exercises and things like that.

PATIENT V410
Yeah, the problem see I don't do the cooking.

DOCTOR V410
Who cooks?

PATIENT V410
My wife.

DOCTOR V410
So she has to get the education.

PATIENT V410
Yeah but she cook what she wants to.

DOCTOR V410
Does she have diabetes?

PATIENT V410
Yeah.  She had it about five or six years before I got it.

DOCTOR V410
Okay and she's not cooking.

PATIENT V410
Nope.

DOCTOR V410
Do you think you could help her cook and you guys could make different foods?

PATIENT V410
Help her cook?

DOCTOR V410
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V410
No, no, that's not my bag, cooking, but she, hers go down too at night.  She gets up just about every night.

DOCTOR V410
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V410
Cause her sugar being @@@.

DOCTOR V410
So it seems like both of you, who does she see?  Who's her doctor?

PATIENT V410
Uh I think its DOCTOR from the Mercy Hospital @@@.

DOCTOR V410
Hmm.

PATIENT V410
Well her regular doctor retired so this is a new one.

DOCTOR V410
Okay, so what can we do to get her to cook differently?

PATIENT V410
(Laughs) I don't know, whether I talk with her again.  And uh the other problem about, you know vegetables and fruits and all that stuff.

DOCTOR V410
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V410
Uh, uh, back, way back when, when I was younger I messed my teeth up now I can't eat no fruit and stuff.  They say all of them gonna go out.

DOCTOR V410
Okay.

PATIENT V410
So I can't uh.

DOCTOR V410
Well it's not what you're, it's not necessarily what you're eating it's how much you're eating.  I mean obviously what you're eating matters to you but even if you're not eating fruits and vegetables you shouldn't be eating fatty foods and that seems like the problem right?

PATIENT V410
Oh.

DOCTOR V410
At home.

PATIENT V410
Might be too much I don't know.  But uh, but the doctor when he put me on that inhalant.

DOCTOR V410
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V410
Inhalant in this can cause you to gain weight right?  That's what I was told.

DOCTOR V410
No the insulin can cause you to gain weight but nothing you are, the prednisone that can cause you to gain weight.

PATIENT V410
Well one of them got steroid in it.

DOCTOR V410
Yeah but it's not steroid that goes to your whole body, it's just localized to get to your lungs.  That was just in a pill that that's you know.

PATIENT V410
So that shouldn't cause anything.

DOCTOR V410
Uh uh. Real quick, any chest pain or trouble breathing?

PATIENT V410
No.

DOCTOR V410
Any cough?

PATIENT V410
Yeah I got a dry cough.

DOCTOR V410
Yeah you had that last time.  Nausea, vomiting, blood in your stool, black stools?

PATIENT V410
None.

DOCTOR V410
Okay.  Um we definitely need to work on your sugars.  I want to see what your three month average is so we will send you to the Lab; I want to do the lab right after this okay.

PATIENT V410
Yes.

DOCTOR V410
Um and then is your phone number NUMBER?

PATIENT V410
Yeah.

DOCTOR V410

PATIENT V410
Yeah.

DOCTOR V410
Why don't you have a seat up here, take your coat off, I'm gonna take a listen to your heart.

PATIENT V410
What they gonna check today?  I been eating all day.

DOCTOR V410
It's your three-month average of your sugar so it's not gonna matter what you ate today; it's an average of everything for the past three months.

PATIENT V410
Take this off, shirt off too?

DOCTOR V410
No that's okay.  Take a deep breath.  Are you smoking still?

PATIENT V410

DOCTOR V410
Open your mouth, okay you can close.  Can you put your arm straight up?  Don't let me push down.  And you said you quit September the 9th?

PATIENT V410
Not this September, over a year ago.

DOCTOR V410
Oh great, great, great.  Okay.  You can come up and have a seat here and I see that you saw the podiatrist and the eye doctor since I saw you last right?

PATIENT V410
Yeah.

DOCTOR V410
Okay, it looks like you're up to date on everything.  

PATIENT V410
You mean on my medicine and I can make an order before I come back.

DOCTOR V410

PATIENT V410
I can order something before I come back here, before my next appointment?

DOCTOR V410
Like your medications?

PATIENT V410

DOCTOR V410

PATIENT V410
What that eye doctor told me,it was false.

DOCTOR V410
What was false?

PATIENT V410
She didn't put it in the system.

DOCTOR V410
Yeah I gave you six refills on everything.

PATIENT V410
Oh okay.

DOCTOR V410
Uh a year of refills you have on a lot of these things.

PATIENT V410
Okay then.

DOCTOR V410
So all of my medicines that I give you will have refills and then the ones that aren't I'm changing right now.  Do you want to pick them up here or send them to your house?

PATIENT V410
What?  Wonder whether I need them, I'm okay right now.

DOCTOR V410
Okay.  Okay I'll visit with DOCTOR and I'll be back okay.  I'll run this by him.

(DOCTOR OUT:  47:58  DOCTOR IN:  53:20)

DOCTOR V410
Okay sir, so we talked about everything and it looks like right now like I said we're gonna leave what you're doing with your insulin um and then we're gonna check your three month average okay.  If the three-month average looks good, you're not having lows that I'm worried about.  You said the lowest it's ever been is 65 right?

PATIENT V410
Yeah.

DOCTOR V410
So that's okay.  If you're having a lot of lows and you start feeling symptoms like the shaking and feeling like you're gonna pass out then I'm worried okay.  So you're doing fine.  You've got to work on the diet.  I know it's hard because you said your wife is the one that cooks but you really want to talk to her about it too cause it'll help both of you in the long run okay.

PATIENT V410
Okay.

DOCTOR V410
Um so I'll see you back, I won't see you back for another six months.  Everything is renewed so I'm gonna check your kidney function too since it's been about a year since it was checked so um the order's in so I'll have you go back to the Lab okay and I'll call you if we need to change anything.

PATIENT V410
Okay.  Now what's your name?

DOCTOR V410
Huh?

PATIENT V410

DOCTOR V410
Oh DOCTOR is my last name.

PATIENT V410
