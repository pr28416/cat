PATIENT K673
Well I uh, somebody scheduled me an appointment and that's all I know.

DOCTOR K673

PATIENT K673
And I can tell you what's wrong.

DOCTOR K673
Alright sounds good.

PATIENT K673
Um it's a little, little muscle there.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.

PATIENT K673
It used to be the size of a football right here and now it's just like here right now.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.

PATIENT K673
I think the more I exercise the more it go down.

DOCTOR K673
Oh really.

PATIENT K673
See what happens, I come into the hospital and had a low blood count.

DOCTOR K673
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K673
So they took a bone biopsy right here.

DOCTOR K673
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K673
That paralyzed me all the way down.  So I can't walk right now.  You know I got a walker at home and uh this knee here, where it's got a pin in it, it give me a lot of, it give me a lot of trouble right here in this knee.  It's giving me a lot of trouble.

DOCTOR K673
Uh when did you get the pin in it?

PATIENT K673
Oh.

DOCTOR K673
It's been a while?

PATIENT K673
About 7 years.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.

PATIENT K673
And uh you know the hip, see when I'm trying, like if I want to try to get from here to that desk.

DOCTOR K673
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K673
This will give me a problem and then my hip would give me a problem you know.

DOCTOR K673
And that's what limiting your abilty to move around?

PATIENT K673
Right.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.  See what the uh, looks like, excuse me; you had been in rehab for a little while.

PATIENT K673
In what?

DOCTOR K673
They had been in rehab for a little while.

PATIENT K673
Yeah just a couple three times downstairs. Oh I got to ask you to get me reinstated for the rehab because they're calling me and when they call me I can't get to the phone so three calls they don't call me no more.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.

PATIENT K673
They told me I had to get you to reinstate me.

DOCTOR K673
Alright I can put in another consult for that.  Excuse me.  Um just about done, I need a drink of water real quick.

PATIENT K673
Alright.

DOCTOR K673
To clear my throat.  (Doctor leaves for less than a minute to get some water).  I'm sorry about that.  

PATIENT K673
Alright.

DOCTOR K673
Alright so.  Let's start with your, with your knee and your hip.

PATIENT K673
Right.

DOCTOR K673
Then we can, we'll take a look at it again today and we'll make sure we get you back in place with physical therapy.

PATIENT K673
Alright.

DOCTOR K673
Uh what else has been going on?

PATIENT K673
Oh nothing I just kind of haven't had very much of an appetite but I'm gonna have to work on that you know.

DOCTOR K673
Okay, over what time period did that change?  How long have you noticed that your appetite's low.

PATIENT K673
Well every since I come here in the hospital.  The day I come into the hospital I couldn't eat when I was here.  I weighed 194 pounds and now I'm down to 164.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.

PATIENT K673
So uh when I left the hospital I weighed 174.  Since I've been home I haven't been eating but I got to make some more eating arrangements.  

DOCTOR K673
Okay, alright.  Um so I think uh vitamin supplements to take would be a good idea.

PATIENT K673
Right.

DOCTOR K673
And uh take in whatever you can.

PATIENT K673
Right.

DOCTOR K673
Um definitely good for keeping your energy level up.  Sometimes if you feel more energy you tend to eat more.  It's just kind of a, once it gets going it should help for.

PATIENT K673
Right.

DOCTOR K673
Wanting you to feel like eating.  Um so it looks like if I'm reading everything correctly uh, so I read about your hospitalizations and the rehab.  So then you had a blood, like sort of a hematoma or a big bruise that developed after the biopsy is that what?

PATIENT K673
Well I don't know, you talking about this?

DOCTOR K673
Yeah.

PATIENT K673
Well actually this was like a football, way like this.

DOCTOR K673
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K673
Now it just back of my hand like this.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.  Yeah that was blood there and that's a good thing.  If that was muscle not as good of a thing so.

PATIENT K673
Yeah I don't know.

DOCTOR K673
I think it probably, from what it sounds like; it was a big hematoma or blood clot that formed there.

PATIENT K673
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K673
And so then your body's slowly going to re-absorb that.

PATIENT K673
Right.  Cause you know since I been trying to get around, you know I been walking with two walking sticks.

DOCTOR K673
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K673
And I got a walker.  So uh I'm doing better.

DOCTOR K673
Okay good.

PATIENT K673
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K673
Um and it looks like next week you have an appointment with the hematologist.

PATIENT K673

DOCTOR K673

PATIENT K673
No, no, the GI tomorrow.

DOCTOR K673
Yeah the 13th.

PATIENT K673
Okay.

DOCTOR K673

PATIENT K673
Okay.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.  Let's see if I can find the report here.  Okay.

DOCTOR K673
No problem.  Alright.  So other than the uh pain in your hip and your knee um is there any other thing that's bothered you?

PATIENT K673
No.

DOCTOR K673
No.  Have you been feeling like dizzy when you stand up, that sort of thing?

PATIENT K673
No I was feeling woozy today because I haven't eaten nothing too much.  I ate half of a cheese sandwich, cheese grilled cheese and I ate a honey bun a while ago.  I think and I didn't take all my blood pressure medicines.  But otherwise than that, I been alright.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.  I'm just going to write a few of these things out so I don't forget.  Uh.

PATIENT K673

DOCTOR K673
Okay.  Have you seen them?

PATIENT K673

PATIENT K673
Trying to walk yeah.  No I don't have no pain, just when I try to walk, you know you can feel it and all this, you know is numb like.  I got feelings; see now like if you didn't have no feelings and the feeling come back in it, well that's its like.

DOCTOR K673

PATIENT K673

DOCTOR K673
Okay.

PATIENT K673

DOCTOR K673
Alright.  Okay.  Well uh and that's somewhat improved from whenever you had the biopsy done?

PATIENT K673

DOCTOR K673
Okay.  Well hopefully that'll continue to improve and I hope physical therapy would be able to get some. 

PATIENT K673

PATIENT K673
Alright uh-huh.

DOCTOR K673
Um.  So your hemoglobin last week was good, it was 9 1/2, about where it had been.

PATIENT K673

And let's see when the last time we checked your cholesterol was, a couple weeks ago.

PATIENT K673
(Patient belches.) Excuse me.

DOCTOR K673
Yes.  And I don't see your A1c.  It was last checked in April, 5.7 so it was excellent.  I got to talk to the boss um and uh we'll get you back to therapy and make sure all your medications are up-to-date and uh I think that'll probably about do you for now, so I'll run everything by him and I'll be back in a little bit.

PATIENT K673
Alright, alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  153:4  DOCTOR IN:  170:29)

DOCTOR K673
Sorry about the wait.

PATIENT K673
It's alright.

DOCTOR K673
I had to wade through a lot of your records uh with the boss.  Um but I think we have a pretty good plan.  Your blood pressure is still a little bit elevated today so we're gonna start you on a low dose of lisinopril.  We're going to start you on lisinopril um furosemide or Lasix.

PATIENT K673
I got enough high blood pressure medicine, I just didn't take it.

DOCTOR K673
Oh you just didn't take it?

PATIENT K673
Yeah that why I come expecting that. (Dr. is interrupted.)  How you doing.  See I think it's hard for me to get dressed.

DOCTOR K673
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K673
So I @@@ up so I didn't have time to eat or nothing so what I did, cause I was sick last night so I didn't, I just fell asleep this morning so I took, what is that, start with the I uh, no nifedipine.

DOCTOR K673
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K673
So if I take what I got I'll be alright.

DOCTOR K673
Okay yeah I was confused.  I thought you said that you grabbed a sandwich so you could take your medicine.

PATIENT K673
I did but that was after I was on my way here.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.  So you didn't have all your medications today.

PATIENT K673
No I grabbed the one, I ate half of a sandwich and I took that medication in the car.

DOCTOR K673
Okay.  Alright well that makes me feel a little bit better about where things are.

PATIENT K673

PATIENT K673
Yeah you know @@@ nifedipine 120 and I got another one that's 100, that's a lot of pills.

DOCTOR K673
