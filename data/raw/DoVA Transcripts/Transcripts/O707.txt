DOCTOR O707
@@@.

PATIENT O707
Okay.  So the one I say you got an order on that right?  

DOCTOR O707
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O707
Okay.

DOCTOR O707
I'm typing it in right now.

PATIENT O707
Alright.

DOCTOR O707
And tell me what you've been doing with your diet.

PATIENT O707
I've been, I've been trying to get those 3 1/2 meals.  I'm trying to get always three in.  Sometimes I can get it in and sometime I can't but I'm going to the gym every day.  I don't know it just don't feeling like the weight wanna come off.  It don't, it's just I don't understand it you know.  And the more I work out, it like it just stays.  You think I got a ulcer or something cause they had to put me.  I had the stomach, one of them showing @@@.  Uh @@@ thing you gave me when they.

DOCTOR O707
The ultrasound?

PATIENT O707
Yeah it didn't show no abnormalness @@@.

DOCTOR O707
No are you having stomach pain?

PATIENT O707
No, I just can't understand why my stomach won't go down you know.  I'm doing sit-ups, I'm riding a bike and I don't know what's wrong with this thing.  I'm thinking I might have Crohn's disease or something.  I ain't got Crohn's disease do I?

DOCTOR O707
No, that usually makes people not gain weight but they have a lot of diarrhea and constipation.

PATIENT O707
But do they have big stomachs too?

DOCTOR O707
Not as much no.  Not the same in that, it all just comes out the other end.

PATIENT O707
@@@ see if they got that suction and the stomach stapling.  I got to have some help with this thing.  I know what I'm doing maybe it ain't working, it ain't working.  

DOCTOR O707
Do you feel like your pants are fitting loser or you're getting more muscle?

PATIENT O707
I well I'm getting more, I'm getting stronger, I'm getting stronger but some of my clothes uh getting lose you know.  I can see, sometimes I can lose, I feel like I losing inches you know and then but the weight is still there and like uh two weeks ago I weighed and I was 297.5, now this morning I'm 299, that pound and a half come from less than a week and a half, less than two weeks.  And I want you know, I don't know, I don't know.  It seems like it just, it's hard to take a deep breath of air, it'll turn to pounds.  

DOCTOR O707
I know some people will actually notice their weight will stay about the same or even go up if they start working out because muscle weighs more than fat.

PATIENT O707
As a matter of fact, I been training at the gym so I know all about that.  My thing is me, why I can't, I'm doing everything I think is possible to get rid of this stomach and it don't seem to be working you know.  I need help, I need, even if I gotta go somewhere else and see if they can do that uh stomach stapling or that liposuction.  

DOCTOR O707
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O707
I need something like that cause it would take me ten years if I could do it but this ain't working for me.

DOCTOR O707
Do you have any supplemental insurance on top of what the VA has for you?

PATIENT O707
No.

DOCTOR O707
Okay.  So if we look for something I'll try to, I'll ask the attending to see if they know if the procedures they do it here if you are eligible.

PATIENT O707
Right and it got to be a problem because it hinders my health you know.  It's not making me feel any better and uh and messing with my blood pressure, it got to be cause all of this weight and stuff you know so.  Just like you could recommend it.

DOCTOR O707
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O707
You know.  But it is interfering.

DOCTOR O707
@@@ ultrasound.

PATIENT O707
Okay.

DOCTOR O707
No fluid @@@ everything was just about the same as the last time it was done.

PATIENT O707
Yeah I don't know.  @@@.  I don't understand what's going on, what's going on.

DOCTOR O707
Gotcha.

PATIENT O707
Uh last week, I @@@ know anything about the gym and how to lifting weight and things.

DOCTOR O707
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O707
But I was, I squat 505 pounds, three reps.

DOCTOR O707
505?

PATIENT O707
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O707
That's a lot.

PATIENT O707
It is a lot but I'm getting stronger but I can't lose this stomach you know.  In that in the gym I lift weights, the cardiac machine, I'm constantly on it and I don't know.  I don't want to do it too much because your stomach would turn into muscle.

DOCTOR O707
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O707
You know then I'm just stuck with a big old muscle.

DOCTOR O707
@@@.

PATIENT O707
Yeah then it'd be out to here and I never would be able to give you a big old, like I got a six month baby stomach muscle but the fact is I can't get rid of it anyway because of the muscle you know.  I don't waht that, I don't know.  It's a dilemma for me.  You know, I don't and I can't and my clothes, I don't like the way I look in my clothes now.  Man, I don't look the same, my stomach.  I like I'm neat, I like to look good but this thing here causes a problem for me and see it ain't shaking my confidence cause I can deal with anything but I just don't like the way I look but I'm not gonna you know.  I don't know it's, it's a hassle.  I'm just, maybe I'm too vain but I don't want this stomach I know that.

DOCTOR O707
@@@.

PATIENT O707
Yeah.  You know I can't predict anything.  I'm working out hard and it's not working.

DOCTOR O707
Let me take a listen to your heart and lungs.

PATIENT O707
Okay sure.

DOCTOR O707
What kind of @@@.

PATIENT O707
Okay.

DOCTOR O707

DOCTOR O707

PATIENT O707
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  13:15  DOCTOR IN:  26:02)

PATIENT O707
I thought you had to deal with a Code Blue.

DOCTOR O707
@@@ where it was.  I think they announced like three different locations.

PATIENT O707
I thought they said Red Tower.

DOCTOR O707
They said it was in the Red Tower and then they said the Reception Center and then @@@.

PATIENT O707
Yeah but then they said something about @@@.

DOCTOR O707
Yeah we have a Code Team that will go.

PATIENT O707
Okay.

DOCTOR O707
DOCTOR went to find a prescription pad.

PATIENT O707
Okay.

DOCTOR O707
He'll be in shortly.

PATIENT O707
Alright.

DOCTOR O707
But we need, so I talked to him a little bit about what options that we have and unfortunately we don't have anyone who does liposuction here.

PATIENT O707
Did you check with Hines?

DOCTOR O707
Huh?

PATIENT O707
With Hines?

DOCTOR O707
I don't know cause we don't have anyone here that works at Hines.

PATIENT O707
Yeah but I can go to Hines and have it done because if Hines do it.

DOCTOR O707
If they have it.

PATIENT O707
Yeah but you gonna check, how you gonna check with Hines see if Hines handles it cause if you don't have doesn't mean Hines don't have it.

DOCTOR O707
No I mean I don't think the VA has this.

PATIENT O707
Oh, oh I gotcha.  Okay I see that would probably be some outside thing for me to do, okay.

DOCTOR O707
Yeah.

PATIENT O707
Alright.

DOCTOR O707
And then.

PATIENT O707
I got you, I understand.  Uh but you say you don't think VA has it so you really don't know.

DOCTOR O707
No we do have a VA Plastic Surgery section but they do more things like skin flaps or like reconstruction of someone's you know broken their hand and they need to cover the area that's not healing well.  I've never seen anyone there do anything like liposuction.

PATIENT O707
There's probably a first time for everything.

DOCTOR O707
No.

PATIENT O707
@@@ you know you never saw you have to ask them and see if, just if they do either.  You got to guess you know you not certain.

DOCTOR O707
Okay.

PATIENT O707
Alright.  You're not certain of it.  And did you guys decide whether I take my lisinopril?

DOCTOR O707
Hold on one second, are you still smoking?

PATIENT O707
Yes.

DOCTOR O707
They do have a bariatric surgery that does bypass and banding around the stomach.

PATIENT O707
Uh yeah actually that's two of them.

DOCTOR O707
Yeah they won't do, we don't have a plastic surgery that does liposuction but bariatric surgery we do have but you can't be smoking.

PATIENT O707
Well then when do I got to stop?

DOCTOR O707
As soon as possible.  Cause they won't even see you.

PATIENT O707
Okay.  Alright @@@.  This one, this is going to make me stop so I got to, okay let me tell you this, I'm not gonna stop today, but this will be my last week, how's that?

DOCTOR O707

DOCTOR O707
Okay.

PATIENT O707
Now okay, that's my promise.

DOCTOR O707
Have you ever had any abdominal surgeries before?

PATIENT O707
No but I've had my stomach, I had open heart surgery.

DOCTOR O707
Okay.  They are just wondering how complicated it's gonna be.  Because the more surgeries you have the more scar tissue you have.

PATIENT O707
No, no, no.  I don't know if I have no scar, but I don't go out naked.

DOCTOR O707
Okay.

PATIENT O707

DOCTOR O707
So when you go talk to them you.

PATIENT O707

DOCTOR O707
