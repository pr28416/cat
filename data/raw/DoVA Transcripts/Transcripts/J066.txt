DOCTOR J066
PATIENT?   

PATIENT J066
How you doing?

DOCTOR J066
Okay and yourself?

PATIENT J066
Good.  @@@.

DOCTOR J066
Follow me.  Yeah. 

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
How have you been?

SECOND PERSON J066
He's been real good.

PATIENT J066
My only problem so far, well other than the blood pressure that I just found out it was high, I fell back in the middle of January.  I tripped and uh injured my wrist and uh but it's not getting any better, my wrist.  When I fell it swelled uh and there was pain in the shoulders and I get a burning sensation in the shoulders, but that's subsided and my left shoulder is a little bit, not the same as it was prior to the fall, it's not gotten any better.

DOCTOR J066
Which hand is it?

PATIENT J066
The right hand.

DOCTOR J066
And the right shoulder?

PATIENT J066
Left shoulder.  Yeah and it continues.  This is minor so the wrist is not @@@.

DOCTOR J066
It's been going on for the past three months you think?

PATIENT J066
Um since the middle of January, so about two months.

DOCTOR J066
And you've been able to use that hand or you still?

PATIENT J066
I use it but I'll give you, I brought this cause I tried to write something the other day and this is what happens with my signature.  It shook so bad that that's how it looks.

DOCTOR J066
Hmm.

PATIENT J066
So when I start, when I held the pen, it started to shake and that is sort of a representation of what I was trying to write.  There's pain in this position like that and it's located here and here and this area here.

DOCTOR J066
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J066
So like I can't push down, like if I was laying down and to do a push -up or something like that it's different.  The only other little bitty minor thing would be holding where the incision is on the foot, where they did a surgery a year ago and @@@ surgery minor and sometimes there's some numbness in the area but I guess that’s to be expected.

DOCTOR J066
You're still able to walk and do everything else?

PATIENT J066
Oh yeah, the foot is actually 100% better than it was prior to the surgery.

DOCTOR J066
And how did you end up falling, do you remember?

PATIENT J066
Oh the first.

DOCTOR J066
For @@@.

PATIENT J066
Oh okay, what was happening is uh a dog, a lady and was walking a dog and the sidewalk, a tree must have lifted up the sidewalk and I wasn't paying attention to the sidewalk as much as the other dog coming, approaching us and there was a change in elevation or whatever between one angle of the sidewalk to the other and I tripped on that.  Since then I've been the townhouse has used asphalt to repair that area so that.

DOCTOR J066
Any lightheadedness or anything?

PATIENT J066
Pardon?

DOCTOR J066
Any lightheadedness?

PATIENT J066
No.

DOCTOR J066
Any chest pain or feeling like your heart's racing?

PATIENT J066
No, you know I feel fine.

DOCTOR J066
Did you lose any consciousness?

PATIENT J066
No I have not, no, just when I go to sleep.

DOCTOR J066
Oh good.  

PATIENT J066
Although my mother used to say I was unconsciousness all the time.

DOCTOR J066
Any falls previously?

PATIENT J066
Uh that's how I broke my foot though back in 2009; I tripped over a drywall lift so.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah.

PATIENT J066
I'm not that prone to falling.

DOCTOR J066
Okay, I see.

PATIENT J066
I was looking at a hammer and there was an apparatus there's three legs that come out and I was looking beyond the legs sticking out and I tripped on it. I actually didn't fall.  I put my foot off to prevent the fall and the stress I guess.

DOCTOR J066
Hmm.

PATIENT J066
Caused the break.  Technically I didn't fall, fall okay.

DOCTOR J066
So as far as the medications, you're still up-to-date, do you need any medications?

PATIENT J066
No I'm okay.  Yet there was one that was discontinued um @@@ I think.

DOCTOR J066
Hmm.

PATIENT J066
@@@ a cholesterol.

DOCTOR J066
And that was discontinued or?

PATIENT J066
No, it just ran out.

DOCTOR J066
How long ago did you last take it?

PATIENT J066
Gee I don't remember I'd say a couple months ago.

DOCTOR J066
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT J066
Uh uh.  Zocor and simi-es, whatever, I can't pronounce either one of those.  Blood pressure was high.  And then the nurse said something, I don't know @@@.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah @@@ a blood pressure cuff.

PATIENT J066
But I haven't taken the blood pressure medication today.

DOCTOR J066
Okay.  And you're still taking the pantoprazole?

PATIENT J066
Yes I do.

DOCTOR J066
Is that for reflux?

PATIENT J066
Yes uh-huh. It doesn’t stop it as much of it seems like antacids.  Um there was a period where in one week that I got three episodes of reflux and uh aspiration in the lung.  That's not caused by uh food intake it's based on really how tired I am for some reason.

DOCTOR J066
Okay.

PATIENT J066
Uh other than that one week for a three episodes, or so, very few, few and far between.

DOCTOR J066
Uh-huh.  And how has your weight been?

PATIENT J066
It's gaining.  I think it was around 200 today.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah.  @@@.

PATIENT J066
It's a problem.

DOCTOR J066
You been trying to gain weight?

PATIENT J066
No I was not.

DOCTOR J066
Okay.  Are you exercising?

PATIENT J066
Each night I walk about three miles with the dog.

DOCTOR J066
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J066
And it's not really exercising.

DOCTOR J066
Still @@@.

PATIENT J066
I'm not sedentary.

DOCTOR J066
Sedentary, yeah. Any burning when you pee?  Or any difficulty urinating?

PATIENT J066
No.  Nothing really other than the wrist right now, nothing.

DOCTOR J066
Any shortness of breath, cough?

PATIENT J066
No, just the only coughing occurred after one of those, that  week, there was some sort of mucus coming up from – that subsided shortly thereafter and that was nothing.

DOCTOR J066
I was looking at the x-rays of the wrist.

PATIENT J066
What would be here?

DOCTOR J066
Various bones and it has like eight bones and so.

PATIENT J066
It's just this part, junction right, it junctions.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah but it still potentially be a bone that's in there.

PATIENT J066
Oh.

DOCTOR J066
So it could be a nerve, so just get an x-ray and we can send you to physical therapy as well @@@ means to kind of strengthen the joint if there's something else that's causing problems.

PATIENT J066
I really hasn’t gotten better. It one of those things especially if you fall in front of a woman or a girl, you're like it could be broken, whatever, you just get up and “I'm fine.”

DOCTOR J066
Yeah.

PATIENT J066
Then you go home and cry but like it did swell.  I don't recall any black and blue, @@@ but the hand just swelled in this area.  This side gives me more pain than this side.  This is the side that swelled.

DOCTOR J066
Do you smoke at all?

PATIENT J066
No I don't smoke and I don't drink.  I assume the MOVE Clinic, it's some sort of exercise program?

DOCTOR J066
It is yeah.  Are you interested in it?

PATIENT J066
Is that somewhere you do cardiovascular?

DOCTOR J066
Not just no.

PATIENT J066
What do they do?

DOCTOR J066
Here they work on diet and various exercise programs that one can do to help people lose weight.

PATIENT J066
Let me see if I could do it by myself.  But it's something if I can't, I would be interested.  I really enjoyed the cardiovascular program that they had here.

DOCTOR J066
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J066
You know the rehab.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah any history of any sexually transmitted diseases that you know of?

PATIENT J066
No.  How much longer will you be working at Loyola?

DOCTOR J066
@@@  it's 15 months yeah.

PATIENT J066
Uh-huh.  So where are you hoping to go afterwards?

DOCTOR J066
Really I've not decided. 

PATIENT J066
Hmm.

DOCTOR J066
I have family in Minneapolis and Pittsburgh.

PATIENT J066
Minneapolis uh it's kind of wintry up there, well not now.  It was a couple of weeks now.

DOCTOR J066
So yeah, I can't really say, we'll see.

PATIENT J066
People go to new clinics, not a bad place.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah.

PATIENT J066
Most of Minneapolis.

DOCTOR J066
Have you ever had an ultrasound of your liver before?

PATIENT J066
No I have not.  @@@ enzymes.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah I think they've been up in the past before.  They’re up at this time.

PATIENT J066
Extremely?

DOCTOR J066
Not extremely, 60s, 100s. Normal is under 40 @@@.  No abdominal pain that you’re having?

PATIENT J066
No nothing.  Is that from the @@@

DOCTOR J066
It could be.  You're not having any kind of muscle aches or anything?

PATIENT J066
No.

DOCTOR J066
You've been taking that medication for a while too?

PATIENT J066
Yes, uh-huh.

DOCTOR J066
Something I can just continue to watch as well.  

PATIENT J066
Hmm.  Now what was it 60?

DOCTOR J066
One was 60 and the other one's 100.

PATIENT J066
And both of them are supposed to be?

DOCTOR J066
The first one's supposed to be under 40 and the second one is under 60.

PATIENT J066
Oh they're elevated.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah.

PATIENT J066
Hmm.  @@@.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah I definitely think we should do an ultrasound and check some other labs.  No weakness or fatigue?

PATIENT J066
No not really.

DOCTOR J066
No change in the skin color, rashes or anything?

PATIENT J066
No.

DOCTOR J066
Joint pain?

PATIENT J066
Joint pain here.

DOCTOR J066
Other than that wrist?

PATIENT J066
No nothing, nothing.

DOCTOR J066
Good okay.  Deep breath through your mouth.  Good, you can breathe normal.  Do you get any swelling in your legs at all?

PATIENT J066
No nothing.  This is where the pain, with the stents, prior to the stents, prior to the surgery, came from.  Not uh.

DOCTOR J066
@@@.

PATIENT J066
No I don't have anything like that.

DOCTOR J066
I've had other patients with that similar.

PATIENT J066
And it was bilateral on both sides.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah.

PATIENT J066
And uh on this side.

DOCTOR J066
@@@.

PATIENT J066
So I'm very aware of pain that might originate or doing it.

DOCTOR J066
Relax your arm.  Not too bad, I got 150/78.  It should be under 140.

PATIENT J066
Hmm.

DOCTOR J066
So not terrible.  Just lay back for me.  And you said you didn't take your medications @@@.

PATIENT J066
Yeah.

DOCTOR J066
And just turn your head to the left.  Okay go ahead and sit back up.  Have a seat in the chair that you were.  Any pain?

PATIENT J066
No pain, not when you touch it.

DOCTOR J066
Are you able to do this?

PATIENT J066
I could do it but this is where it starts the pain.

DOCTOR J066
And what about the other wrist?

PATIENT J066
That's fine.

DOCTOR J066
How far back could you put them?

PATIENT J066
I could all the way back; this is where the pain is originating.

DOCTOR J066
And what about when I do this?  Going up the side and this side @@@.

PATIENT J066
Not so much, much less than it was.  The other thing is when I would shake somebody's hand right after, oh about a month after shaking their hand would be a problem.

DOCTOR J066
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J066
This was the position that causes the pain.

DOCTOR J066
Okay and hold your fingers out like this, go ahead and squeeze @@@.  Now squeeze my fingers as tight as you can.

PATIENT J066
What?

DOCTOR J066
I want you to squeeze me just like that.

PATIENT J066
Oh.

DOCTOR J066
As tight as you can, don’t let me pull back.  @@@.  Your strength is a little decreased.  Is it hard when you try to write or sign your name?

PATIENT J066
Um it changes when I write.

DOCTOR J066
Okay.

PATIENT J066
And that was an example of what happens but not all the time.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah.

PATIENT J066
Only at times.  

DOCTOR J066
I'll talk with some of the other doctors and I'll be back then.

PATIENT J066
Okay.  My liver enzymes.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah.

PATIENT J066
They were elevated before.  I had taken part in a clinical trial many, many years ago with the Zocor and @@@ they put them together and @@@ medical research.

DOCTOR J066
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J066
And um my liver enzymes went pretty high there and they took me off that study.

DOCTOR J066
Okay.  We can see.  It can cause enzymes to go up, as you know.  But looking at your enzymes from before and it's over years @@@ a while and then @@@ a few times in 2005 up to 2011 you were always high and you were taking it then so I don't know.  It's interesting to see now and you've had times before they were a little higher.

PATIENT J066
Okay I didn't even @@@.

DOCTOR J066
We'll @@@.  Something that hasn't helped you, your cholesterol numbers have been good, let's take a look at that, we want you kind of under 100 for sure and maybe under 70.  There are times here you're pretty good like under 70, 70 and this time you're up to 104 so you're above where we want you.  We definitely want you under 100.

PATIENT J066
Yeah.

DOCTOR J066
And so it's a just a matter of statin doing that.  Also weight loss and exercise can play a role in that too.  

PATIENT J066
Depending on my weight.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah you're weight has gone up 10 pounds and so this could be a reflection of the weight more than anything too so.

PATIENT J066
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J066
Something we need to consider to.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
But I'll talk with the other doctor and we'll see the next steps okay.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  86:40  DOCTOR IN:  92:40)

DOCTOR J066
Okay so we're gonna continue the statin.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
And we'll just recheck the labs in the future at the next visit so we might six months, check and we'll give you a blood pressure cuff, we'll do x-rays of the wrist.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
We'll do an ultrasound of the liver to see and make sure it's what we think it is, this just may be because of, they call it fatty liver sometimes fat infiltrates the liver and it can cause these enzymes to go up.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
So we'll just make sure that's the reason behind this.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
And then I'll get you a splint for the wrist.

PATIENT J066
@@@ ace bandages for support.

DOCTOR J066
You don't want a splint then?

PATIENT J066
I don’t think so.  Let's see what the x-ray shows first.

DOCTOR J066
And then I'll have them send this blood pressure cuff to your house.

PATIENT J066
Concerned about a couple things, one my weight, the blood pressure and the liver enzymes.  And this a fatty, what do you call, the liver or is that something that will clear up?

DOCTOR J066
With weight control and @@@ um.  There’s really, just weight and time progressed further and some other risk factors like hepatitis, viral hepatitis or alcoholic hepatitis.

PATIENT J066
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J066
Um it can progress further as well.

PATIENT J066
I'll try to stay on the same dosage of blood pressure medicine.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah your pressure is nearly where we want it to be.  In fact you can just stay on the same medication that should do it.

PATIENT J066
Monitor that.  Uh feeling well is deceiving.  

DOCTOR J066
Numbers don't prove it.  

PATIENT J066
Now the ultrasound they'll schedule that?

DOCTOR J066
Yeah you can maybe even schedule it at the front desk.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
So I put these labs in for three months.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
I think I should see you back then.

PATIENT J066
So in three months I would come and get.

DOCTOR J066
Just the blood work.

PATIENT J066
Just the blood work and then they would be given to you and then if anything out of the ordinary you'll contact me.

DOCTOR J066
Uh-huh.  We can see you back in six months.

PATIENT J066
And you'll reorder the @@@?

DOCTOR J066
Uh-huh.  We'll just do fasting labs in three months’ time.

PATIENT J066
Okay.  They'll send out a letter or just show up.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah they'll send probably a letter I believe.  Okay.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
And you are going to get the x-rays today @@@.

PATIENT J066
And then again if there's something wrong with the x-ray you'll contact me or somebody will?

DOCTOR J066
Definitely.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
Any other questions you have?

PATIENT J066
No, nothing.  My concern were the three things I mentioned the blood pressure, the weight and uh that helps with the wrist support thing.

DOCTOR J066
Did you want to try the MOVE Program?

PATIENT J066
Um let me see how, it should come down with the warmer weather and @@@.

DOCTOR J066
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J066
If it doesn't I will definitely contact you.

DOCTOR J066
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT J066
@@@ I did not realize that I was up that high.

DOCTOR J066
Okay.

PATIENT J066
So I'll go for the x-ray and get that done today.

DOCTOR J066
Yeah.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
And then labs in three months.

PATIENT J066
Right okay.  Do I take that?

DOCTOR J066
Yeah.  You can give it up front.

PATIENT J066
Okay.

DOCTOR J066
You can schedule the ultrasound okay.  

PATIENT J066
Okay.  Thank you very much.

DOCTOR J066
You take care @@@.
