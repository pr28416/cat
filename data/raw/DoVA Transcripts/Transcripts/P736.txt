DOCTOR P736
Yeah, no that's fine.  Alright let me just pull up your chart here.  The doctor that was on this computer before locked it and now I have to restart it, so I've been @@@ you today.  Okay.  While that catches up with us, how long has it been this bad?

PATIENT P736
Well it's been hurting for a while you know.

DOCTOR P736
How long?

PATIENT P736
The doctor that's been coming out to see me, you know, she has been giving me some pain pills, but she don't want to continue to just giving me pain pills.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
She wants me to you know get it checked out.  She wanted me to go to a pain doctor.

DOCTOR P736

Mobile uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
What was she giving you for the pain do you know?

PATIENT P736
Uh.

DOCTOR P736
Was it Vicodin?

PATIENT P736
Vicodin, Vicodin.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.  That's the reason.  Usually we like to give people Vicodin to try and get them over a hump.

PATIENT P736
Yeah.

DOCTOR P736
People who have chronic back pain like that.

PATIENT P736
Yes.

DOCTOR P736
You're always gonna be in some degree of pain but I'm sure as you know if it's bad.

PATIENT P736
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR P736
If it's bad enough you'll get something done.

PATIENT P736
Yes.

DOCTOR P736
So some people have pain all the time?

PATIENT P736
Yes.

DOCTOR P736
Your body gets used to that.

PATIENT P736
Yeah well you know it helped, but you know but you know but she doesn't want to continue to give it to me cause she say that you know it would probably start affecting my liver and then you know it will be habit-forming too also.

DOCTOR P736
Right.

PATIENT P736
You know so she didn't want to continue to give it to me you know.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
So she wanted me to go to a pain doctor.

DOCTOR P736
Okay and really um, I'm not a pain doctor.  I'm a general internist, which means, but I can get you to the pain doctor and I can try my best to get you on, you know, something else.

PATIENT P736
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR P736
It might help cause I don’t have more experience with pain that she does.

PATIENT P736
Right.

DOCTOR P736
Um are you taking any other medications?

PATIENT P736
Uh no.  My high blood pressure, that's the only thing.

DOCTOR P736
Do you know what that's called?

PATIENT P736
Uh, I don't remember the name of it.

DOCTOR P736
Is this the first time you've been here, with us?

PATIENT P736
What?

DOCTOR P736
Is this the first time you've been here to the VA?

PATIENT P736
No, I was here um, I don't know about six weeks ago.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.  I'll check to see if it's @@@ then I can look and we can see all your meds.

PATIENT P736
Right.

DOCTOR P736
And your vitals and how your blood pressure has been and all that kind of stuff.  Um you said it's in the hip as well?

PATIENT P736
Yeah they I mean it radiates.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
It's in my back and then it radiates down to my hip.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
And then it goes all the way down to my knees.

DOCTOR P736
Does it ever reach the back of the foot?

PATIENT P736
Pardon?

DOCTOR P736
Does it ever reach the back of the foot?

PATIENT P736
No uh uh.

DOCTOR P736
Okay, it stops at the knees.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Um any incontinence?  Are you losing your bowel or your bladder with this?

PATIENT P736
Am I?

DOCTOR P736
Losing your bowel or your bladder.  Are you being incontinent with this pain?  I know this sounds like a strange question but the same nerves that supply down the back of the leg also supply your bladder and your bowels.  So if people are having a lot of compression on that nerve for some reason or the other.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Sometimes they're not able to hold their bowels or bladder.  Has that been a problem for you?

PATIENT P736
No, no, no, no.

DOCTOR P736
Good.  Any tingling on the inner thighs at all or just pain down the back?

PATIENT P736
Uh it's just goes; it goes in the thighs and then the back of the knees.  If feels like its radiating.

DOCTOR P736
Oh yeah, I'm sure it does.  I mean it sounds to me just um like textbook sciatica.

PATIENT P736
I thought it was you know like, see at one time I was carrying my wallet in my back, in the back pocket you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
And uh somebody told me that that's probably what's, you know, what's causing the pain you know.

DOCTOR P736
Uh I don't know about that.

PATIENT P736
But I haven't been carrying a wallet back there for a while; I keep my wallet in the coat pocket.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah but you're probably still getting the pain huh?

PATIENT P736
Yeah.

DOCTOR P736
Let me pull this up.  I'm sorry for the delay.  I'm gonna pull up the internet too and I'm gonna show you something um, cause has anybody ever done an MRI of the back or explain to you why you get the pain in the hip as well?  Has anybody ever talked to you about that aside from the wallet theory?

PATIENT P736
No they took x-rays you know.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
But uh.  They asked me if I had fallen or something.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
But I denied it.  

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
You know I don't remember myself falling.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.  When did you first start having back trouble?

PATIENT P736
Uh.

DOCTOR P736
Even as a young man?

PATIENT P736
I'd say about, about two years.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
About two years ago and then I, I had a therapist come over and he used to give me uh exercise you know cause I have in all the years of walking being bent over like this you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
And uh he would give me exercise and then after the exercise it would do okay.

DOCTOR P736
Probably feel good.

PATIENT P736
Yeah it helped.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
You know but then after a while you know I got it going back again.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.  Let me call this nurse back if you could @@@.

PATIENT P736
Alright.

(Doctor makes a phone call)

DOCTOR P736
Man they keep us, so I'm, most the doctors here we all work at either University of Illinois or Northwestern.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
You know.

PATIENT P736
@@@.

DOCTOR P736
And they keep us, so I was at work last night till about 10 p.m. and admitted 28 patients yesterday.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
So it's just gonna be, you know it’s one thing after another.

PATIENT P736
Yesterday they were telling me to go to the uh.

DOCTOR P736
U of I?

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh and uh I just happened to be passing here and I was you know @@@ a bit, I just asked if any of the pain clinics you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
Here you know and they told me yeah so this is where I stopped you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah, nothing wrong with that, especially if you're a veteran, use your benefits.

PATIENT P736
Yeah.

DOCTOR P736
They're all gonna be free.

PATIENT P736
Yeah.

DOCTOR P736
And if you’re not getting your medication here, um you know right now we should definitely start because I'm sure it's gonna be, I mean depending on what your co-pay is and stuff.

PATIENT P736
Yes.

DOCTOR P736
It's usually a lot cheaper than getting it on the outside.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.  Alright.  So what they did it looks like that they gave you some x-rays.  They x-rayed the back, spine and x-rayed the right hip and then the right femur, which is this bone here.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
And you actually had @@@ you saw DOCTOR, the one I was just telling the nurse to go page, who's covering for me over there.  Um.  So did you get x-rays the last time you were here?

PATIENT P736
No I didn't get the x-rays here.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
You know, the day the VA told me to go and get them I was hurting so bad.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
And she told me that I had trouble walking down here to Radiology and then going over there to the uh.

DOCTOR P736
Lab and all this stuff.

PATIENT P736
Lab and stuff you know and man I was hurting so bad that day I just kept on out the door you know.

DOCTOR P736
I understand, I understand.

PATIENT P736
I wanted to keep my appointment today you know I, yeah I wanted to go and got to keep my appointment.  I had lost my appointment slip.

DOCTOR P736
Hmm.

PATIENT P736
I didn't know what time I was supposed to you know be here.  I was here early this morning.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah I saw that, 10:44.

PATIENT P736
Yeah, uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
So let me take a listen and then I want to show you this picture.  Um so what the physical therapist was probably doing that helps is a lot of times strengthening those muscles are on the back groups helps you take some of the pressure off for the spine.  Your spine is like Legos, like blocks.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
And if you get trouble in that with the little nerves coming out.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
You tent to get pain like you're having.

PATIENT P736
Yeah.

DOCTOR P736
Um so the physical therapy is good because it strengthens all the muscles around that and keeps those vertebrae from @@@ and putting pressure on.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Um, let me see if I can take a listen to you.  Do you have heart problems?

PATIENT P736
Do I have what?

DOCTOR P736
Heart troubles?

PATIENT P736
Heart troubles?

DOCTOR P736
Have you ever had a heart attack or?

PATIENT P736
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.  Mouth open, deep breath in and out.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Okay.  Can you show me with one hand where it hurts the most?  Right on the side there huh?

PATIENT P736
Right in here.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.  Did you ever wear a brace when you were a kid?  Did they ever put you in a back brace when you were a child or anything like that?

PATIENT P736
No um.  I know, I @@@ when I was 5-year-olds I got run over by an automobile, you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
And I wore a cast.  I was in a cast from here all the way down to you know.

DOCTOR P736
Oh wow.

PATIENT P736
And both my legs so.

DOCTOR P736
Wow.

PATIENT P736
So.

DOCTOR P736
Cause on the exam your spine is a little crooked.  It almost looks like a little scoliosis but not only are bent like this, you’re bent a little bit this way.

PATIENT P736
Yeah.

DOCTOR P736
And that's typical.  Scoliosis usually we think of the spine going like this but in reality  it can @@@.

PATIENT P736
Yeah okay.  It's a little bit different in there.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah I think having scoliosis and having an injury in the past.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Makes you more likely to have this so, scoot your butt back for me, I just want to test your reflexes here of your foot, alright.  And just relax.  Do me a favor and take your hands and go like this, perfect.  Okay.  So the pain is on the side.  I don't want you to have pain, of course, but I'm glad it's not on the bone.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Okay I'm gonna lay you back.  You can go real slow.  Just lay back.  Does that make the pain any better, any worse?  Can you relax for me @@@.

PATIENT P736
I get stiff but it doesn't make me feel pain or anything.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.  So I'm gonna lift your lift your leg up here.  I want you to tell me if it causes you any pain and if so where, alright.  We'll go real slow.  Tell me if it's hurting you.  Tell me when okay.  You alright?

PATIENT P736
Okay it's starting to hurt now.

DOCTOR P736
Where does it hurt?

PATIENT P736
Right there.

DOCTOR P736
Right there alright.  Okay the same here.  Does it cause any pain when I pick this one up?

PATIENT P736
Yeah this ones bad.

DOCTOR P736
It hurts you on that side huh.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Alright.  Let me sit you up here.  Alright.  Is there anything that seems to make the pain better or worse?

PATIENT P736
Pardon?

DOCTOR P736
Does anything seem to make the pain better or worse position wise?

PATIENT P736
A position?

DOCTOR P736
Yeah, like leaning forward, leaning back, anything like that?

PATIENT P736
Well sitting down you know helps the pain.  When I stand and when I walk, when I walk is when it really, you know it really hurt most.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
And that's when I have the most pain is when I walk.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
You know.  As long as I'm still.

DOCTOR P736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P736
But when I cramp, you know like I be on the bus sometimes and like if the bus is crowded or something.

DOCTOR P736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P736
And I have to scoot a certain way.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
Because then you know.

DOCTOR P736
It takes some of the pressure off huh.

PATIENT P736
Yes, you know.

DOCTOR P736
Alright, excuse me. (Doctor speaks to someone at the door)  Let me show you this picture.  So I think what's going on um, pretty classic for something we call sciatica.  I just put in three x-ray of the back.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
But I think I already know what I'm gonna find.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Probably gonna see.  Can you see right here, I know it's kind of, let's see if I can make this any bigger, okay so that's much better.  So what I, said, oh alright so your pain you were telling me is kind of right here.  We're looking at the back of this gentleman right.

PATIENT P736
Hmm.

DOCTOR P736
The pain is kind of right here. 

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
So but these T's and these L's stand for are how medicine named the blocks that make up your lumbar spine.  What the picture is trying to show are all the nerves that come out in between those blocks.  The pictures of blocks here and a block there.  So from things like injuries like you got hit when you were five.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
One thing, scoliosis is another thing.  Those are two things that tend to give people arthritis in the back okay and what happens when they get the arthritis, so picture these kind of two blocks here, there's a close-up picture and he and you live your life in your 30s you just came out no problem and you have no pain.  So these nerves travel everywhere, some down your legs, up your arms wherever and ever nerve is responsible for a different part of the body okay.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
So the reason why I was asking you does your pain go past your knee, does the pain reach your feet at sometimes is to figure out exactly what nerve might be responsible for causing you this pain.  So as we age you get these little bony spurs here and these little bony spurs pinch those nerves.  So the fact that you're getting pain here and the pain goes all the way down to your knees but doesn't get past the leg.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Tells me your trouble is probably in the nerve L3-L4, actually probably most definitely in L3-L4.  So what I bet we're gonna find in your x-rays, we're gonna find some bony spurs compressing those nerves.  So what do we do to treat it is the big question.  There's a component of inflammation.  So you're always gonna have those spurs, you can't get rid of them, despite surgery, despite anything.  So we got to get in the place where we're treating your pain on a daily basis.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
And whenever you get these inflammations you get exacerbations you know you throw out your back or sit for too long whatever, you're gonna have these ups and downs of pain.  At that point, I'm definitely comfortable to give you Vicodin.  At that point I'm definitely comfortable giving you Flexeril which is actually a muscle relaxant.  That's what DOCTOR gave you before.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Did that help you at all?  The Flexeril?

PATIENT P736
Um I had some before.  They helped you know at night you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT P736
They uh you know when I go to bed you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
They helped but during the day they don't they don't do a thing.

DOCTOR P736
They don't do it okay.  Alright um the other thing of course is I want to see your x-rays even though I'm pretty sure I'm gonna see those bony spurs compressing the nerves.  I want to see if there’s anything else going on.  You've never had cancer?  Right you haven't.

PATIENT P736
No, no.

DOCTOR P736
Alright very good.  Um so maybe let's start there.  @@@.  But I think that’s a good way to do it and I like to show my patients just so they understand what's going on.  You know if I explain to you what's going on then we can work together to get you feeling better you know.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Um let's see here.  Okay just let me enter this.  So I'll just kind of go through what DOCTOR said.  You have a history of hypertension, the scoliosis and the lumbago, that's the back pain.  You've had ulcers in the stomach and then what it says, its kind like you've had um some blockages in the heart.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
But like you told me, no heart attacks or heart troubles.  Surgeries you had the removed parts of the ulcer.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Um you're taking the Vicodin and then the blood pressure medications.  Are you still smoking?

PATIENT P736
Uh I smoke about four or five cigarettes a day.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
Yeah.

DOCTOR P736
I think that's better of course than a pack you know but smoking and pain are related.

PATIENT P736
Yeah I'm, I'm weaning myself off the cigarettes.

DOCTOR P736
Okay have you ever had a colonoscopy?  This has nothing to do with your back.

PATIENT P736
Yeah.

DOCTOR P736
You did.

PATIENT P736
Yeah.

DOCTOR P736
Okay was it normal?

PATIENT P736
Uh yes.

DOCTOR P736
And when did you have that?

PATIENT P736
Just before I had the ulcer.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
Because you know I thought because of when I had that colonoscopy they took a piece.

DOCTOR P736
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P736
Of my skin, they pulled a piece of my skin.

DOCTOR P736
A biopsy yeah.

PATIENT P736
Yeah.  And I was assuming that that was what caused the ulcer.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
After they you know stuck that you know probe up in there.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
And started taking stuff you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
Cause I thought maybe that caused me to have ulcers because I never did have any pain.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
In my stomach before you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yes.

PATIENT P736
It was never any pain.  I never had no kind of uh indication that I had a ulcer you know.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
And then you know and I went to the hospital they told me that I had a hole in my stomach you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
They were telling me there was a ulcer you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
That's what I found out.

DOCTOR P736
That there was a hole.  Any stomach pain since?

PATIENT P736
No.

DOCTOR P736
No.

PATIENT P736
No I never had any.

DOCTOR P736
So no blood in the stool or dark tarry stools?

PATIENT P736
Uh uh.

DOCTOR P736
Okay good.  So when did you have the operation to take the?

PATIENT P736
Uh.

DOCTOR P736
10 years ago, 5 years ago?

PATIENT P736
No, about five years ago.

DOCTOR P736
About five years.  Are you allergic to anything?

PATIENT P736
No, no.

DOCTOR P736
So in terms of today what exactly do you think I could do for you today.  Are you bad enough where you think you need Vicodin?

PATIENT P736
Pardon?

DOCTOR P736
Are you bad enough where you think you need some Vicodin?

PATIENT P736
I don't, usually can I get the Norco, they said Norco is good.

DOCTOR P736
Norco is just like two Vicodins.

PATIENT P736
Yeah but they said it don't, it don't do what Vicodin do.

DOCTOR P736
Now do you have liver troubles?

PATIENT P736
Huh?

DOCTOR P736
Do you have hepatitis or liver cancer?

PATIENT P736
Uh uh.

DOCTOR P736
No hepatitis?  

PATIENT P736
No.

DOCTOR P736
So you haven't really @@@.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
You can take as much as 4 grams of Tylenol a day.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
That’s quite a bit of Tylenol right.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
And a Vicodin was 325 mg.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
So in theory you could take probably about 12 Vicodin before you start having liver trouble.

PATIENT P736
Oh okay.

DOCTOR P736
A lot of nurses don't understand that, they think all Vicodin and Tylenol is bad for your liver. It’s not.

PATIENT P736
Oh.

DOCTOR P736
Um in terms of the Norco they @@@ don't let us have Norco here cause it's a stronger narcotic.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
So I prefer to keep you on Vicodin.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
But, again, if you’re getting them from me I'm gonna talk to my attending DOCTOR and see what she thinks about a pain consult.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
Um at this point.  But the fact that you've only had this for two years I like the fact that you did some physical therapy.

PATIENT P736
Hmm.

DOCTOR P736
I like the fact that you're still moving around.

PATIENT P736
Hmm.

DOCTOR P736
I don't think there's anything wrong with your hip.  I don't think there's anything wrong with the back of your leg.  I think it's all coming from the back.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
But I want to get those x-rays with DOCTOR and just do some regular labs to make sure there's nothing else awry.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
Um any questions for me or anything I didn't ask you that you think might be important?

PATIENT P736
The only thing, the nurse when she come out to the house she felt a knot, do you think it's a muscle or something that's here?

DOCTOR P736
Yeah I think you were probably having a muscle spasm secondary to this arthritis.

PATIENT P736
Cause right up there, right in where you had.

DOCTOR P736
Where I'm pressing?

PATIENT P736
No up a little bit, up a little bit.

DOCTOR P736
Right here?

PATIENT P736
Right in there, right in there.  She said it was swollen or something.  She felt a bulge or something.

DOCTOR P736
I think it's, yeah there is a little bulge but I don't know if it's due to the misalignment of the spine.

PATIENT P736
Could it be a muscle or something?

DOCTOR P736
I don't know.  It's hard to say, does it hurt when I press on it?

PATIENT P736
No it doesn't hurt.

DOCTOR P736
I think it's more just because your spine is misaligned but let's get that x-ray and see if we see anything.

PATIENT P736
Hmm.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
Um alright, anything else?  Any other questions or anything else bothering you?

PATIENT P736
No.

DOCTOR P736
Okay let me just take a listen.

PATIENT P736
I can't hear.

DOCTOR P736
Okay.  Have you ever worn hearing aids?

DOCTOR P736
Okay.  So this is the kind of thing that's completely up to you because there's really no harm in not treating it and I'm not trying to push a bunch of junk down your throat since this is the first time I meet you.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
But they do make medicine for that.

PATIENT P736
Yeah but a guy told me he said you ought to be glad that you go to the bathroom.

DOCTOR P736

PATIENT P736
Because he stopped going and he was on dialysis.

DOCTOR P736

PATIENT P736
And so.

DOCTOR P736
That's trouble with the kidneys.  You keep your blood pressure low you'll never have trouble with the kidneys.

PATIENT P736
Uh.

DOCTOR P736
You've got significant arthritis in these hands.

PATIENT P736
Arthritis, that's what this is.

DOCTOR P736
Oh yeah significant.  So sometimes, so the fact that you have trouble here, usually it means it's just kind of wear and tear arthritis, over use arthritis.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Sometimes more women than men we see a lot of swollen knee joints, it's just sometimes @@@ upright @@@.

PATIENT P736
Yeah but I know I got arthritis.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah but this is, I can tell you've had it for years because this is permanent enlargement, this isn't active arthritis per say.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
But the swelling and there's been a lot of damage for years.  Okay.  Do you take anything besides the Vicodin at home?  Do you ever try Tylenol or tramadol or anything else?

PATIENT P736
Tramadol they gave me, they gave me tramadol but tramadol really don't @@@.

DOCTOR P736

DOCTOR P736

PATIENT P736
Nowhere else.  I don't even have it in my hand.  I have it in my shoulder sometimes you know.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.

PATIENT P736
Other than that I don't you know.  My biggest problem is the back area and my hips.

DOCTOR P736
Yeah.  Alright.  

PATIENT P736
I'm gonna be just fine.

DOCTOR P736
Well I'll give you some um, I think it's important to take scheduled Tylenol, I really do.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
So taking it kind of every eight hours.  Cause pain is the kind of thing if you don't stay ahead of it it will catch up to you.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
You know so especially with a lot of these veterans who are trying to be tough you know, they say oh I can take the pain when I can take the pain meds and they wait until it gets so bad and then they really have to play catch up.

PATIENT P736
Yeah.

DOCTOR P736
So there's nothing wrong with you taking Tylenol like three times a day.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
Staying ahead of it and that's gonna be your baseline cause you're always gonna have this pain.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
I'm comfortable giving you some Vicodin to take home.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
Take it when you need it

PATIENT P736
Alright.

DOCTOR P736
I'm comfortable with giving you some muscle relaxants to take home, take it before you go to bed if the pain is really bothering you.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
But at least start taking something or something like acetaminophen or Tylenol regularly.

PATIENT P736
@@@.

DOCTOR P736
Because you've bled in your stomach.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
I would avoid things like ibuprofen.  I would avoid Naprosyn.  Things in that family we call NSAIDs.

PATIENT P736
Right uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
That's what NAME had is ulcers @@@ basketball players popping pain relievers.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
And they'll give you ulcers.

PATIENT P736
Right.

DOCTOR P736
And even if your ulcers weren't from that we just avoid them.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
You know, we don't want any trouble.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Um I want to see an x-ray um just to make sure there's nothing going on.  Again I don't really feel a mass.  I know what's she's talking about but again I think it's just because you're a little bit crooked back there.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
So let's do an x-ray and make sure there's nothing um nothing concerning.

PATIENT P736
Okay.

DOCTOR P736
And just some basic blood work if that's alright, just a blood count and a chemistry.  Make sure your kidneys are working, make sure you're not anemic anything like that.

PATIENT P736
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P736
Have you been losing weight?

PATIENT P736
Uh I haven't been losing weight and I haven't been gaining weight.

DOCTOR P736
