DOCTOR Z196

Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
How are things going?

PATIENT Z196
Uh fine.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.

PATIENT Z196
Uh no complaints.

DOCTOR Z196
Good.

PATIENT Z196
I'm feeling very well.

DOCTOR Z196
Good.

PATIENT Z196
Uh I need uh.

DOCTOR Z196
Some refills.

PATIENT Z196
Some refills yeah.

DOCTOR Z196
Yep.

PATIENT Z196
And I brought a list of my medications.

DOCTOR Z196
Sure, let's take a look.

PATIENT Z196
And I have one question.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
On one of them.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
I'm uh you know daily on the lovastatin.

DOCTOR Z196
Right.

PATIENT Z196
Triamterene.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
And the potassium supplements.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.  Yep.

PATIENT Z196
However, when my prescription comes they have a warning.

DOCTOR Z196
Yep.

PATIENT Z196
For people who take triamterene.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
Uh saying that it can raise your body's potassium level.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
And do not use potassium supplements if you're taking triamterene.

DOCTOR Z196
Right and that is something that it causes normally but your potassium, even with the supplement is low.

PATIENT Z196
Okay.

DOCTOR Z196
So we're watching that.

PATIENT Z196
Okay.

DOCTOR Z196
We have our eye out for it.

PATIENT Z196
Okay.

DOCTOR Z196
But we, if your potassium drops too low it's bad for your heart.

PATIENT Z196
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z196
So we have to keep an eye on it.

PATIENT Z196
Uh I.

DOCTOR Z196
So we do check it with every lab we do with you but so far this is working so we're gonna stay on it.

PATIENT Z196
And I eat a banana every day.

DOCTOR Z196
Good.

PATIENT Z196
@@@.

DOCTOR Z196
That's fine.  Just don't eat like 12 yeah.  Cause that would be bad.  Yeah a banana every day is perfect.

PATIENT Z196
Uh.

DOCTOR Z196
And then what else is going on?

PATIENT Z196
Okay.

DOCTOR Z196
The aspirin you're taking low dose.  Do you get it through us?

PATIENT Z196
Uh no.

DOCTOR Z196
Do you want to?  I don't know what the cost difference would be but we could try if you want.  I can write this for you and I can write the multivitamin for you.

PATIENT Z196
Uh.

DOCTOR Z196
Or do you prefer to get them yourself?

PATIENT Z196
I can get them myself.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay, that's fine.

PATIENT Z196
Uh I will need the lovastatin renewed.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
Because I have about ten tablets let.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.  Do you want to pick it up downstairs or do you want us to mail to you.

PATIENT Z196
Um you can send it in the mail.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay let's do that now so we don't forget.  Now what's the dose you're taking now?

PATIENT Z196
Uh the lovastatin.

DOCTOR Z196
Do you take 40?

PATIENT Z196
40 mg.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.  You want 90-day supply?

PATIENT Z196
A 90-day supply yeah.

DOCTOR Z196
Wonderful.  

PATIENT Z196
Uh but my cholesterol is in good shape?

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah I was just looking at that before you walked in.  So your cholesterol, your total cholesterol is 195 uh your good cholesterol is 50 so that's really good and we want it above 40.  So diet, exercise, that kind of stuff.

PATIENT Z196
Right.

DOCTOR Z196
And then your LDL is 103 and you're not a diabetic and so a man your age with high blood pressure should be below 100 cause you're right at that cusp.

PATIENT Z196
Right.

DOCTOR Z196
At 100.  So I mean we're kind of sitting where we need to at this point.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
So it's good okay.  Um and then I was looking at your other labs so your potassium, like I told you, it's even on like the low end of normal even with the supplement.

PATIENT Z196
Right.

DOCTOR Z196
So we're okay with staying with what we're doing.  The kidney function is good.  Your fasting glucose was really good.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
That means you're not like pre-diabetic or anything like that.

PATIENT Z196
Right every time it's been tested it's at 90 so.

DOCTOR Z196
Yes.

PATIENT Z196
So what did it do this time?

DOCTOR Z196
It was 95.

PATIENT Z196
95.

DOCTOR Z196
Yes, yes and then um and then I checked your liver enzymes cause people that are on statin for a long time you just want to monitor.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
To see how the liver is doing and those are totally normal.  Um and then.

PATIENT Z196
And then uh last year I took the uh oral anti-fungal for 90 days.

DOCTOR Z196
Oh yeah, yeah.

PATIENT Z196
So there was concern that that would uh.

DOCTOR Z196
Damage your liver.

PATIENT Z196
…danage the liver yeah.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah no so those are perfect.  Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
Uh that resulted in all the toenails look perfect.

DOCTOR Z196
Oh good.  Good and we're done with that right?

PATIENT Z196
Right, right.

DOCTOR Z196
You're done with the whole, okay good.  Good and then we also checked your, what we call a CBC which is like the white blood cell count, the hemoglobin and your platelets and those are all normal.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
So we don't have to worry about anemia or anything like that.

PATIENT Z196
Right but before I had high levels of triglycerides, is that?

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah so your triglycerides are pretty high but we want you around 150 and you're at 200.  Um have you ever taken like niacin?

PATIENT Z196
Uh well I take a multivitamin.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.

PATIENT Z196
And that has niacin in it.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah but niacin itself is probably a little bit stronger.  We can try niacin and see how you respond to it and recheck them in like three months um.

PATIENT Z196
What causes the triglycerides to be so high?

DOCTOR Z196
A lot of it is genetics and then some of its diet so you know a high fat diet can cause you to have a lot of triglycerides.

PATIENT Z196
I'm on a low fat diet.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah, yeah.  Sometimes it's genetic so kind of take care of it.

PATIENT Z196
Uh but alcohol would elevate it?

DOCTOR Z196
Alcohol can absolutely.  Let me see where they were before.  Yeah I mean you were at 219 before, you're 209 now.  You've always been around 200.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
So I'm guessing it's more of a, yeah it's more of a genetic component.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
Cause your diet seems like it's pretty good, from the last time we talked.  So good.  So yeah I mean you can try niacin.  I can give it to you through the VA.  Is this a B vitamin?

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
And the side effects of that is some people get flushing.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
Like they just feel very hot and red.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
And then the answer to that would be a slow-release niacin.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
You know a slower acting for your systems, kind of a tablet that's slower.  Do you want to try it?

PATIENT Z196
I'll try that uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.  Let's go ahead and do that and then we'll recheck everything in a couple of months.  90-day supply, see how you tolerate it.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
I'd say about maybe 15% of people have that reaction so, hopefully you won't.  Okay um and what about your other medicines, the cholesterol pill?

PATIENT Z196
Uh my potassium supplement I got a 60-day supply left.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
And no refills.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
So maybe I need it.

DOCTOR Z196
We'll do that and then I'll give you enough refills.  How's your blood pressure been doing in the last year?

PATIENT Z196
Uh it's been fine.  I have uh a device I use on my wrist to measure it.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
But uh it gives me fairly high readings and the device is inaccurate.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.

PATIENT Z196
Uh when they tested the blood pressure I was about 112/72.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah this number is really good.

PATIENT Z196
Which is.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.

PATIENT Z196
I'm getting 145/90.

DOCTOR Z196
Oh really.

PATIENT Z196
When I test at home.

DOCTOR Z196
Do you want a different um monitor?  I can order you one from the VA.

PATIENT Z196
How much is that gonna cost?

DOCTOR Z196
I don't think it costs very much at all and you just pick it up downstairs in the Prosthetics Department.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
On your way out.  Do you want that?

PATIENT Z196
I bought this thing and I paid 90 some dollars for it.

DOCTOR Z196
It's definitely less than that.  I feel the wrist ones can be pretty inaccurate.

PATIENT Z196
I think so.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah so I mean you can go pick up one at Walgreens.  I prefer you get the cuff or I can order one through the VA which is probably cheaper for you.  I'm not exactly sure how much they charge but.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
When you go pick it up you can ask them and if you don't want it.

PATIENT Z196
Right.

DOCTOR Z196
Then don't take it.

PATIENT Z196
Right, right.

DOCTOR Z196
Do you want to do that at least?

PATIENT Z196
I'll try that.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
Alright because I repeat the tests on the wrist and a couple of minutes later the figure is all different.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.  Doesn’t seem reliable.

PATIENT Z196
It's a general estimation though.

DOCTOR Z196
Yes.  The potassium needed some refills too.  This was followed up in November.  You were just taking potassium and chloride okay.  So we also this time around checked your prostate.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
To see what your prostate hormone was doing and it's a little bit elevated.  Has anyone ever told you that before?

PATIENT Z196
Uh no.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.  Cause I know you, let's see you started following here at the VA a couple of years ago or was it how long ago?

PATIENT Z196
Uh it's almost two years.

DOCTOR Z196
Two years okay.  No one's ever checked here at the VA so I don't know what your records were on the outside.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
Um but it's a little bit elevated so it's a little concerning.  It could be many different things and most likely it's probably the gland itself just gets bigger as you age.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
Um and that's what most people you know end up having a high PSA.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
It can also be, if it's really, really high, it can also be prostate cancer um but yours isn't to that level at this point.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
But I still want to keep an eye on it and probably send you to see the urology doctors.

PATIENT Z196
Okay.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay, just for them to kind of keep an eye on things.

PATIENT Z196
Okay.

DOCTOR Z196
To watch it a little bit closer.  Are you having any urinary symptoms at home like when you wake up at night and have to go to the bathroom?

PATIENT Z196
Uh I've had uh you know frequent and urgent urination for a long time.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
Uh I think probably it's due to the blood pressure medication.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay yeah since it's a diuretic.

PATIENT Z196
It's a diuretic.

DOCTOR Z196
Right, right.

PATIENT Z196
Uh I take the blood pressure medications in the morning.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
Not at night, if I take it at night I have to get up.

DOCTOR Z196
Get up.

PATIENT Z196
In the night.

DOCTOR Z196
If you take it in the morning how often do you get up at night to go to the bathroom?

PATIENT Z196
Uh I don't have to get up at night.

DOCTOR Z196
You don't have to get up.  Do you ever have to um kind of go to the bathroom multiple times in a row to empty your bladder fully?

PATIENT Z196
Not really no.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.  Do you ever feel like it takes a while for you to start a urine stream or it just won't come out?

PATIENT Z196
No, no.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay, okay, so yeah we'll just you know, we'll have you go to the urology doctors and have them kind of take a look at it okay.

PATIENT Z196
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z196
It's a good thing to catch early.

PATIENT Z196
Yeah.

DOCTOR Z196
For sure, in case anything is going on.

PATIENT Z196
And I also see a dermatologist.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.

PATIENT Z196
She's very good.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
Uh she has tried to do something for my lip.  Uh the first that she wanted me to try.

DOCTOR Z196
Like a prescription.

PATIENT Z196
Is a 2.5% cream.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh.

PATIENT Z196
It really has no effect.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
My lip won't heal.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.  What happened there?

PATIENT Z196
Uh I had surgery to remove a very large growth.

DOCTOR Z196
Oh okay.

PATIENT Z196
Under my left.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.

PATIENT Z196
The one on my back of my neck was basal cell carcinoma.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.

PATIENT Z196
This one was like a large tumor due to sun damage.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
But it was not basal cell.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
Uh it's never healed properly and my lip was numb and for eight years the skin peeled off my lips.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
Every other day.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
Uh she wanted me to try this one.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
And I haven't been back to talk to her since she wanted me to try but this doesn't do anything.

DOCTOR Z196
Isn't helping either.

PATIENT Z196
No.

DOCTOR Z196
When did you last see her?

PATIENT Z196
Uh I saw her um maybe three or four months ago.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay and that's when she gave you the last cream?

PATIENT Z196
She gave me the last one yeah.

DOCTOR Z196
And that's not working.

PATIENT Z196
She said to see if it would work.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.

PATIENT Z196
Uh I still have plenty of it left.  I stopped taking it.

DOCTOR Z196
But it's not working.  How long did you try it before you kind of?

PATIENT Z196
Uh I used it for uh almost two months.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.  Yeah, that's a good try.  So you're supposed to go back and seen them in June, June 11th it looks like.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay, no it's July, July 11th.

PATIENT Z196
Right.

DOCTOR Z196
Do you want to see if we can get you in earlier?

PATIENT Z196
Uh.

DOCTOR Z196
Is it really bothering you or are you just kind of.

PATIENT Z196
It doesn't really bother me.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
But uh, it's slightly sore.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
And the skin peels off of it every other day.  It's been doing that for eight years.

DOCTOR Z196
You can't seem to get it under control huh.  Yeah.  So you're like what's going on yeah.  I'll let them deal with that department since I usually don't do that.

PATIENT Z196
Well during the surgery they pulled the skin from the inside of my mouth.

DOCTOR Z196
Out.

PATIENT Z196
To form a lip.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.

PATIENT Z196
And that skin, it cannot be exposed.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.  Maybe that's why yeah.

PATIENT Z196
It has something to do with it.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah, definitely.  It's not made to be outside the mouth so.

PATIENT Z196
Right.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.  Well it looks great; it looks really good though you know as you said it was a pretty big mass.

PATIENT Z196
Uh it was very large under my lip.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah, alright.

PATIENT Z196
And they did two surgeries.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah.

PATIENT Z196
And at the first surgery.

DOCTOR Z196
Where was that done?

PATIENT Z196
Uh it was done by a plastic surgeon.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
Uh.

DOCTOR Z196
Was it at Hines?

PATIENT Z196
No Rush, Oak Park.

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.  Uh and then your ears, how's that going?  You're following with Audiology.

PATIENT Z196
Uh yes the hearing aids are working very well.

DOCTOR Z196
Perfect, perfect.

PATIENT Z196
I have a device for the telephone also so I'm now able to hear on the phone calls.

DOCTOR Z196
Oh good, that's good.  Alright.  Okay I was just putting in your Urology referral.

PATIENT Z196
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Z196
For you to go see them.  Okay.  Anything else going on?

PATIENT Z196
Uh not that I can think of.

DOCTOR Z196
How's your weight been doing?  Are you up, down?

PATIENT Z196

DOCTOR Z196
Okay.

PATIENT Z196
Uh after I left the hospital I lost 10 pounds.

DOCTOR Z196
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Z196
But now I've gained it all back again.

DOCTOR Z196
You gained it all back huh.  Yeah it looks like you were.

PATIENT Z196
I went down to 180.

DOCTOR Z196
Yeah, about this time last year you were about the same.

PATIENT Z196
Hmm.

DOCTOR Z196
If you're interested I mean its more trips to the VA if you can and if not I mean.

PATIENT Z196
No because I can really do everything on my own.

DOCTOR Z196
