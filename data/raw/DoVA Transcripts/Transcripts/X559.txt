DOCTOR X559
If you need it I'm happy to refill it for you.

PATIENT X559

So I think it's something like, from the muscle, it's got a muscle relaxer to it.

DOCTOR X559
Muscle relaxer that I see on here.

PATIENT X559
That's probably uh what's the name of it?

DOCTOR X559

DOCTOR X559
But that's not for anxiety.

PATIENT X559
Yeah I know that.

DOCTOR X559
Okay.  I don't want you to take that for anxiety.

PATIENT X559
Oh no.

DOCTOR X559
Okay.  That's only because you're having spasms I think in your neck right?

PATIENT X559
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X559
Do you find yourself needing to take it for anxiety? If you feel like you need something for anxiety we could give you something better that's more appropriate.

DOCTOR X559
Is it easier when you're on the phone?

PATIENT X559
Uh.

DOCTOR X559
Or is it about the same for you?

PATIENT X559
Yeah it's about the same.  I don't talk; I don't like to talk too long on the phone no ways.

DOCTOR X559
Have you ever tried anything in the past?

PATIENT X559
In the?

DOCTOR X559
In terms of medication for anxiety.

PATIENT X559
I don't know whatever they been giving me, I been taking. Because that's I was always like keeping it cause since that time I think that was having to drink and everybody around me was drinking cause I was more relaxed when I drank and you know more often I would @@@.
 
DOCTOR X559
So you were drinking a lot back then?

PATIENT X559
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR X559
So it looks like you had four DUIs.

PATIENT X559
No it was just two.

DOCTOR X559
That is what the note says though.

PATIENT X559
Had four DUIs, not really.

DOCTOR X559
@@@.

PATIENT X559
@@@.

DOCTOR X559
Even one is too many.

PATIENT X559
Yeah I guess.

DOCTOR X559
Because you're putting yourself in danger and you're putting somebody else in danger.

PATIENT X559
Right.

DOCTOR X559
Right.

PATIENT X559
Right.

DOCTOR X559
You know PATIENT I really want you to go over to PAC.  I know you don't want to.  Cause here's the thing right, I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna be straightforward.  I mean I'm not hiding anything from you.

PATIENT X559
Yeah.

DOCTOR X559
I'm reading this note here when you went to go see the psychologist in October of this past year and you told him there's a lot going on so it's like you know at that time you were still using some cocaine.  Still drinking but not as much and you know you have some issues with your wife and you're worried about your job and I think the medication you were using at the time you feel like was working for you.

PATIENT X559
Yes.

DOCTOR X559
And I think that they would be the best people to help you with you with this cause my concern is go on the medications that we start for anxiety um uh they're not good for people who have had a history of drinking too much alcohol.

PATIENT X559
Right.

DOCTOR X559
It gets real complicated.

PATIENT X559
Yeah.
