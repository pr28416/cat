DOCTOR O313
Alright let me make a note of this here, eye doctor, foot doctor, Substance Abuse Clinic, ibuprofen and acid reflux.  Alright.  I'll quickly put in the request for the eye doctor then and just go down everything one by one.  Tell me why you need to see the eye doctor.

PATIENT O313

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
That's, for some reason that's come down from higher up that's all we can give.

PATIENT O313
That'd be fine.

DOCTOR O313
So we'll do that.  We'll also check some blood work cause sometimes if there's something you know wrong in the blood that might be a reason why too and we've got to figure that out.

PATIENT O313
You can put up all those appointments.

DOCTOR O313
Dentists, we'll try to get this stuff set up first and then once this is getting better we'll talk about your teeth.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
What I want you to do you know for the, they have some paperwork that they'll have you do at Admitting to see if you qualify for the dental services here.  I guess it has to do with how much service connected you are and how much they'll cover and stuff like that.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
If you're covered by dental here we can have them see you but if you're not then they won't even, they'll only take emergencies.

PATIENT O313
Oh.

DOCTOR O313

PATIENT O313
Okay.  What about this acid reflux?

DOCTOR O313
I can get you something for that too, hold on a second.  Acid reflux uh, do you usually take medications?  Is it after every meal or is it worse when you lie down in bed?

PATIENT O313
It's worse when I lay down in bed.  I have to jump out of bed and run to the bathroom.

DOCTOR O313

PATIENT O313
It just make me feel like I'm @@@ my stomach.

DOCTOR O313
Okay.  I'm gonna give you something, it says to take it at bedtime but I would probably take it like half an hour or an hour before you actually lie down to go to bed.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
If it bothers you during the day as well you can take this medication up to twice a day so you could take it at morning and night.

PATIENT O313
And see this stuff here; it's been keeping it under control until at night.

DOCTOR O313
Gotcha.  You can keep taking these if you want.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
Okay.  Like a multivitamin sort of thing you've got going on here.

PATIENT O313
Okay, so it won't hurt.

DOCTOR O313
For the eyes we will send you to uh, I'll ask them to schedule a follow-up for you in the Eye Clinic.  You saw them, if you see them within like a two year period they don't count you as a new patient, you're a follow-up one so if they can't schedule you you'll have to call and just say I want to make a follow-up appointment.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
You'll be a new patient in the Nail Care Clinic; this is the Podiatry Clinic who takes care of the calluses.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
Uh the Liver Clinic you're also gonna be a new patient in.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
And the Addictions Clinic.  They should be able to direct you to the Addiction Central Intake.  They have their own office where they make their appointments.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
So the front desk will tell you how to get there.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
Uh Admitting will have some paperwork to see if you qualify for the dental stuff.

PATIENT O313
When I leave here.

DOCTOR O313

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
So the places that I want you to stop off at are the front desk, the Pharmacy and the Laboratory we're gonna get some blood work cause it's been about a year and a half now.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
Okay.  I want to see you back in a month just to see how all of these things have kind of played out.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
Maybe after the holidays, like the early January, you could come in; we could check your blood pressure again with just the nurse.

PATIENT O313
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR O313
And then if your blood pressure is still high we can change the medication a little bit.

PATIENT O313
Okay.

DOCTOR O313
