PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
Okay were you ever on a medicine called clopidogrel or Plavix for that?  No.

PATIENT W102
I don't think so.

DOCTOR W102
That's alright.

PATIENT W102
I may have.

DOCTOR W102
You may not have been back then but that's okay, that's fine.  Um let's see.

DOCTOR W102

PATIENT W102
Here.

DOCTOR W102
Um okay.  So we have our records as actually taking simvastatin.  Does that, does that?

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
Okay so the records show you get all your medicines here.

PATIENT W102
Yeah my medicines come from here.

DOCTOR W102
That would be accurate okay good.

PATIENT W102
I've got like stockpiles of them in the last couple days.  Not that, in the past couple weeks uh.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah you've just been getting more of them.

PATIENT W102
Yeah and so.

DOCTOR W102
@@@ needing it.

PATIENT W102
All of a sudden I got all these uh.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah.

PATIENT W102
Pharmaceuticals coming in you know.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah @@@.  Okay.

PATIENT W102
Uh it's straightened out, I mean I know it's hard but.

DOCTOR W102
How have you been feeling lately?

PATIENT W102
Right now my allergies are beating me up.

DOCTOR W102
Do you get allergies every year around this time?

PATIENT W102
No.

DOCTOR W102
So this is kind of new.

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
What type of problems are you having?

PATIENT W102
Oh just uh sneezing and sore throat and headache.  You know my sinuses are of course all clogged up.

DOCTOR W102
Okay and are you taking any over-the-counter medicines for that?

PATIENT W102
Yeah I've been taking Zyrtec is that right?

DOCTOR W102
Yeah.  Is that working for you?

PATIENT W102
Eh.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
No.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
You know.  But that's not the only problem I; at the house we redid the kitchen.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah.

PATIENT W102
So there's no dry wall.

DOCTOR W102
Right, right, right.

PATIENT W102
Demo, yeah.

DOCTOR W102
You tore it up a lot.

PATIENT W102
Right, on top of the allergies it's you know so.

DOCTOR W102
Alright um, sounds good.  We can see if we can do anything for that.  We have a medicine I think would be a little stronger that Zyrtec you could maybe try.

PATIENT W102
Yeah I talked to the pharmacist there at Walgreen’s.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah.

PATIENT W102
And I told him what I was taking.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah.

PATIENT W102
And he said here, try the Zyrtec.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah.  We can just keep going on that then; hopefully it will get better once the dust settles.

PATIENT W102
But like I said if I could get something stronger I'd sure @@@.

DOCTOR W102
It's the same medicine.  You don't know dose your taking do you?

PATIENT W102
Uh I'm taking one every 24 hours so.

DOCTOR W102
So probably @@@ would change is what we can offer for now so keep you going with what your doing.

PATIENT W102
Yeah that's fine.  If you're not going to change it.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah.

PATIENT W102
There’s no sense in it.

DOCTOR W102
Okay um just because this is required that you see me; I got a couple questions for you.

PATIENT W102
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W102
Um previous surgeries you had your foot surgery in 2008 anything else?

PATIENT W102
Heart.

DOCTOR W102
Oh then you had a heart surgery stent okay.  Okay.

PATIENT W102
And I had a cancer taken off my back.

DOCTOR W102
Okay what; I don't have any record but what was done there?

PATIENT W102
No it was done here.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
Uh it's kind of @@@ cancer you know like.

DOCTOR W102
It was like a @@@.

PATIENT W102
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR W102
A mole or something?

PATIENT W102
It was more like a pimple.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
That just wouldn't heal.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
And uh, yeah but it was like a kids cancer.

DOCTOR W102
And when was that removed?

PATIENT W102
Uh a couple years ago, last year I think, maybe the year before.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT W102
But that was nothing, it was all outpatient.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.  2007.

PATIENT W102
Right.

DOCTOR W102
Right yeah.

PATIENT W102
And uh yeah I was in and out of Hematology for quite a while too.  Uh my red blood platelets were like off the charts.

DOCTOR W102
Platelets were off yeah.

PATIENT W102
Okay you got that.

DOCTOR W102
Right, got that.  And now they're doing okay as far as you know?

PATIENT W102
As far as I know yeah.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.  Do you remember when the last time you had it checked was?

PATIENT W102
Uh my understanding it's every time they draw blood uh they get it.

DOCTOR W102
So it was back in December they took a look at it.

PATIENT W102
Okay.

DOCTOR W102
It looked good okay, good.  Alright that's it.  Um I'm looking through your chart.  It looks like family history wise your mother had a stroke?  

PATIENT W102
My mother had a heart attack.

DOCTOR W102
She had a heart attack.

PATIENT W102
Numerous.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah.

PATIENT W102
Three or four.

DOCTOR W102
Did she not have a stroke then?

PATIENT W102
No my mom never had a stroke.

DOCTOR W102
Okay, alright.

PATIENT W102
And my dad either died of a heart attack or a stroke, they don't know what.

DOCTOR W102
And then your brother has hypertension and high blood pressure?

PATIENT W102
Uh one of my brothers.

DOCTOR W102
One of your brothers does.

PATIENT W102
Well it's not hypertension, its more cholesterol related.

DOCTOR W102
Anything else run in the family, cancers or anything like that?

PATIENT W102
No uh it's all like heart.  They all drop dead.

DOCTOR W102
Do you know how old your parents were when they had heart attacks?

PATIENT W102
Oh my mother was young uh, probably in her late 40s her first one and she's had like three or four.  I think she's had three bypasses, separate you know.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.  Then your dad.

PATIENT W102
He never saw a doctor in his life but he died at 52 of either a heart attack or a stroke; they don't know what killed him.  But he got that taking his pants off.  

DOCTOR W102
Um I have also in the records that you are currently smoking.  Are you still smoking?  Okay.

PATIENT W102
Yeah and it's less.

DOCTOR W102
About one pack a day?

PATIENT W102
You know I kind of laid off.

DOCTOR W102
Great.

PATIENT W102
Okay uh.

DOCTOR W102
But previously you were a lot more, about two packs a day?

PATIENT W102
Yeah I was way up there.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
I was a smoking fool.

DOCTOR W102
And then you've had problems with alcohol in the past too?

PATIENT W102
Yes.

DOCTOR W102
And have you quit?

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
When did you quit?

PATIENT W102
Oh, in the last ten years I've been sober a lot more than I've been drunk really but uh.  I haven't had a drink since January now.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.  Alright great.  Um let's see and what branch of the military were you?

PATIENT W102
I was in the Navy.  I was a heavy equipment operator in the Seabees.  

DOCTOR W102
Alright.  Um are you living with anybody right now?

PATIENT W102
I live with my sister.

DOCTOR W102
You do okay.  Anything else bothering you besides the allergies we need to talk about?

PATIENT W102
My ankle right now, it's not the ankle itself, so much - everyday aches and pains.  But the skin.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah.

PATIENT W102
Okay and that’s where, sometimes okay but now @@@ that’s where there we're doing all that digging.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.  What's the specific symptom that you have a complaint about today?  Is it like itchiness, dryness?

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
Of the skin or is it something else?

PATIENT W102
No it does hurt from time to time.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
I mean it'll get so dry it'll bleed.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
Uh I don't know like once a month.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.  You know it looks; it does look definitely really dried out down there.

PATIENT W102
Yes.

DOCTOR W102
And kind of where it is, it's in a bad spot and you tend to rub it up against @@@.

PATIENT W102
Right.

DOCTOR W102
I'd try just having some lotion on it.

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
But um, that @@@ stuff or something.  Probably a jar like a emollient or whatever you can get at Walgreen’s or something.  It's kind of like a moisturizer but it's not, it doesn't come in a bottle, a can of it almost.

PATIENT W102
Okay.

DOCTOR W102
Like an oil product.

PATIENT W102
Okay.

DOCTOR W102
Try that. Apply that twice a day.

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
Uh it should help.  @@@ will help you out a lot.

PATIENT W102
Okay.

DOCTOR W102
A lot of times for a scars too, it seems to be like having a lot of problems, it helps healing, helps it really to stay like stay healthy so.

PATIENT W102
Yeah that's kind of been a small concern.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
You know.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.  Your blood pressure is a little bit low today.

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
Is that normal for you?

PATIENT W102
Yep.

DOCTOR W102
Okay, sounds good.  And otherwise um.  Like I told you before your platelets all looked fine.  The rest of your electrolytes back in December when we looked at them all looked fine.

PATIENT W102
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W102
Um I don't know if there's a whole lot more to talk about outside of having getting down to uh making sure that you're as healthy as you can be and it looks like you're doing pretty good right now.

PATIENT W102
Yeah I think I you now.  Beside the allergies I feel fine.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
You know.

DOCTOR W102
Alright.  Let's see you had a colonoscopy back in 2007.

PATIENT W102
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W102
Make this look a little prettier um and they didn't find anything?

PATIENT W102
As far as I know.  I never heard anything.

DOCTOR W102
No polyps or anything.  @@@.  It showed they found some hemorrhoids but.

PATIENT W102
Oh.

DOCTOR W102
But that's nothing to be concerned about obviously okay.

PATIENT W102
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W102
Alright.

PATIENT W102
That turned out to be expensive if that's all that fine; in some ways I could have told them there were hemorrhoids.

DOCTOR W102
Have you ever had your prostate levels checked?

PATIENT W102
Uh no.

DOCTOR W102
Um it is a test that we can do for you.

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
So you have had the test before whether you know it or not.

PATIENT W102
Okay.

DOCTOR W102
It’s bascially, it's a blood test that uh that we can look to see if there is any elevation in it we can be a little more aggressive to see if there's any prostate cancer.

PATIENT W102
Right.

DOCTOR W102
Your tests have been normal in the past; we don't need to repeat anything.

PATIENT W102
Okay.

DOCTOR W102
If you want to, it's just something that's followed yearly.

PATIENT W102
Uh you're in charge here alright so.

DOCTOR W102
I will tell you there are pros and cons to checking the prostate levels, sometimes it can elevate for no reason whatsoever.

PATIENT W102
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W102
It’ll lead to down the road getting a biopsy.

PATIENT W102
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W102
That has its own complications.

PATIENT W102
Right.

DOCTOR W102
Um but then you don't get the, if we're not checking it you don't get the benefits of early detection so.

PATIENT W102
Hmm.

DOCTOR W102
Uh but no prostate cancer in your family history, I could go either way.  I would say if.

PATIENT W102
You're calling the shots.

DOCTOR W102
If you're the kind of guy that would be really concerned about that, otherwise if uh we want to check it then we can go ahead and check it.

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
If you really don't care too much or.

PATIENT W102
Right now I'm not worried about it.

DOCTOR W102
Okay, so we'll hold off on checking it.

PATIENT W102
Alright.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.  Okay and then cholesterol.  Have you had that checked?

PATIENT W102
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
And it goes up and down I mean.

DOCTOR W102
It looks like you're doing pretty good actually so.

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
Uh your.

PATIENT W102
Is that something to check?

DOCTOR W102
Your last cholesterol test was back in February.  I think you're probably due for another check.

PATIENT W102
Okay.

DOCTOR W102
As well as the thiamine and the blood sugars, making sure those all look good as well.

PATIENT W102
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W102
You've never had a problem with those before.

PATIENT W102
No.

DOCTOR W102
I don’t expect there to be a problem.  Do you remember when your last tetanus shot was?

PATIENT W102
Um it was a few years back but it was here, it should be on record.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah 2007, good.  Alright.  @@@

PATIENT W102
Whatever you got to do buddy.

DOCTOR W102
Alright um, also you're taking the fluoxetine for depression is that right?

PATIENT W102
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W102
How's that going?  Are you having any symptoms?

PATIENT W102
No I'm doing alright.

DOCTOR W102
@@@.

PATIENT W102
Yeah I'm doing okay with it you know.  Knock on wood.

DOCTOR W102
Sounds good.

PATIENT W102
You know.

DOCTOR W102
Um some of the things they ask us to ask you about are about risk factors for sexually transmitted infections um, you're not having any unprotected sex or anything?

PATIENT W102
I'm not having any sex period so.

DOCTOR W102
Oh you're not, alright.  Um and then do you have any tattoos?

PATIENT W102
Yeah I have a tattoo.

DOCTOR W102
Have you ever been checked for hepatitis C before?

PATIENT W102
I don't know, I don't think so.  Uh but actually that's something we probably should look at.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
Cause the last uh partner I had uh she died of Hep C.

DOCTOR W102
Yeah that's been tested; it looks like back in 2007.

PATIENT W102
Okay.

DOCTOR W102
Uh and it was normal.

PATIENT W102
And she died, when did she die, shortly after my stroke.

DOCTOR W102
Let me see, have you ever had the HIV test done?

PATIENT W102
Yeah, yeah, more than one occasion yeah.

DOCTOR W102
Great well, it appears to me that you're a pretty healthy fellow right now um.  I'd say keep taking that Zyrtec for the allergies and do the moisturizer on your ankle.

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
We'll make sure everything else is doing well.  We'll check some blood tests.  I'm assuming you've eaten today?

PATIENT W102
Yes.

DOCTOR W102
So uh when you get a chance to get some fasting blood draw for us, just stop down at the first floor Laboratory.

PATIENT W102
Okay.

DOCTOR W102
Um we'll check your cholesterol, we'll check your electrolytes and check your platelets again to make sure everything looks okay uh and then following that, you've got my clearance for doing whatever you have been doing.

PATIENT W102
Well I want this @@@.

DOCTOR W102
Hop up here.

PATIENT W102
Alright.

DOCTOR W102
@@@.

PATIENT W102
Yeah.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102
And what I need, is a little help with a @@@ back there.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.  Take a look up here.

PATIENT W102
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W102
Couple deep breaths.  Good, again, good.  Again, good, one more, alright.  Breathe normal.  Deep breathe in and hold it.

PATIENT W102
Okay.

DOCTOR W102
Lift that chest, again deep breath in and hold it.  Great.  It sounds very good.  Now you've never had any chest pain or any trouble breathing?

PATIENT W102
I didn't have any uh chest pains even with my heart attack.

DOCTOR W102
What kind of symptoms were you having then?

PATIENT W102
That was right through here.

DOCTOR W102
You had an arm pain?

PATIENT W102
Oh yeah.  I mean it's like, kind of like you cut it off okay.  You know.  Okay here's what it is.  This is, okay this was what I received from the VA.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102

DOCTOR W102

PATIENT W102
Which is 100%.

DOCTOR W102
Okay.

PATIENT W102

PATIENT W102
Oh I can fill that out.

DOCTOR W102

PATIENT W102
Alright thank you doctor.
