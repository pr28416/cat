PATIENT M412
Right they admitted me.  I was only there for a day.  This was on a Sunday, they released me that Monday around 6 o'clock that evening.  And again that was even after I had taken my blood pressure medicine.

DOCTOR M412
@@@.

PATIENT M412
@@@.

DOCTOR M412
Same it's like 160 but your diastolic is high, it's over 100.  How about some deep breaths for me.  Big deep breaths.  Well you know I mean you're not really overweight.  I mean everyone can afford to lose a little bit of weight. And you’re so young.  Can you lie back for me?  Any belly pain? 

PATIENT M412
No.

DOCTOR M412
Lift up your leg for me.

PATIENT M412
Like that?

DOCTOR M412
Yep.  Okay now this way good okay.  You can go ahead and sit up.  Okay I'll be right back.  Do you mind if I just go talk with my attending?  

DOCTOR OUT:  47:40  DOCTOR IN:  66:02

DOCTOR M412
There’s a few things we should do to make sure there's nothing else going on with your blood pressure okay.  I want to check a bunch of tests.  Do you think um sometimes when you're, when the arteries going to the kidney are small that can cause that.  Sometimes different levels of hormones can cause it um.  So the most accurate way to do some of this stuff is to get actually a 24 hour urine collection.  Do you think you could do that?

PATIENT M412
Yeah.

DOCTOR M412
Okay.  The other thing I want to get is um well I'm gonna increase what you're on right now, the amlodipine I'm gonna increase to 10.  And then we need to get some labs today are you okay with that?

PATIENT M412
Yeah.

DOCTOR M412
Okay. And then I'm gonna get um a, we'll get some urine tests today and then we'll @@@.  And the other thing the only way I really see if your renal arteries are smaller is to get a CAT scan.

PATIENT M412
Uh-huh.  

DOCTOR M412
So I'm gonna order that.  Okay and then just make sure all these labs are put in.  And just we have to ask you, you don't use any drugs, no cocaine or anything like that?

PATIENT M412
No.

DOCTOR M412
You can get these labs today and then I think you should follow up with the pharmacist.  I'm gonna put in another order but you can, sometimes if you can't see me you know.

PATIENT M412
Yeah.

DOCTOR M412
Um if you can't see me you can see her and she can manage this stuff really well and I think it's important cause your blood pressure is so high and you're so young that can really have consequences.  Um so I think you should definitely follow up with her.  She should call you uh but I think the last time I don't think you showed up for the appointment.  So do follow up with her and then the other thing is um, you saw the eye doctor um, alright.  So for now what we'll do is I'm increasing your amlodipine to 10 mg and I'm gonna have that mailed to you.  I'm increasing your metoprolol to take a full tablet instead of a half tablet.

PATIENT M412
Okay.

DOCTOR M412
So 200 mg daily, this is gonna be 10 mg daily and then I would have those labs done today and then I also ordered a CAT scan.

PATIENT M412
Okay.

DOCTOR M412
Okay.  So come back and see me in three months um.  I would see the pharmacist in between.

PATIENT M412
The CAT scan, they  make an appointment out here?

DOCTOR M412
Yeah.

PATIENT M412
Okay.

DOCTOR M412
CT scan and then labs today okay.

PATIENT M412
The CT today also or?

DOCTOR M412
No, no, no you can come back to get that.  Just make sure you get the labs today so I can look at them.

PATIENT M412
Okay.

DOCTOR M412
Okay.

PATIENT M412
Now this, the metoprolol so starting tomorrow morning just take 200?

DOCTOR M412
Yeah.

PATIENT M412
Just take a whole tablet.

DOCTOR M412
Yeah.

PATIENT M412
Okay can you uh have that sent?

DOCTOR M412
Everything's already being sent.

PATIENT M412
Okay.

DOCTOR M412
Yep.  And then the 24 hour urine, they'll tell you how to do that.  You'll have to send it back.

PATIENT M412
Okay.  So when I do that.

DOCTOR M412
Yeah they’ll tell you when to do it, they'll explain that.

PATIENT M412
Okay.

DOCTOR M412
Okay.

PATIENT M412
