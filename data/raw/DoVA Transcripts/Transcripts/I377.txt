PATIENT I377
I went through the MRI, I went @@@.

DOCTOR I377
Yeah I know I believe you.  They're showing an MRI of your cervical spine in November but I'm not seeing an MRI of your knee but I know you've had it done.

PATIENT I377
No, it's not for the knee.  They @@@ that.

DOCTOR I377
That might be making your spasms.

PATIENT I377

DOCTOR I377
DOCTOR.

PATIENT I377

PATIENT I377

You were using a cane the last time I saw you.  So are you using your cane?

PATIENT I377
No, not really, usually I don't use it.

DOCTOR I377
Okay and you haven't seen anyone since you saw me last in September right?

PATIENT I377
No except for DOCTOR, for the MRI.

DOCTOR I377
For the MRI you're right.  Alright so you missed your appointment in October and never came back huh.  So you missed your MRI back in October and then they rescheduled it.  That's yeah, that's what happened.

PATIENT I377
Right okay.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.  Alright now we got that taken care of.  So you've been having spasms with your knee and it's not getting any better.

PATIENT I377

DOCTOR I377
Has it gotten any worse?

PATIENT I377
No, no.

DOCTOR I377
Okay are you having any numbness or tingling?

PATIENT I377
No.

DOCTOR I377
No.

PATIENT I377
The only thing happened; the only thing that really happened is that I have to position myself a certain way in bed, especially when I relax okay.

DOCTOR I377
Right.

PATIENT I377
And then if I don't what happens is that it seems like, it seem like there's a press.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.

PATIENT I377
That comes not just in one space.

DOCTOR I377
Right.

PATIENT I377
And then when I lay it goes up.

DOCTOR I377
Alright, right cause that's what we were talking about last time.

PATIENT I377
Right.

DOCTOR I377
But you aren't having any falls or anything right?

PATIENT I377
No uh uh no.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.

PATIENT I377
And it happens in both legs.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.  The last time I saw you did it just happened in the one?  Or does it move at all cause last time it was just your right knee.

PATIENT I377
No it's both the knees.

DOCTOR I377
It's in both yeah.

PATIENT I377
It's just that the right knee was worse.

DOCTOR I377
Okay than the left.

PATIENT I377
Yeah.

DOCTOR I377
Okay and your blood pressure's in really good control so that's good and you had your colonoscopy and we’re just going through everything to make sure we’re covered and you're still following with the urologist.

PATIENT I377
Yes.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.  Uh have you had your flu shot this year?

PATIENT I377
Yes.

DOCTOR I377
Did you get your H1N1 shot too?

PATIENT I377
I'm not going to take that.

DOCTOR I377
Not gonna take that huh.

PATIENT I377
No.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.  I've heard some mixed reviews about it.  A lot of my patients want to take it and some people absolutely not.

PATIENT I377
I'm not gonna get it.

DOCTOR I377
Okay and then you need another colonoscopy but you wanted to wait until next year.

PATIENT I377
Yes.

DOCTOR I377
Okay so we can schedule you for that next year, cause it's almost @@@@.

PATIENT I377
Right.

DOCTOR I377
Um let's see if your lipids.

PATIENT I377
I want you to look at something here.

DOCTOR I377
Sure.

PATIENT I377
My neck, lift that up.  My wife keeps telling me that behind my neck here.

DOCTOR I377
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I377
Right here, there's a knot, I feel that there's a knot right there.

DOCTOR I377
Well there's one right here.

PATIENT I377
Now I'm not talking about the uh mole.

DOCTOR I377
The thing on your, right cause that's been there for a while.

PATIENT I377
Yeah.

DOCTOR I377
Alright take your jacket off cause you’re taller than I am and I can’t see that high.  Sit over here.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

DOCTOR I377
You haven't been having any chest pain, trouble breathing, nausea, vomiting, blood in your stool?  

PATIENT I377
No.

DOCTOR I377
I'm gonna look at you.  Where’s she seeing one?

PATIENT I377
@@@ I think I'm @@@ right.

DOCTOR I377
Let me see.  Oh it's right there.

PATIENT I377
I guess that's where it's at.  I can't see behind me.

DOCTOR I377
No that's actually your skull.  Cause you've got such thin, cause you're bald up here essentially.

PATIENT I377
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I377
You don't have enough hair so it's the same on both sides.

PATIENT I377
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I377
You've got it symmetrical when we start getting concerned is when you like let's say you had a bump over here but you didn't over here.

PATIENT I377
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I377
Then I may be concerned but they're both exactly the same size.  They're the same as far as depth.  They're not tender right?

PATIENT I377
No.

DOCTOR I377
And you know they're not nodules they're just like the outline of your skull.

PATIENT I377
Oh okay.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.  She you can tell her that  you asked a doctor and it's not anything to be concerned about okay.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

DOCTOR I377
Let me examine you real quick while you’re up here.

PATIENT I377
I can do that.

DOCTOR I377
Okay look straight ahead for me.  Open your mouth, stick out your tongue and say ah.

PATIENT I377
Ah.

DOCTOR I377
No pain there, right?

PATIENT I377
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I377
Take a big deep breath in and out through your mouth.  One more, last one.  Did we ever have you go see Orthopedic Surgery or anything for your knee for the spasms that you’re having, or physical therapy or anything like that?  No.  Cause that might be the next best step that because you're having trouble.  You haven't lost your balance or fallen or anything so right?  You just kind of like when you're laying in bed you've got to lay in a certain position and it feels like it jerks back.

PATIENT I377
It does jerk back.

DOCTOR I377
Yeah.

PATIENT I377
It spasms.

DOCTOR I377
It spasms.

PATIENT I377
It's like the same thing that I had here in my neck.

DOCTOR I377
With your neck.

PATIENT I377
And when I had that my whole shoulder @@@.

DOCTOR I377
Yeah.

PATIENT I377
And that's the way it is right here um.

DOCTOR I377
Does it hurt when I'm pushing right here?

PATIENT I377
No, no, no.

DOCTOR I377
It doesn't hurt at all.

PATIENT I377
No.

DOCTOR I377
It spasms.

PATIENT I377
That's all.

DOCTOR I377
Any leg swelling?

PATIENT I377
No.

DOCTOR I377
Does it happen like at a certain of day or it kind of can happen at any time?

PATIENT I377
If one goes up, nothing I'm doing.

DOCTOR I377
It doesn't wake you up at night does it?

PATIENT I377
Yeah.

DOCTOR I377
It does.

PATIENT I377
Yes.

DOCTOR I377
Sometimes you wake up having leg spasms.

PATIENT I377
Oh man, it just, I've had it come up my legs going back to my back.

DOCTOR I377
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I377
And my wife sometime has to get up.

DOCTOR I377
@@@ and help you out?

PATIENT I377
And pull my legs.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.

PATIENT I377
Pull my legs apart you know.

DOCTOR I377
Yeah.

PATIENT I377
And the only thing that helps me.

DOCTOR I377
Uh-huh.

PATIENT I377
@@@.

DOCTOR I377
That helps with the spasms?

PATIENT I377
Yeah it releases, releases it.

DOCTOR I377
Okay, okay.  So lay down for me.  Cause it doesn't sound like you're really having pain, it sounds more like you're just having spasms.

PATIENT I377
That's what it is.

DOCTOR I377
Alright.  I'm gonna lift your leg up, you tell me if it hurts anywhere.

PATIENT I377
No.

DOCTOR I377
No.

PATIENT I377
Uh uh.

DOCTOR I377
No.  Now can you bend your knee for me?

PATIENT I377
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I377
Put your foot down.  I'm just gonna push a little bit.  You tell me if you feel any pain.

PATIENT I377
Just pressure.

DOCTOR I377
Just pressure.  Go ahead and sit back up.  You need some help?

PATIENT I377
Why?

DOCTOR I377
I need some help, there we go.  Let me see what else we mentioned.  And you said you haven't ever had trauma to that knee or anything like that?

PATIENT I377
Uh uh.

DOCTOR I377
Alright, well let me go talk to DOCTOR, see what she thinks um and we'll go from there.

PATIENT I377
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

DOCTOR I377
Um and the last time I saw you, you had a UTI, a urinary tract infection.

PATIENT I377
Right.

DOCTOR I377
Do you uh.

PATIENT I377
That's cleared.

DOCTOR I377
That's cleared up.  You haven't had another one since then right?

PATIENT I377
Right.

DOCTOR I377
And you're still, so last time we talked about your prostate cancer screening and you said you don't want to get screened anymore because?

PATIENT I377
No.

DOCTOR I377
If you found it you didn't want to do anything about it right?

PATIENT I377
No I didn't say that.

DOCTOR I377
You didn't say that okay.  That was one of the notes from before I saw you so um; do you want to get screened?

PATIENT I377
I don't need to get screened for the prostate.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.  Um I just wanted to make sure.  Cause some of my patients also say well I'm not gonna do anything about it so I don't want to be screened and I say okay, it's up to you.  Um I had one other question oh, your blood pressure.  You don't have a blood pressure cuff at home do you or do you have one?

PATIENT I377
I have, you know what I dropped it.

DOCTOR I377
You dropped it.  Do you need a new one?

PATIENT I377
Will it cost me?

DOCTOR I377
I do not know.  That I do not know.  I can put in the order and you can find out cause they can give it to you at Prosthetics and you can ask them if it's gonna cost anything.

PATIENT I377
Cause I dropped it and uh.

DOCTOR I377
Well the other thing you can do if you dropped it you can bring it back in, they might be able to exchange it for another one.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

DOCTOR I377
If you still have it unless you threw it away.

PATIENT I377
I haven't been using it too much now.

DOCTOR I377
Yeah.

PATIENT I377
@@@.

DOCTOR I377
Well your blood pressure's good today so that's good.  The other thing is there's free blood pressure cuffs and things like Walgreens and Meyers and things like that so you could potentially go there and get it done but if you have one at home I'd like you to you know, especially if you get lightheaded, dizzy or anything like that I want you to check your blood pressure and make sure it's not too low okay.  And you're still taking your amlodipine?

PATIENT I377
Yes uh-huh.

DOCTOR I377
And that's the only medication we have you on.  And the aspirin?

PATIENT I377
Uh I don't take the aspirins every day.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.  Okay.  Yeah actually it was in the Urology Note, the urologist you saw said that you mentioned to them that you, if they, if it was elevated, you probably wouldn't want further intervention.

PATIENT I377
@@@ list.

DOCTOR I377
Perfect.  I will move that off my note.

PATIENT I377
Yeah.

DOCTOR I377
Um when was the last time you saw Urology?  Do remember?

PATIENT I377
In the computer.

DOCTOR I377
(Laughter) Uh it looks like it was September of this year.

PATIENT I377
September yeah.

DOCTOR I377
Yeah right before you saw me.

PATIENT I377
Right.  I wanted to say that but I wasn't sure.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.  Alright.  Give me a minute and I'll go talk to DOCTOR and you need refills today?

PATIENT I377
I only take that one blood pressure medication from you and that's not.

DOCTOR I377
And the aspirin.

PATIENT I377
To and that I go through CVS.

DOCTOR I377
Do you get the aspirin?

PATIENT I377
No just uh, I got it all.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.

PATIENT I377
And it only costs me $7 a prescription.

DOCTOR I377
Really.

PATIENT I377
And it costs the same thing here.

DOCTOR I377
Alright.

PATIENT I377
There's uh, I would like to have though a prescription for ibuprofen but what they gave me for @@@.

DOCTOR I377
Motrin?

PATIENT I377
I think it was the biggest milligrams.

DOCTOR I377
The biggest milligrams of ibuprofen?

PATIENT I377
Yeah.

DOCTOR I377
Well the maximum dose of ibuprofen.

PATIENT I377
Yeah what is the maximum dose?

DOCTOR I377
We wouldn't recommend.  I don't recommend.

PATIENT I377
What do you recommend?  What do you all have?

DOCTOR I377
So well, though you're, what do you want to do.  You want the ibuprofen for your knee but you said your knee is not getting any pain it's just the.

PATIENT I377
What’s your max and minimum?
DOCTOR I377
The max and the minimum?

PATIENT I377
Yes.

DOCTOR I377
Well it depends on your kidney function.  I'm going to have to look into your labs and things.  It could relieve and you want it for your knee?

PATIENT I377
Yes.

DOCTOR I377
Are you having pain anywhere else?

PATIENT I377
Sometimes in the back.

DOCTOR I377
Sometimes in your back.

PATIENT I377
Right now I got pain in my back when I lay down there at night.

DOCTOR I377
Okay cause ibuprofen you can buy over-the-counter.

PATIENT I377
Yes but I want to get the full milligrams @@@.

DOCTOR I377
Right, right.

PATIENT I377
I'm doing that.

DOCTOR I377
So because I just have a hard time with you taking too much of it either.

PATIENT I377
I don't take too much of it either.

DOCTOR I377
Okay, okay.  I can give you a prescription for ibuprofen.

PATIENT I377
But what milligram?

DOCTOR I377
Well I'll give you; I'll give you a prescription for a lower dose and then you can increase it and I'll put on there what the maximum dose is.

PATIENT I377
What's the maximum dose you're gonna give me?

DOCTOR I377
Let me look and see what the maximum dose of ibuprofen would be through the VA okay.  8, eight pills or 800?

PATIENT I377
800.

DOCTOR I377
800, I don't know.

PATIENT I377
I take them.

DOCTOR I377
You take them.  Is that how much you've been taking, that's 800 a day?

PATIENT I377
No.

DOCTOR I377
800 sometimes or?

PATIENT I377
@@@

DOCTOR I377
Oh.

PATIENT I377
I take @@@.

DOCTOR I377
One once a week for your back and for your knee?  Well I guess I could do that for you.

PATIENT I377
@@@.

DOCTOR I377
Okay.  Give me a minute I'll visit with DOCTOR.

(DOCTOR OUT:  84:41  DOCTOR IN 89:00)

SECOND DOCTOR I377
Hey PATIENT.

PATIENT I377
How you doing DOCTOR?

SECOND DOCTOR I377
How are you?

PATIENT I377
Doing good thank you.

SECOND DOCTOR I377
Alright so um uh how's your breathing?

PATIENT I377
Better.

SECOND DOCTOR I377
You don't use any inhalers anymore?  You don't smoke anymore either?

PATIENT I377
I ain't smoked in 25 years.

SECOND DOCTOR I377
Alright.  So.

PATIENT I377
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR I377
In terms of the okay so I don't know what happened to the order we made for the knee.  You got the MRI of your neck but not the knee so we'll make that order again, have you make an appointment and see the orthopedic doctors.

PATIENT I377
Hmm.

SECOND DOCTOR I377
Alright.

PATIENT I377
When that’s going to be?

SECOND DOCTOR I377
Well you can go up today and make an appointment for the MRI.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

DOCTOR I377
But you should see the orthopedic doctors after the MRI is done.

PATIENT I377
Uh-huh, alright.

SECOND DOCTOR I377
And then we'll just.

PATIENT I377
What do I do right now?

FIRST DOCTOR I377
That's what we'll tell you.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Alright sir.  So here's what we're gonna do right now.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
I want you to do three things for me.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
I want you to go up front when you leave here, schedule an appointment with Orthopedics.  I want you to schedule it, well actually you know what, before you do that, I take it back I'll refill your meds.  So what I want you to do, the first thing I want you to go across the hall to the MRI um place where they schedule the MRIs, schedule your MRI because the order, that's why I was getting confused cause the MRI I put in is not in there anymore because it got cancelled and never got rescheduled.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
So I want you to get an MRI of your knees so you need @@@ for both knees okay.  After you get that date of that MRI I want you to come back up here to the front and ask them up front to schedule you for an appointment with the orthopedic surgeons for an appointment after your MRI.  Does that make sense?

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
And then also I want you to follow up with the urologist because you haven't been there in a while and from their last note it seems like there's some confusion about what they wanted and what you want to do so I want you to go talk to them about what exactly the plan should be that fits best with what you want and with what they want okay.  And yeah I'll write it all down for you so you know what to do in what order.  Um also you have, you wanted the ibuprofen.  There's another medication I want you to try as well called salsalate.  

PATIENT I377
I'm not a medication man.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
I know you're not, I know you're not.  I want you to try this instead of the ibuprofen.  I'll give you a prescriptions for both but I want you to try the salsalate first cause I think it might work a little bit better.

PATIENT I377
@@@?

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Salsalate okay and if that doesn't work then you try the ibuprofen.  I'll give you prescriptions for both okay.

PATIENT I377
Same price?

FIRST DOCTOR I377
It's VA meds I have no idea.  Ask the Pharmacy when you get over there.  If it's a problem you come back here and ask me okay.  Um let me write down the order of things that you need to do.  @@@.

PATIENT I377
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Okay.  Go do the MRI, schedule these appointments and then I will see you.  When do you want to see me again?

PATIENT I377
Hmm, well let's find out what dates.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
I want to see you after all these are done.

PATIENT I377
That's what I say just wait until we see the dates.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
So I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna give you 30 tablets of ibuprofen.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Without many refills but I don't want you taking too many of them.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
And then the salsalate I gave you.

PATIENT I377
Now what is this?

FIRST DOCTOR I377
It's a pain medication as well and make sure you take it with food or with milk or something cause it can cause @@@.

PATIENT I377
But I can't take it too.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Don't take both of them at the same time.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Okay um but see if that, see if that helps as well okay.

PATIENT I377
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Just for pain.  I mean if you're having pain occasionally, like I said I don't like giving you that many medications, either.  I don't want you to be taking pain meds cause they all have side effects.  They can cause ulcers and things like that and I don't want that so.  What I'd like for you to do is only take them if you absolutely need them and these aren't working you come back and hopefully we'll get some more information with the MRI and then we'll go from there.  Okay.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
And then I will, I won't reschedule you for the next few months cause I think you @@@.

PATIENT I377
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
This is December so like March?

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Then we can see you in March @@@.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
And if something really abnormal comes up with this MRI, if something really abnormal comes with the MRI I'll give you a call so I want to give you the phone number, let me put this in first.  Alright give me one second I just want to schedule this before you go because it's not in the computer.

PATIENT I377
I'm not in a hurry, just take your time.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Alright.  And we'll put in the consult cause you've never seen the orthopedic surgeons before have you?

PATIENT I377
No.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Okay I'll put in that consult and they'll schedule it for you.  Okay so the consult is in for your appointment with the orthopedic surgeon. You’ve already seen neurology so they should be able to schedule that for you and MRI appointment, the order is in so they should be able to schedule that as well.

PATIENT I377
So get the MRI.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Uh-huh.  Schedule it, here's what you're gonna do.  Schedule MRI and then schedule your appointment okay.  I want to get your phone number real quick.

PATIENT I377
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
Just in case I need to call you, okay is it PHONE NUMBER?

PATIENT I377
That's it.

FIRST DOCTOR I377
