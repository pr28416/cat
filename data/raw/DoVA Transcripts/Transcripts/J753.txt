No I usually don't do, I usually don't check it myself.  I was in for the blood test last week.  I don't know if the results came back.

DOCTOR J753
They did.  Yeah I'll go through that with you.  You've been feeling well though as far as not having any trouble with nausea, vomiting?

PATIENT J753
Uh, I did about a month ago.  I had it for like, I think I must have picked up some kind of a, ate something bad or something cause it was like a 24 hour thing.  But normally I've been doing pretty good and feeling pretty good.  Appetite's good.

Good.  I mean I'd like you to lose 10 pounds but as long as you're not going up.

PATIENT J753
Yeah I should probably lose 20 at least.

DOCTOR J753
Alright, what medicines are you taking, anything?

PATIENT J753
Uh yeah I brought some of the stuff uh; well we're taking the metformin.

DOCTOR J753
Yeah.

PATIENT J753
They tell me to take two, usually I just take one.  Usually I've been averaging probably one a day.

DOCTOR J753
So this one you take it twice a day so once in the morning and once at night.

PATIENT J753
Yeah.

DOCTOR J753
Alright.  Omeprazole, simvastatin.

PATIENT J753
Yeah a doctor gave me something.  He said my cholesterol was a little high so he gave me something for the, for the cholesterol I guess.

DOCTOR J753
Okay.  Do you still take an aspirin every day?

PATIENT J753
Uh probably every other day.

DOCTOR J753
Yeah.

PATIENT J753
You know the low dose one I just take it like uh.

DOCTOR J753
Any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?

PATIENT J753
No, no they're pretty good.

DOCTOR J753
Okay.

PATIENT J753
I always make toast in the morning and it always comes, you know it always comes out hot, I feel it when I pull it out.

DOCTOR J753
@@@.  Well, here's your blood tests, we can go through it.

PATIENT J753
Okay.

DOCTOR J753
Prostate test was normal.

PATIENT J753
Really.

DOCTOR J753
Yep.  We'll do a.

PATIENT J753
Terrific.

DOCTOR J753
Which helps to identify problems with the prostate.

PATIENT J753
Wow.

DOCTOR J753
Um kidney function is normal.  Your glucose was right at the borderline for what we could consider diabetes and we already know that was the case for your, so fine.  Liver function is good.  This was back in a little bit, even further back like in October where we had some urine tested for, showed some reflection of diabetes and then the cholesterol which was a little bit high back then.  So the things that we want to do now.  Now do you get your blood checked with that outside doctor?

PATIENT J753
Uh, when I go to the office I think the last time I was probably there about a month and a half ago or so.

DOCTOR J753
Okay.

PATIENT J753
They did a blood test and it was like, I think he said it was like 130 or something like that.  Like my blood count.

DOCTOR J753
Yeah.  Well, I want to avoid having too many cooks in the kitchen.

PATIENT J753
Yeah.

DOCTOR J753
But there's information that we need to share that that doctor and myself or.

PATIENT J753
Yeah.

DOCTOR J753
Or we'll have to have you repeat some of the blood tests here.

PATIENT J753
Okay.

DOCTOR J753
So if you have any blood work there, bring it into me.

PATIENT J753
Okay.

DOCTOR J753
Uh if you're willing though I'll get some blood tests here.

PATIENT J753
Sure.

DOCTOR J753
Okay.

PATIENT J753
Well how did the blood test last week show up for the fasting?

DOCTOR J753
Yeah that was good.

PATIENT J753
It did.

DOCTOR J753
Yeah now they didn't do um a cholesterol.

PATIENT J753
Oh okay but they did the uh.

DOCTOR J753
They did the prostate, the kidney and liver and um electrolytes.

PATIENT J753
Hmm.

DOCTOR J753
But no cholesterol and @@@ since you started on that medication @@@.

PATIENT J753
Yeah he said it wasn't, I think he said it was around 202 or maybe it was 220, maybe it was 220.

DOCTOR J753
It was 208 here.

PATIENT J753
Oh okay.

DOCTOR J753
But for you we want it significantly lower than that, particularly the LDL which is the bad cholesterol.

PATIENT J753
Okay.

DOCTOR J753
Come on up here, I'll take a listen to you.

PATIENT J753
Okay.  I got the results of the CAT scan; I had the CAT scan done.

DOCTOR J753
What for?

PATIENT J753
Cause when I was here uh, doing an evaluation for the Agent Orange, they wanted me to take a chest x-ray and something showed up on the chest x-ray.

DOCTOR J753
Oh yeah.

PATIENT J753
So uh this is like the third CAT scan I've had and they've been pretty much unchanged I guess since the first one.

DOCTOR J753
Can I make a copy of this?

PATIENT J753
You can keep that.

DOCTOR J753
Okay thanks.

PATIENT J753
Yeah I had them make a copy so I could bring one here.

DOCTOR J753
Okay.

PATIENT J753
The other thing the doctor said that I had gallstones.

DOCTOR J753
Yes you do.  A lot of people do.

PATIENT J753
So it's you know and they says you know you got gallstones.  I'm like really.  I says you know.

DOCTOR J753
A lot of people have them and they never have symptoms.

PATIENT J753
Yeah.

DOCTOR J753
They never cause problems and so we don't mess with them.  That's the problem you go looking for stuff and find stuff.

PATIENT J753
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J753
Would you be able to roll this up for me?

PATIENT J753
Sure.  I don't know if I can get it high enough or not.  I could take it off if you want.

DOCTOR J753
@@@.  

PATIENT J753
NAME gave me something for a research thing when I saw him today.  You know what I'm going to take this off.

DOCTOR J753
@@@ the Agent Orange thing.

PATIENT J753
I've heard @@@.  Something about the @@@ monitor that.

DOCTOR J753
Yeah.  Often when you have an infection in your lungs, you know you'll have a pneumonia at sometime in your life.

PATIENT J753
Oh.

DOCTOR J753
Or you might get some scar tissue in there and it builds up.  It looks funny on the x-ray, so we tell people, I don't know that that is, so we'll going to check, usually it's nothing.

PATIENT J753
But the prostate was good, that’s something.  It's like you know, sometimes I get that a urinating during a lot of the...

DOCTOR J753
Hold on a second. So you're telling me you have some urine symptoms?

PATIENT J753
Yeah like uh, well the last couple of days I kind of had the chills and stuff a little bit and I've been going to the washroom quite a bit in the last couple days and I got uh.

DOCTOR J753
Is it burning?

PATIENT J753
No.

DOCTOR J753
No blood in your urine?

PATIENT J753
No I don't notice any blood.

DOCTOR J753
Okay.  We'll do a urine test today.  Deep breath. @@@.  

PATIENT J753
Whey they took my temperature, they said it was 97, so.

DOCTOR J753
That’s good. That’s a little bit low, actually.

PATIENT J753
Yeah that is low.  I figured 96.8 but its 98.6 isn't it?

DOCTOR J753
Yeah.

PATIENT J753
There you go, that's why I'm not a doctor.  @@@.

DOCTOR J753
Uh-huh.  Alright, well your blood tests were very good.  I think @@@ I'll have you come in, the same thing like you did this time, maybe a week before you come in.

PATIENT J753
Okay.

DOCTOR J753
And we'll plan on doing that four months from now.

PATIENT J753
But continue on with the metformin right?

DOCTOR J753
Uh-huh, yeah.

PATIENT J753
Like I said I been taking it, generally I'm taking like one a day.

DOCTOR J753
I think you can stay on it.

PATIENT J753
Is it working out that way though, doing the one?

DOCTOR J753
We'll just do one blood test today and then I'll call you if there are any changes.  Do you want to do it on your way out?

PATIENT J753
Sure.  Cause I remember at one time I think I was taking two of the metformin, I was taking some other medicine, it wasn't metformin it was something else and I was really getting like the sweats and constant urinating and stuff and they told me to stop taking the medicine.

DOCTOR J753
Okay.  Well, that could be probably because the blood sugar was too high or too low with the sugar.

PATIENT J753
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J753
I'm not quite sure though.   This test that we're going to do today will help us get a sense about that.

PATIENT J753
Okay.

DOCTOR J753
Have you seen an eye doctor in the last year?

PATIENT J753
Yeah as a matter of fact I had the test here.

DOCTOR J753
Well there you go.

PATIENT J753
Yeah they said it was, they said it looked pretty good.  That's what she told me, I don't know.

DOCTOR J753
Yeah it looks likes everything was okay too.

PATIENT J753
She said, I told her I just use the readers you know for like reading the newspaper or something, small print stuff and she said that's fine.

DOCTOR J753
Alright I'll be right back.

PATIENT J753
Alright.
