I listen to some of these guys over there, these obese guys over there and when they say 2000 calories a day and one guy says you mean I can have 2000 calories a meal and they say no it's 2000 for the whole day.  It was funny to listen to some of these guys.

DOCTOR A976
Oh yeah.

PATIENT A976
How they can't quit smoking and how they can't quit this and you know when they talk about the portion size like and they're like there's no way I can survive on that and you can, you can technically survive on that.  It's just that getting I think the body shrunk down a little bit.

DOCTOR A976
Where was that?

PATIENT A976
Elk Grove Village. Barrington Orthopedics Surgery.

DOCTOR A976
@@@.

PATIENT A976
That was an ACL tear.

DOCTOR A976
Well how did that happen?

PATIENT A976
Well to be honest, we drove out to Iowa for Thanksgiving, drove back was great, got out of the truck was great, went to sleep was great, woke up the next morning and I couldn't walk.  I guess it tore in a couple of spots @@@.

DOCTOR A976
@@@.

PATIENT A976
Fantastic.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.

PATIENT A976
But there for a while I was getting problem, except a @@@ fluid was building up and they went up and drained it, the orthopedists drained it twice right.  Uh I also @@@ went and ran a test on it so they recommend me to a pain therapist.

DOCTOR A976
Okay so you're doing that with Elk Grove Village?

PATIENT A976
Uh yeah.

DOCTOR A976
What hospital is that?

PATIENT A976
Alexian Brothers.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.  So is that where you're doing physical therapy?

PATIENT A976
Right, I finished physical therapy @@@.

DOCTOR A976
Yeah okay.

PATIENT A976
Uh so they sent me to a pain @@@ building up the fluid and they are at 455 South Roselle Road, I remember the pain specialist and they took the fluid out and they sent it out and found out it was very high in uric acid.

DOCTOR A976
Oh okay so.

PATIENT A976
So they recommended pills for me, @@@, 0.6 twice a day.

DOCTOR A976
Is it colchicine?

PATIENT A976
Yeah them little purple pills?

DOCTOR A976
Yeah colchicine.

PATIENT A976
Yeah.

DOCTOR A976
Uh-huh.  I don’t know why @@@.

PATIENT A976
That was what was on the bottle.

DOCTOR A976
Hmm.  Okay.  @@@.  Did they say you had gout?

PATIENT A976
Yeah, well that acid was so high and it was not leaving, so the gout was there so.

DOCTOR A976
So okay, so you're on colchicine and how is your leg now?

PATIENT A976
Fantastic.  Never felt better.

DOCTOR A976
You said that was 0.6 mg tablet.

PATIENT A976
Yes, yeah, twice a day.  If @@@ can I get that prescription through the VA?

DOCTOR A976
Yeah.  I just want to make sure it's the right medication though.

PATIENT A976
It's a little purple pill.

DOCTOR A976
I think it is yeah.  It's called Colcar, it's actually the same thing as colchicine.

PATIENT A976
Okay, okay.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.  

PATIENT A976
So then after that went, the only reason I went back was for them to take blood out, check blood and I was very deficient on vitamin D.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.

PATIENT A976
So they started me on vitamin D 2000 per day.

DOCTOR A976
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A976
And then once a week another one at 50,000.

DOCTOR A976
Okay yeah, yeah, yeah.  So vitamin D, you’re taking what?

PATIENT A976
2000 per day.

DOCTOR A976
Yeah and then the shot.

PATIENT A976
And then once a week and I usually take it on Friday 50,000.

DOCTOR A976
And do you okay.  Do you have @@@?

PATIENT A976
I don't think so.  They said even being out in the sun I would not get enough vitamin D to bring it down.

DOCTOR A976
Do you have like a lab value of your low vitamin D?

PATIENT A976
I don't have it with me here.  I can get it from them.

DOCTOR A976
You need this vitamin D cause I would not have checked the vitamin D level before giving you this.

PATIENT A976
They did over there, it was way down, but I don't remember where it was.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.  Alright um.

PATIENT A976
It was very low.

DOCTOR A976
Do you get it from the VA?

PATIENT A976
If I can. @@@ refills.  @@@ to do the blood work before the appointment so I did it on the 10th.  

DOCTOR A976
Alright.

PATIENT A976
The only I asked them, at that time, about doing the urethra test, the acid test.

DOCTOR A976
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A976
And I got a copy of it yesterday and I didn't see it on there.

DOCTOR A976
@@@.

PATIENT A976
And I asked them because that's when they found out that that.

DOCTOR A976
Did you call, did I tell you?  They tell me so I have to put the order in.

PATIENT A976
Okay so talk to NAME the nurse.

DOCTOR A976
I need to be the one to order it okay.

PATIENT A976
She said oh no problem we'll have it put on there.  I still fast today so if you want to take more blood today you can.  For the vitamin D @@@.  @@@.

DOCTOR A976
You know, if you're @@@ and you're not having any symptoms right now I don't think, @@@.

PATIENT A976
Okay.

DOCTOR A976
Cause I mean if you're having like active infection or if you're actually having pain then we'll get it.

PATIENT A976
Okay well, whatever was in that pill; I don't think I always thought it was old age.  @@@ but I guess @@@ gout is and I feel ambitious, you know it's like oh my God, what's in that pill that makes me feel so good and I know it's an expensive pill and I didn't know if I could get that through the VA or not.

DOCTOR A976
@@@.

PATIENT A976
The other joints, they hurt a little bit but then it’s old age creeping in @@@ not a problem you know.  And they went back and says no, they called up right away and said you could see the crystals in the urine right there, like you have a very high @@@.

DOCTOR A976
Cause your cholesterol level is high.  @@@.  Are still only taking half pills right?

PATIENT A976

DOCTOR A976
@@@.

PATIENT A976
67.

DOCTOR A976
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A976
@@@

DOCTOR A976
@@@

PATIENT A976
The pneumonia shot, the booster @@@ she wants to know.

DOCTOR A976
Did you get it before?

PATIENT A976
I think you got to know @@@.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.

PATIENT A976
@@@ on the record.  @@@ booster.

DOCTOR A976
I don't know @@@.  Let me know if, we'll go through it @@@.

PATIENT A976
Okay, okay.  Somewhere in there @@@ red flag records.

DOCTOR A976
Oh.

PATIENT A976
Check that and see what the doctor @@@ to give me the shot or not.

DOCTOR A976
Uh-huh.  Okay, so your HDL, your good cholesterol has come down a little bit, it’s 29 and it should be around 40 okay, so it needs to be higher.

PATIENT A976
But it's coming down and not going up.

DOCTOR A976
Yeah and lipids should be going up cause we know it sounds weird @@@ this is the good one and it should go up okay.  So what I'm going to do for that is that you're on niacin right?

PATIENT A976
Right.

DOCTOR A976
So you're taking niacin 500 mg?

PATIENT A976
500 right.

DOCTOR A976
We can do 1000 mg and see how you do.

PATIENT A976
Okay.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.  Okay and do you take aspirin before that?

PATIENT A976
Yes.

DOCTOR A976
Okay good, make sure you do that.

PATIENT A976
Yeah.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.

PATIENT A976
So the good went down and the bad up.

DOCTOR A976
Yeah but the bad went up to 110 but it's not like your goal should be less than 130.

PATIENT A976
Okay.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.  It is.

PATIENT A976
Okay.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.  You know, we also, for everybody that has cholesterol, it's @@@ go up on your medication, it depends on the specific person.  So we have to go through you risk factors for developing coronary artery disease before I can change @@@ some of the medication

PATIENT A976
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR A976
But each patient's goal is different so I'm going to get @@@ refills now and then um what I'm going to do next is kind of adjust the medication accordingly.

PATIENT A976
Okay.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.  It's kind of like difficult @@@ requiremens.

PATIENT A976
Ah.

DOCTOR A976
So you're 67 is that right?

PATIENT A976
@@ yes.

DOCTOR A976
Yes.

PATIENT A976
I'll be 67 in September.

DOCTOR A976
Okay so age @@@, the blood pressure matters, @@@ cholesterol matters, your HDL is 29 and you are on blood pressure, you don't smoke right?

PATIENT A976
Nope.

DOCTOR A976
You don't have diabetes.

PATIENT A976
Nope.

DOCTOR A976
So I think I'll just keep it the way it is for now and see how you do.

PATIENT A976
See how I do, okay.

DOCTOR A976
We go up.  Cause you were on 80 before right?

PATIENT A976
Yes.

DOCTOR A976
I would go up just a little bit to 40 and just keep you on that because I think we'd just have better control with the 40.

PATIENT A976
Let’s do that then.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.  @@@ niacin at all cause that's going to affect your HDL @@@, so we'll keep you on 40 @@@. 

PATIENT A976
Okay.

DOCTOR A976
We have that done.  Let's see what else.  @@@ and we did your cholesterol already right?

PATIENT A976
Right.

DOCTOR A976
So we talked about your weight. Which is great.

PATIENT A976
@@@ it's supposed to be down to like 117 @@@.  I think I need to do more exercising and burn it off that way.

DOCTOR A976
Yeah.

PATIENT A976
I think I've learned my portion size and now I just get the exercise in and @@@ like that.  I've been wanting to do that goal @@@.  And I can @@@.

DOCTOR A976
And then we ought to, so we kind of check the PSA levels and the last one in February @@@ checking it right?

PATIENT A976
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR A976
Um so your PSA is 1.37 um and in the past they were a little bit lower.  Just so you know, that doesn't mean anything in terms of its dangerous and all okay.

PATIENT A976
Okay.

DOCTOR A976
It just means that it's higher um and I just wanted to ask you do you have any symptoms at all.  Like are you feeling like um, do you feel like you have urination at all?

PATIENT A976
I do get up like twice a night.

DOCTOR A976
Okay and is that bothersome to you?

PATIENT A976
Not really.

DOCTOR A976
No.

PATIENT A976
I could probably, @@@.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.

PATIENT A976
It's that I'll get up from 10 o'clock around 1:23 @@@ early in the morning and then at 4 o'clock or 4:30 something like that @@@.  

DOCTOR A976
Okay.

PATIENT A976
@@@ it doesn't seem like it's a lot, I mean it's enough to go but it's just like, why wake me up.  @@@

DOCTOR A976
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A976
But @@@.

DOCTOR A976
Okay.  If it gets worse, we can always start you on medication if you’re willing to try it.

PATIENT A976
Okay.

DOCTOR A976

PATIENT A976
