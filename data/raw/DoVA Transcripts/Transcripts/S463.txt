Okay.  Um.  How long have you been on the Prilosec now, two weeks?

PATIENT S463
Uh about a week and a half.

DOCTOR S463
About a week and a half.

PATIENT S463
The instructions say it's a two week course.

DOCTOR S463
Okay.

PATIENT S463
Like once a day.

DOCTOR S463
And do you feel like it has helped?

PATIENT S463
Yeah.  I think it has helped.  Because I had real bad vomiting last month.

DOCTOR S463
Okay.

PATIENT S463
And that's gone away.

DOCTOR S463
Why were you having so much vomiting? From the cough then?

PATIENT S463
From the cough yeah.  Yeah.  @@@ time I’d eat a meal.

DOCTOR S463
Okay.

PATIENT S463
You know even if I had Gatorade or something, it's enough to cause me to vomit.

DOCTOR S463
Uh-huh.  Are there any other issues or?

PATIENT S463
Uh no.

DOCTOR S463
@@@.

PATIENT S463
Just uh, I still have the cough you know.

DOCTOR S463
How often do you, do you find yourself waking up at night when you cough?

PATIENT S463
No.  Now last month, at times I’d wake up in the middle of the night, I’d be coughing a lot.

DOCTOR S463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S463
I just haven’t had that problem lately.

DOCTOR S463
@@@.

PATIENT S463
Really no reason it's a dry hacking cough.

DOCTOR S463
Any fevers, chills?

PATIENT S463
No. I may have had some chills last month during the worst part of it but, that hasn't been a factor lately.

DOCTOR S463
Okay.  How long have you had the cough now?

PATIENT S463
Uh I've had this cough for weeks now.  In fact my first time I came in was early January but I was diagnosed with acid reflux.  I think it was in 2008.

DOCTOR S463
So has it been at least one month with the cough?

PATIENT S463
Uh yes.

DOCTOR S463
Okay.  Are you a smoker?

PATIENT S463
No I've never smoked.

DOCTOR S463
Okay.  @@@ I think we should go ahead and do a chest x-ray.

PATIENT S463
Okay.

DOCTOR S463
Um I mean you're right it's probably your reflux I don't want to miss anything.

PATIENT S463
Uh-huh, right.

DOCTOR S463
Have a seat up here.  Uh any chest pain, shortness of breath?

PATIENT S463
No.  Now when the cough is really bad, it's in my chest.

DOCTOR S463
Chest yeah.

PATIENT S463

DOCTOR S463
Nausea, vomiting, but not recently right?

PATIENT S463

DOCTOR S463
Any diarrhea?

PATIENT S463
Uh no.

PATIENT S463

It wasn't that long.  I think this was back in 1995.

DOCTOR S463
@@@.

PATIENT S463
And I was non-active. I was doing training with the military back then, so I don't think it would show up in any military records.

When it was bad, but it was probably @@@.

DOCTOR S463
You've had the reflux disease for how long now?

PATIENT S463
I was diagnosed with it about 2008, late 2008.

DOCTOR S463
Late 2008. Have you had coughing fits like this before?

PATIENT S463
Yeah and some previous years.

DOCTOR S463
You have.

PATIENT S463
I've had some really bad coughs.

DOCTOR S463
Okay.

PATIENT S463
In 2007 I had a really bad cough and that may have been a negative thing from the flu shot.

DOCTOR S463
Were you sick before the coughing just started?  I mean did you feel like you got really sick and then you just had the cough that kind of hung around or no?

PATIENT S463
This cough just kind of, it comes and goes.

DOCTOR S463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S463
So now earlier this month it started uh New Year’s Day I did a 5-K run.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Hi PATIENT.

PATIENT S463
How you doing?

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Good, good, good.  I'm DOCTOR, one of the supervising doctors.

PATIENT S463
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
So you are in pretty good health?

PATIENT S463
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Cool. But you've been coughing.

PATIENT S463
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
And you teach, you're a teacher?

PATIENT S463
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Great.  Um where do you teach?

PATIENT S463
Uh I work as a substitute teacher so uh I go to a lot of different schools.  My area is secondary social studies.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Gotcha, gotcha.  Um and um do you live with family or by yourself?

PATIENT S463
By myself.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Alright and um how have you been feeling generally?  I mean do you feel like you're in good health, do you feel like you're?

PATIENT S463
I feel that I'm in good health.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S463
But now, for this last month I've been pretty miserable from the cough and it's just uh.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
And have you had a cold with that?

PATIENT S463
There was a cold with it as well.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S463
Besides, I'm probably all healed from the cold.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Do you have any allergies?

PATIENT S463
None that I know of.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Okay um and um have you ever had a cough like this before?

PATIENT S463
Yes.  I was diagnosed with acid reflux.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S463
In 2008.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S463
And so @@@ things like that, a dry hacking cough before.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Yeah. Do you know what brings it on?  

PATIENT S463
I'm not sure, I think it’s related to acid reflux.  Um in early 2005 I had a really bad cough.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Uh-huh.

PATIENT S463
Like this.  It could have been a reaction from the flu shot, I'm not entirely sure.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
@@@ now.

PATIENT S463
No I'm fine.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
So you think it was seasonal, does it happen at certain times of the year?

PATIENT S463
More often in winter than other times.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Does cold air bring it on?

PATIENT S463
It could.  It sure could.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Okay.  Um cause I'm wondering some people get a little bit of asthma with the cold air.

PATIENT S463
And now that I think of it, when I'm exposed to cold air I have a tendency to cough more.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Uh-huh, uh-huh.  @@@ Can you lean forward?

PATIENT S463
Sure.

DOCTOR S463
Good.  Take a breath in, out, again, out hard, out hard, breathe deep, out, one more time out.  Okay keep going in and out, that's good, again.  Alright that’s good.  I don't hear a wheeze.  @@@.  What I'm really wondering is would he benefit from, could he be having like a mild cough variant to reactive airway disease which people get in the winter.  I know kids get it all the time.  Um have you ever used an inhaler before?

PATIENT S463
I've tried it yeah before, but it's been a really long time.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR S463
Do you want to do the inhaler?

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Yeah, try that and @@@ prn.  Albuterol with a spacer; basically it's just a dilator, bronchodilator.

PATIENT S463
Uh-huh,

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Cause personally I don't think reflux would be causing this particular kind of cough and you know, it just doesn’t seem right.  Um I don't think he's got tuberculosis.  Uh I don't think he's got, it doesn’t really fit for allergies.  It’s been a little bit long for post-viral cough, but you know you could have this pattern of getting this in the wintertime, I would try him with just an inhaler – see if it helps.

FIRST DOCTOR S463
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Because you know you have to have a very significant amount of you know of bronchospasms before you start to wheeze, it's not from your actual cough.

PATIENT S463
Uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
So we're going to try you on an inhaler.

PATIENT S463
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
And see if that doesn't actually help.

PATIENT S463
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
And then maybe we'll see you back in a couple weeks and see how you're doing.

PATIENT S463
Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR S463
Good luck.

PATIENT S463
Thank you doctor.

FIRST DOCTOR S463

FIRST DOCTOR S463

PATIENT S463
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR S463
And then we'll have you come back in a month.

PATIENT S463
Alright.

FIRST DOCTOR S463

PATIENT S463
Do I have an appointment for a chest x-ray?

FIRST DOCTOR S463
