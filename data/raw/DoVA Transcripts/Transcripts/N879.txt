So does it feel like everything when you stand up drains out of your head?

PATIENT N879
Yeah right.  You're standing there and every thing’s like whoa.

DOCTOR N879
Okay.

PATIENT N879
Whoa.

DOCTOR N879
Just to kind of you define and be sure, it's kind of more sounds that like when you get up things kind of drain out of your head it feels like rather than sitting there and then feeling like the room's unstable and like spinning around.

PATIENT N879
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N879
Is that correct, it's more of the first one than the second one?

PATIENT N879
Yeah.

DOCTOR N879
Sometimes when standing.

PATIENT N879
Yeah like when I was waiting for the bus to come over here.

DOCTOR N879

PATIENT N879
I don't know.  I go to bed, cause I'm tired and then I'm laying there and I can't sleep.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.

PATIENT N879
And then @@@ one night, told you about getting that pain in my stomach.

DOCTOR N879
Okay, now tell me a little more about that pain.  It's in your lower abdomen?

PATIENT N879
It's right up through here.

DOCTOR N879
Okay.

PATIENT N879
See right here.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.  Does it stay there, or does it radiate like up into your, higher?

PATIENT N879
Yeah it goes into my back.

DOCTOR N879
Goes around back.

PATIENT N879
Yeah and into my legs too.

DOCTOR N879
Okay, okay.

PATIENT N879
Back and legs.  Like somebody grabbed me, like something going in there and grabbing.  It's not really that bad.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.

PATIENT N879
But the times that it, it's sort of like somebody's just grabbed me and they just like squeezed.

DOCTOR N879
Is that associated at all with food?  Like is it better when you eat or worse when you eat?

PATIENT N879
Probably uh, I don't know.  When I eat it doesn't bother me really.  It's just when I am doing nothing, I walk every day.  I walk two to three miles a day and I come back and I'm okay and then I sit down for a little bit and then all of a sudden I started getting that.

DOCTOR N879
Okay.

PATIENT N879
Like right now, it's starting to bother me, go right through like somebody just grabbed me.

DOCTOR N879
Okay.  Alright.  Are you having any pain going down into like your scrotum at all?

PATIENT N879
No, there's nothing down there.  It's in the legs.

DOCTOR N879
Is it in the front part of the leg?

PATIENT N879
Yeah it's on both sides.

DOCTOR N879
Both sides.

PATIENT N879
Yeah both sides and in my back.  

DOCTOR N879
And it is the left side of the back?

PATIENT N879
Yeah.

DOCTOR N879
You notice any changes in your urine at all?

PATIENT N879
@@@

DOCTOR N879
Painful?

PATIENT N879
No, yeah it was burning oh about a week ago.

DOCTOR N879
Right.

PATIENT N879
Because I went to the bathroom and it was kind of burning and I know it wasn't because of alcohol because I don't drink no more so it's uh you know like.

DOCTOR N879
Any blood in the urine at all?

PATIENT N879
No I didn't see none.  Right now oh my God this thing hurts.

DOCTOR N879
Okay.

PATIENT N879
I thought maybe I was getting that diverticulitis again.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.  Is that what it feels like?

PATIENT N879
Yeah because that's how it started out the last time I came into the hospital.  Because I came into the hospital in October of last year.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.

PATIENT N879
I thought it was my pancreas again cause I had fallen off the wagon but well I hadn't been drinking that much.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.

PATIENT N879
It was just a few and then the doctor sent me home, said you're okay.

DOCTOR N879
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N879
And then I came back the very following day.

DOCTOR N879
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N879
And they had me drinking I guess that stuff and they took a test and they found out I had that diverticulitis.

DOCTOR N879
Wow okay.

PATIENT N879
I couldn't believe the doctor sent me home.  I was in pain.  I said why am I going home if I'm in pain?

DOCTOR N879
Okay.

PATIENT N879
And then I came back, when I came back in then that's when they diagnosed me with that and they fixed it @@@.  I said no man I ain't drinking no more, doing nothing.  I been eating healthy, except once in a while I'll eat a burger here and there other than that you know.

DOCTOR N879
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N879
Everybody likes burgers and I'm not unusual.

DOCTOR N879
Alright.

PATIENT N879
But uh I eat a lot of salads.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.  Okay.  I'm taking a look back; it looks like your blood counts have been a little bit low or were a little bit low during that hospitalization.  They've been pretty low in the past too.

PATIENT N879
Right.  

DOCTOR N879
Normally some of that it might be due to the alcohol so I think probably number one we could check and see if that's still the case.  If you're still having low sugar or low blood counts okay.

PATIENT N879
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N879
Um, number two we'll take a look and see what we think about um those pains.  So why don't you hop up over here and let me take a look and a listen okay.

PATIENT N879
See.

DOCTOR N879
A little dizzy just doing that?

PATIENT N879
Yeah doing that.

DOCTOR N879
Okay.  Sounds @@@.

PATIENT N879
Right.

DOCTOR N879
Deep breath.  Just breathe normally.  Can I get you to lay back on the table?  

PATIENT N879
Oh man that hurts.

DOCTOR N879
Can I get you to untuck your shirt?

PATIENT N879
Yeah.  

DOCTOR N879
Let's press, uh let me take a look @@@ okay.

PATIENT N879
@@@.

DOCTOR N879
What's that?

PATIENT N879
It's a little tender right up in that area.

DOCTOR N879
Alright, a little pressure over here, okay.

PATIENT N879
Oh I don't like that.  Yeah oh right there, oh my God yeah right there.

DOCTOR N879
It's mostly down here?

PATIENT N879
Yeah right.  

DOCTOR N879
Alright.  Stay laying down.  I'll check your blood pressure.  A couple different ways, with you lying down and with you standing up okay.

PATIENT N879
Okay.  Do you think it could be a reoccurrence of that shit?

DOCTOR N879
Of the diverticulitis?

PATIENT N879
Yeah.

DOCTOR N879
It could be, definitely could be.  I want to check some blood tests to help me see if that's what's going on.

PATIENT N879
Oh.

DOCTOR N879
You haven't been having any fevers so it's kind of suggests that.

PATIENT N879
@@@.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.

PATIENT N879
Usually I don't complain.

DOCTOR N879
No it's alright.

PATIENT N879
It's like man right now it's like I can feel it in the @@@ my side.

DOCTOR N879
Okay.  I'm going to take a listen to your @@@ too okay.  Take a deep breath in and hold it.  Good.  Turn to the left side.  Again take a deep breath in and hold it.  

PATIENT N879
Wow.

DOCTOR N879
@@@.  Okay.  Are you okay?

PATIENT N879
My back.

DOCTOR N879
Okay go ahead and sit up for me.  No swelling @@@.

PATIENT N879
No.  It's just like the pain I've been having.

DOCTOR N879
I'm gonna look in your mouth, open up for me.

PATIENT N879
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N879
Say ah.

PATIENT N879
Ah.  I gotta go and see the doctor for the teeth @@@ and I can't afford it.

DOCTOR N879
Couldn't afford it.

PATIENT N879
They wanted like $350 and I'm not working so what do I do?

DOCTOR N879
I'm going to hold your arm and just hold still okay.  Okay.

PATIENT N879
I urinate a lot.

DOCTOR N879
You have been.

PATIENT N879
Yeah a lot, a lot.  Good thing I took one of those bottles home with me from the last time I went to the hospital.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.

PATIENT N879
I sleep on the second floor and the bathroom is downstairs.  I just use that and I've been urinating a lot too.  And sometimes I don't even have to drink anything.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.

PATIENT N879
Does diabetes do this?

DOCTOR N879
Yeah diabetes can do it if it's uncontrolled but your blood sugars look like you've been doing okay.

PATIENT N879
Yeah.

DOCTOR N879
Um, I think we probably just need to check a couple blood tests today to see if we can figure out what's going on.  Check your blood counts and a set of electrolytes, including liver levels and check your pancreas.  I don't think that's what going on but I think we should probably just check how given that you've had problems with it in the past.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
Um I would tell you you're talking about the area it's concerning for diverticulitis, like that's what we normally think about you having pain but without any fevers, chills or sweats.  Your exam @@@ pain doesn't feel like diverticular pain.

PATIENT N879
Hmm.

DOCTOR N879
I think probably what we're talking about and I do want to check your urine as well, make sure you don't have a urinary tract infection.

PATIENT N879
Yeah.

DOCTOR N879
And maybe a little infection in your kidney back there.  Um so we'll do all that stuff today.

PATIENT N879
Alright.

DOCTOR N879
Um and then follow that up um before you get out of here so we know what's going on okay.  Um.

PATIENT N879
Alright good.

DOCTOR N879
Alright.  Let me see if there's anything else we need @@@. 

PATIENT N879
You ordered my medicine, right?

DOCTOR N879
What's that?

PATIENT N879
Reorder the medicine for the diabetes.

DOCTOR N879
Uh I'll reorder it yeah.

PATIENT N879
Cause I only got enough for I think four days, two pills.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.  So right now uh you're taking lisinopril and metformin only?

PATIENT N879
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N879
On a daily basis.

PATIENT N879
Right.

DOCTOR N879
You been taking half a tablet of metformin?

PATIENT N879
Right, it's like 1000 mg I think.

DOCTOR N879
The whole tablet, so half would be like 500.

PATIENT N879
Right.

DOCTOR N879
But it's locked up on me right now for a second.

PATIENT N879
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N879
Now are you taking an aspirin every day?

PATIENT N879
Yeah.

DOCTOR N879
Alright good. 

PATIENT N879
81 I think.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah one a day of baby, excellent.  Um okay.  And you know we definitely need to figure out.  I think the dizziness that you're having is probably related to whatever is going on in your stomach okay.  Um uh we can probably, let's see your blood pressure today was 108/67.  I still want you to take that low dose of the lisinopril 20 mg.

PATIENT N879
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N879
Um but I want you to make sure you're drinking enough water uh and doing things like that okay.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
Um I think probably if there is anything, infection or whatever going down in your belly though, that's going to explain the dizziness that you've been having.  Um that’s what we’ll check with today.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
And see if there's anything like that going on.  So I put in this @@@ diabetes medication and then we'll get some blood draws.  @@@ not then I'll have you go downstairs and do it and then I'll call you as soon as I get the results.

PATIENT N879
Oh okay.  @@@ I just don't want to go back in the hospital again.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah I know I hear you.

PATIENT N879
But it feels good to not drink anymore.

DOCTOR N879
Does it?

PATIENT N879
Yeah.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah I think that's a great health move for you.

PATIENT N879
Yeah.

DOCTOR N879
And you're really going to reap the benefits of that okay.

PATIENT N879
Oh I feel a lot better with that now so.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.

PATIENT N879
No I see all these people that are out there drunk and that used to be me.

DOCTOR N879
Used to be you.

PATIENT N879
Yeah.

DOCTOR N879
@@@.

PATIENT N879
Acting stupid and I'm like oh okay.

DOCTOR N879
Alright.  Alright you need to hold on for one second.  If the guy is out here to do blood tests, I'll have you come out with me and get those done here but if he's not, just wait in her okay.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
Alright I'll be right back.

PATIENT N879
Alright.

DOCTOR N879
Good to see you again.

PATIENT N879
Yeah.  And when do you want me to come back again?

DOCTOR N879
Uh we'll get you to come back and depending on what we find will be one issue and then otherwise we'll make sure we're keeping a close eye on you and make sure every thing’s pretty stable, probably like three or four months.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
And then.

PATIENT N879
Yeah cause last time I was supposed to see you you cancelled out on me.

DOCTOR N879
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N879
That was way before I went into the hospital again then.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah.

PATIENT N879
Then they kept on asking me well who's your doctor, primary doctor and I said DOCTOR.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT N879
And then they go, then finally.  Then I got cancelled out last month and they rescheduled me for today.

DOCTOR N879
Yep exactly.  So I was happy I saw your name pop back up on the list today.  

PATIENT N879
Yeah.

DOCTOR N879
Definitely.  

PATIENT N879
Yeah you never know, I'm doing a lot better.  How is DOCTOR doing?

DOCTOR N879
He's doing good.  He's one of our chief residents now.

PATIENT N879
Really.

DOCTOR N879
Yep, yep.  He's doing real well.

PATIENT N879
You tell him I said hello.

DOCTOR N879
I will.

PATIENT N879
Tell him no more drinking.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT N879
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  155:2  DOCTOR IN:  163:0)

DOCTOR N879
Alright, um I'm going to have you go downstairs and get those blood tests.  Go home after they're done, if there's anything abnormal with them, uh my biggest concern is a very mild case of diverticulitis.

PATIENT N879
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR N879
In which case we'll just give you a prescription, take it home.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
Um the other things I'm thinking maybe you have like a kidney stone, maybe there's a urinary tract infection, those types of things we can also treat as an outpatient.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
Now if things get worse, you start to get fevers, your pain gets worse, you have any falls or anything, come back into the hospital to the Emergency Department.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
Um but make sure you're taking, I know your dry out, make sure you're taking enough fluids.

PATIENT N879
Alright.

DOCTOR N879
Your blood pressure did go down when I had you standing up but not to the point where I need to give you any IV fluids.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
Just have a bottle of water around.

PATIENT N879
I'll get some water again.

DOCTOR N879
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT N879
I have to use the bathroom; you need to take my urine?

DOCTOR N879
Um go downstairs and then they’ll give you a cup.

PATIENT N879
Oh okay then I'll just wait till you tell me.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah just wait exactly okay.

PATIENT N879
And another thing you ordered for me right?

DOCTOR N879
I'm not going to order any of the medicines just yet.  I ordered the metformin for you.

PATIENT N879
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR N879
Yeah I ordered that and then we'll see if I need to give you any antibiotic.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
Okay.  Alright um, any questions?

PATIENT N879
No.  Doc thanks a lot.  

DOCTOR N879
Good to see you again.  I'm glad to hear you're doing well.

PATIENT N879
Well I hope you bring me back real soon cause I want to keep myself together.

DOCTOR N879
We'll do three months labs today okay.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
Alright, good to see you.

PATIENT N879
I have to make a stop.

DOCTOR N879
Just drop it off, there's probably going to be nobody there up front but just drop it on the desk up front.

PATIENT N879
And then where do I go downstairs and?

DOCTOR N879
Uh downstairs there's uh, you take those elevators and to the uh lobby and take a left.  Take the elevator to the front lobby, go down to the first floor, after you get there come out of the elevator and take a right and then it will be the first hallway on the right.

PATIENT N879
Okay.

DOCTOR N879
Go down to the end of that and that's the Lab.

PATIENT N879
And they got me on the system?

DOCTOR N879
