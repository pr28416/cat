PATIENT P921
And around 2 o'clock in the morning I woke up with the pain so I went to the hospital.  So I was in there for three days.

DOCTOR P921
And then what did they do for you?

PATIENT P921
Uh they gave me morphine for the pain.

DOCTOR P921

PATIENT P921
And uh gave it by IV.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.

PATIENT P921
And the swelling went down.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.

PATIENT P921

PATIENT P921
Uh that time I didn't wait, I already knew what it was.

DOCTOR P921
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P921
Because I had suffered pain twice.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.

Okay.

PATIENT P921
Uh they didn't give me anything that time; they said they couldn't give me anymore Cipro.

DOCTOR P921
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P921
And by that time I was already taking fiber.

DOCTOR P921
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P921
And that was helping me; I think it's been helping me now.

DOCTOR P921
Okay good so you're taking the fiber and are you having a bowel movement?

DOCTOR P921
Every day?

PATIENT P921

DOCTOR P921
Okay.  Uh before you had, before you started fiber were you constipated?

PATIENT P921
Yes.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.

PATIENT P921
They did that when I stopped taking the fiber, I'd get constipated.

DOCTOR P921

DOCTOR P921
And it just comes and goes.  How long does it last for?

PATIENT P921
Uh I think a couple of seconds.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.

PATIENT P921
Uh the thing is um when I went to the hospital, when they questioned that I had, just by @@@ touching me, it would hurt, okay.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.

PATIENT P921
Uh this last time uh they actually put their fingers pretty deep in there to where it bothered.

DOCTOR P921

PATIENT P921
And it really wasn't that bad.

DOCTOR P921
Wasn't that bad.

PATIENT P921
Yeah.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.

PATIENT P921
And the pain would come like maybe once an hour.

DOCTOR P921

DOCTOR P921
Um.  You've never had a colonoscopy or @@@.

PATIENT P921

DOCTOR P921
Is that right?

PATIENT P921
The hospital probably told me I have to go do it.

DOCTOR P921
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P921
But I ain't gonna do it because I don't have insurance.

DOCTOR P921
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P921
So they said I could wait till the VA covered it.

DOCTOR P921
Right.

PATIENT P921
And then get it.

DOCTOR P921
Uh-huh.  Um does anything or so besides the fiber are you taking any other medications?

PATIENT P921
Uh just like for heartburn cause I've been having like lots of heartburn lately.  I don't know why.

PATIENT P921
Cause I experimented, first I took the 75 and it wasn't doing anything.

DOCTOR P921
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P921
Then I doubled the dose to 150 and then that's what was helping me.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.

PATIENT P921

Oh okay.

DOCTOR P921
Okay and so you have an appointment with the GI doctors next week.

PATIENT P921
Yeah.

DOCTOR P921
Um, let me just go talk to my attending and I'll be right back okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  72:36  DOCTOR IN:  80:17)

DOCTOR P921
Okay, do you remember when your last tetanus shot was?

PATIENT P921
No.

DOCTOR P921
Have you had one in the last ten years do you think?

PATIENT P921
Hmm.

DOCTOR P921
If not we do a booster shot every ten years.

PATIENT P921
Oh.

DOCTOR P921
So uh you can actually get that done today.

PATIENT P921
Well yeah I guess.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT P921
Um when I came, @@@.

DOCTOR P921
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P921
I got the tuberculosis thing but I don't remember having them reading it.

DOCTOR P921
Was it a skin test?

PATIENT P921
Yeah.

DOCTOR P921
Okay um so.  Have you ever been exposed to anybody with TB like in your family that you know of?

PATIENT P921
No.

DOCTOR P921
Okay and so given that you are um, so you're from Mexico originally which is considered a high risk area.

PATIENT P921
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P921
And these are areas where they have TB there and also because you in the service that's why they normally do a screen test but if you're not having any symptoms of TB which is things like weight loss or cough, coughing up blood you know, night sweats, things like that.

PATIENT P921
Okay.

DOCTOR P921
Then we really don't.

PATIENT P921
Okay.

DOCTOR P921
Need to do anything, we could do a screening test @@@ if you've been exposed to TB.

PATIENT P921
Oh okay.

DOCTOR P921
Okay so you don't actually have any symptoms of having the disease.

PATIENT P921
Okay.

DOCTOR P921
Uh we may consider doing that later because if you've been exposed to it.

PATIENT P921
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P921
Um and that test is positive it can tell us that you may be at risk for getting the disease of TB later, so like the way TB works, you get exposed to it and then it kind of just hides out and then one day later reactivates and that's when you get the lung disease.  So we would treat you if you just showed, if the test is positive and it just showed that you were exposed to it.

PATIENT P921
Oh okay.

DOCTOR P921
Um we'd treat you with the medication for like nine months and then help with it or prevent it from actually ever getting to the real tuberculosis.

PATIENT P921
Okay.

DOCTOR P921
But let's focus on a couple of other things today.

PATIENT P921
Yeah.

DOCTOR P921
First @@@ and the TB skin test okay.

PATIENT P921
Okay.

DOCTOR P921
Oh the nurse, when you check in and usually every time the nurses, they do this, they have to ask you questions kind of a little checking system that we do so we help us catch things and um there were some questions in here regarding like your time in service thing you know uh that you've been having nightmares about your time in service, things like that.  Constantly guardful, watchful, easily startled, things like that and those can be symptoms of PTSD.  Have you ever heard of that before?

PATIENT P921
I've heard of it but never really.

DOCTOR P921
So it stands for post-traumatic stress disorder um and its, you know easily @@@ symptoms and disturbances and just from you're daily living but these questions sometimes can help me know uh if you want me to investigate, you know ask about those, so how do you feel I guess about your thoughts on these questions you know.  Do you feel like your thoughts are significantly affecting your daily life?  Do you feel depressed?

PATIENT P921
No I don't feel depressed.

DOCTOR P921
Do you feel like you need to, would you like to talk to somebody more about?

PATIENT P921
Uh.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.  Has this been going on since you left the service?

PATIENT P921
Um yeah I guess but it sort of, basically um when I came back.

DOCTOR P921
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P921
I just didn't feel right here.

DOCTOR P921
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P921
And I didn't want to be here, I wanted to go back but it took about a year um.  I would be taking, almost for a year, I was taking uh Nyquil to go to sleep cause I just couldn't go to sleep.  If I woke up, cause I went to sleep like for three hours and something would wake me up, I just could not go back to sleep.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.

PATIENT P921
So I would have to take like Nyquil to actually help me relax but now I can just sleep a full night.

DOCTOR P921
Okay.

PATIENT P921
And but other than that, I think I'm alright.

DOCTOR P921
So if anything changes you should let us know because we do have a lot of other things you know to help with that.

PATIENT P921
Okay.

DOCTOR P921
It's a very common experience so you know it's something that we need to try to have you treat.  So if anything changes just let me know.  Um in the meantime I do want to get some blood work from you.

PATIENT P921
Okay.

DOCTOR P921
So like I said the cholesterol level should be fasting.

PATIENT P921
Right.

DOCTOR P921
Since you're coming back in a week anyway.

PATIENT P921
Yeah.

DOCTOR P921
We can wait till then to do it.

PATIENT P921
Okay next time.

DOCTOR P921
That’s fine by me. I mean um you're appointment's at 8 a.m. so you may have to be the first one in line for the lab.

PATIENT P921
Okay.

DOCTOR P921
And then go upstairs or you can do it afterwards.

PATIENT P921
Well where's it at now?

DOCTOR P921
It's right down here on the first floor.

PATIENT P921
Okay.  So I show up over there first?

DOCTOR P921

DOCTOR P921
You tell them your name and your last four, they'll have the order, they'll see it.

PATIENT P921
Okay.

DOCTOR P921
And they can draw your blood.

PATIENT P921
Okay.

DOCTOR P921
Do you um your appointment's at 8 though so maybe you should go to the GI Clinic first so they can see you and then go down to the Lab.

PATIENT P921
Where is the GI Clinic.

DOCTOR P921
GI Clinic.

PATIENT P921
Where is it at?

DOCTOR P921
That's for the GI doctors that you have your appointment in a week for.

PATIENT P921
Oh gotcha.

DOCTOR P921
So they can talk about maybe doing the colonoscopy.

PATIENT P921
So go to the GI Clinic first?

DOCTOR P921
I would suggest doing that first so you don't get late for your appointment.  Um your appointment's at 8, so it's like the first appointment they have.

PATIENT P921
So I need to go to my appointment first then go to the Lab right?

DOCTOR P921

DOCTOR P921
So the more weight you can lose the better it's going to be in the back.  In the meantime you should definitely, you can use some Tylenol if you have significant pain but otherwise you know just doing exercising as you are, continue to do that cause keeping the muscles around your lower back strong helps prevent them from getting worse as well.
