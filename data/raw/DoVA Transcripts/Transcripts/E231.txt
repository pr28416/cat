DOCTOR153:

PATIENT153:	
I threw up the bad food, and I said hey, everything is perfect.  I am fine now.

DOCTOR153:	
Uh-huh.

PATIENT153:	
But they said no we worked through all of this stuff.

DOCTOR153:	
Yeah.

PATIENT153:

DOCTOR153:	
Exactly.  What’s the secret?

PATIENT153: 	
Huh?

DOCTOR153:	
What’s your secret?

PATIENT153:	
Just good food.

DOCTOR153:	
Good food, huh?

PATIENT153:	
Every morning.  Plenty of vitamin cereal…

DOCTOR153:	
Yeah.

PATIENT153:	
And bananas and blueberries.  You know?  Every morning.

DOCTOR153:	
That’s good.

PATIENT153:	
That is my foundation.

PATIENT153:	
Everything is wonderful.  I have no complaints about it.

DOCTOR153:	
Alright.  Do you need anything from me today specifically?

PATIENT153:	
Uh, not that I know of. 

DOCTOR153:	
Is there any other medications prescribed by your other DOCTOR153s that I don’t know about besides the vitamins and the Capsaicin cream?

PATIENT153:

DOCTOR153:	
Okay.  

PATIENT153:	
They are very little pills.  Very small ones.

DOCTOR153:	
Alright.

PATIENT153:	
There are two of them I take every morning.  One is the vitamin D and I think the other, I forget what it is . . .

DOCTOR153:	
Alright.  And uh, have you ever had a colonoscopy done before?

PATIENT153:	
Um, I don’t think so. Exactly what is that? 

DOCTOR153:	
Uh, you know where they use a camera to look up your butt, basically.

PATIENT153:	
No.

DOCTOR153:	
Look at your colon.

PATIENT153:	
Okay.

DOCTOR153:	
At this point, you’re 87, so. Probably not

PATIENT153:	
No, I had one put a finger, but that was all.

DOCTOR153:	
Okay.

PATIENT153:	
I guess that is a check for cancer?

DOCTOR153:	
Yeah, you can do that.  But at your age, probably wouldn’t be to aggressive about it.  No problems with your bowel movements or blood in stool?

PATIENT153:	
No, everything is normal.  As I say, I think the food I eat in the morning makes everything normal.

DOCTOR153:	
Yeah, but you do have osteoporosis.

PATIENT153:	
Yeah, that’s what the @@@.

DOCTOR153:	
Yeah.

PATIENT153:	
Maybe the vitamin D helps. @@@

DOCTOR153:

PATIENT153:

DOCTOR153:
