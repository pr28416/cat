DOCTOR N655
PATIENT.

PATIENT N655 
Over here.

DOCTOR N655
Oh yeah.

PATIENT N655
That's me.

DOCTOR N655
Alright nice to see you.

PATIENT N655
Good to see you too.

DOCTOR N655
Right in here.

PATIENT N655
Okay.

DOCTOR N655
Alright sir.  What brings you in here today?  Just a regular follow-up?

PATIENT N655
Just a regular call plus I need, I need to two appointments, two new appointments.  I need an appointment to my hearing, to get my ears checked on the 4th floor at the hearing station and plus I need a dermatologist appointment.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  What's your dermatologist appointment for?

PATIENT N655
I got an itch that's going on a month and a half and I can't seem to get rid of it, it just gets worse.

DOCTOR N655
Okay where have you noticed it?

PATIENT N655
Oh it's on the heel on both sides, sometimes all around the wrist, on the shoulder, on this arm here and this shoulder now.

DOCTOR N655
Okay what have you tried for it?

PATIENT N655
And right down here.

DOCTOR N655
What have you tried for it?

PATIENT N655
Huh?

DOCTOR N655
What have you tried for it?

PATIENT N655
I got all kinds of stuff.

DOCTOR N655
Creams and stuff.

PATIENT N655
It's stuff.  They gave me, I got a liquid that I put on it and it helps and I also bought some other itch.  I think I need an allergy, a good allergy pill or something inside.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT N655
It comes on me worse when I eat, after I eat.

DOCTOR N655
After you eat. 

PATIENT N655
It seem to attack other than that sometime I don't even notice I have an itch.

DOCTOR N655
Alright do you have uh, do you notice any rashes or anything?

PATIENT N655
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR N655
Does @@@ really itch or not?

PATIENT N655
It may be nerves cause sometimes I've been scratching on it a bit.

DOCTOR N655
So a couple uh a few months ago you came in with some swelling in your legs, how has that been doing?

PATIENT N655
It's doing pretty good.  I also had to come in because of the itching.  Twice I was given a different itch medicine to stop the itch.  It all helped, but there's nothing permanent.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
What are suggesting or think it is?

DOCTOR N655
Uh that's a good question um.  Back to your lastâ€¦ sometimes.

PATIENT N655
And see I went to see a dermatologist.

DOCTOR N655
Yeah.

PATIENT N655
I figured from what I explained to him, he was getting an idea as to what is happening.

DOCTOR N655
Yeah they have a little more experience with that.  We'll talk with DOCTOR and see if he has any information, if he has any ideas.  Um.

PATIENT N655
Would I be able to talk to DOCTOR before I leave here?

DOCTOR N655
Yeah I'll talk to him.

PATIENT N655
Oh good.

DOCTOR N655
At least um and then I'll tell him what's been going on so.

PATIENT N655
I have trouble sleeping.  I have to almost put the stuff all over my body in order to be able to get to sleep.

DOCTOR N655
And uh have you tried anything other than creams?  Did they ever give you a pill for the itching?  Or has it always been creams.

PATIENT N655
Say what?

DOCTOR N655
Have they ever given you a pill for the itching or has it always been creams?

PATIENT N655
No nothing to go inside, just something for the outside, an ointment and liquid type of stuff.  

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
And an itch cream called male something and I got two bottles of that and then I got an ointment, its hydro something that supposed to keep you from.

DOCTOR N655
Hydrocortisone?

PATIENT N655
Yes.

DOCTOR N655
Did that help some?

PATIENT N655
I don't know I haven't used much of it yet.

DOCTOR N655
Oh okay.  When did you get that?

PATIENT N655
I got that a week and a half ago I think when I was here.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  That was the uh.

PATIENT N655
I picked it up and the doctor who prescribed it said it might help it.

DOCTOR N655
The oncologist?  DOCTOR?

PATIENT N655
I can't say for sure.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  Um but you haven't used the cortisone cream much, the hydroxy cortisone?

PATIENT N655
Do I have any?

DOCTOR N655
Yeah the one they just started you on.

PATIENT N655
I orded it when I was here before but I found out I got enough now for about three weeks.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  Did they give it to you, have you been using it?

PATIENT N655
Uh I use it every day, I take one pill.

DOCTOR N655
What about the cream?

PATIENT N655
Oh the cream?

DOCTOR N655
Yeah.  

PATIENT N655
I haven't used the cream.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
I use that but the stuff seems to be doing pretty good when I put it on me.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  Well maybe what we'll do is give that cream a shot cause that cream usually stops itching.

PATIENT N655
Oh yeah?

DOCTOR N655
Yeah.  Um so I think that they were on the right track cause that's a good idea.

PATIENT N655
Is there anything that I take inside that might help?

DOCTOR N655
I'm not sure there is for the type of @@@.

PATIENT N655
I have a Benadryl or something like that that uh.

DOCTOR N655
Right.  The problem is that the Benadryl can also have other affects and can make you tired and kind of goofy and so we're.

PATIENT N655
I'm tired about this.

DOCTOR N655
Right.  We don't want to make that any worse.  Um and some of the reason you're tired is cause you haven't been sleeping too well.  I think the cream is a good way to go though for starters.  Um first off it feels pretty good if you're itching and it does decrease the itch a fair amount.

PATIENT N655
Well I'm trying to locate exactly what it is and get rid of it.

DOCTOR N655
Right.  So that's.

PATIENT N655
I'm checking my food.  I drank a whole lot of tea, all kinds of tea.  I quit all of it, all of a sudden, cause my daughter told me that's bad on my liver.  I said well it could be.  I said I don't have to have it.  I'm trying to check my sugar and my salt and trying to get an idea as to what's creating this.

DOCTOR N655
Yeah so it looks like it's not your liver um cause the last time I checked your liver that looked fine.  Sometimes that can cause some itching.  Um and you're not on it, sometimes some pain medications cause itching but it doesn't look like you're on any of those either.  So um not totally sure what it is but I think and we don't see any rashes.  If we saw rashes then Dermatology might be even, they have a lot more information for us.  Since it's just kind of a.

PATIENT N655
Well my skin now is a you know a funny color in the last month.

DOCTOR N655
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N655
It's giving signs and something like a puzzle or something.

DOCTOR N655
Yeah so we'll talk to DOCTOR.  I think we should give the cream that they prescribed you, the hydrocortisone cream.  I think we should give that a shot and if that doesn't do it then we can maybe get you a dermatology appointment.  But I'll talk to DOCTOR and see how he feels.  Um any problems with your heart?  Any chest pain, trouble breathing?

PATIENT N655
No I haven't.  I @@@ she never mentioned a concern with my heart too.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
In 08 I took an operation where they run a wire up from your legs.

DOCTOR N655
Yeah.

PATIENT N655
To your heart and it sort of stopped an intermittent condition.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
I didn't never get the full results of that and DOCTOR is still giving me a heart pill that relaxes my heart to a certain extent.

DOCTOR N655
Right.  So.

PATIENT N655
I got the operation, one of them wasn't necessary I guess.

DOCTOR N655
So what I'll do, let me see if I can bring up the report here.

PATIENT N655
I'd like to get more information on it.  Is it in my files?

DOCTOR N655
So it should be.  Let's see if it's in here.  I'll look a little bit further.  Back in June of 2008.  There we go.  

PATIENT N655
Do you think a dermatologist would be able to give a better idea as to what's happening?

DOCTOR N655
Well I'm not sure that they would without a rash.

PATIENT N655
I don't know whether I got a rash or not.

DOCTOR N655
Okay we can take a look.

PATIENT N655
Fine with me.

DOCTOR N655
Alright.  

PATIENT N655
Start right here where it itch and on the side and I been scratching and I might have a little rash right now.

DOCTOR N655
Yeah it looks a little bit irritated.  That might be some from your scratching.

PATIENT N655
Yeah it's just on the outside.

DOCTOR N655
Same sort of thing.

PATIENT N655
And down here some on my stomach and right in my back, right across halfway on the back.

DOCTOR N655
Take a look at the back here.

PATIENT N655
Huh?

DOCTOR N655
So I don't see anything that looks like it's.  Yeah sometimes, I'm sure it's itching.  I'm sure that's not the.

PATIENT N655
Well that's the reason I figure I've gotten the hydrocortisone as well as this other male something which is a liquid.

DOCTOR N655
Uh-huh.

PATIENT N655
I've tried all of them.  They are helpful but I want to get rid of it.  It keep getting a little worse, a little worse and I need a better.  Somebody that know more about it or give me a good ideas as to what's going on.

DOCTOR N655
Well I'll talk to DOCTOR and see if we can get this in line.

PATIENT N655
Did you see any rash?

DOCTOR N655
I didn't.

PATIENT N655
I try to scratch as less as possible.  Now that it don't bother me too much during the day.  In your opinion do you think a dermatologist would help?

DOCTOR N655
Well that's the question that we need to answer um.  They are really good with the skin and that's what they deal with day in and day out so they're good with skin conditions.

PATIENT N655
Yeah.

DOCTOR N655
Um and without a rash then it's kind of a toss-up and they might have enough information or they might say why did you send him here he doesn't have a rash.  That's kind of what the question we need to answer.  So if we think that they're gonna provide us some useful information then we could send you over there um.  Let's take a look at your legs quick.  Since you had swelling in the past.  I'll talk to DOCTOR and see what he thinks.  I know he's seen you in the past before.  Uh the swelling has been better than it had been?

PATIENT N655
No it's not too bad, it's tender there.

DOCTOR N655
Tender there yeah.  Um do you wear compression stockings at all?

PATIENT N655
Off and on.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
I put them on and sometime I have to get them off in a hurry as my legs start cramping.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
I feel more comfortable without them.  I sleep with a pillow under my feet trying to make the blood pressure better.  Then I get cramps at night and sometimes if I don't drink enough water I have to get up and get out of bed and get the circulation going.

DOCTOR N655
Yeah.

PATIENT N655
Then you got to course over the Northwestern Hospital for the cramps in the leg and I'm thinking on joining them over there for a while to see if they can find out what's creating the cramps.  I get on my knees, I only stand on my knees ten minutes and then up in my thigh it looks like the blood starts clouding up and everything is getting hard.

DOCTOR N655
Uh-huh.  Are you still taking aspirin?

PATIENT N655
I took an aspirin today.  I take one in the day and sometime I take one at night but.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
I take one a day anyway.

DOCTOR N655
Alright and do you get that from us or do you get that from somewhere else?

PATIENT N655
I get them somewhere else.

DOCTOR N655
Okay that's fine.  Um let's see.  Uh any problems urinating?

PATIENT N655
I didn't hear that.

DOCTOR N655
Any problems urinating?

PATIENT N655
No.  I take a good pill for that.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
It's called tamsulosin and that's very good.

DOCTOR N655
Alright that's fine.

PATIENT N655
It keeps me regulated.

DOCTOR N655
Have you gotten a pneumonia shot in the past?  The pneumonia shot?

PATIENT N655
Say what?

DOCTOR N655
Have you got a pneumonia vaccination in the past?

PATIENT N655
Oh yes.  That's been about six years ago.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  That's in @@@@ and that's been nine years.  Alright, I'll go talk to the boss okay.

PATIENT N655
Okay.

DOCTOR N655
And I'll be back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:40  DOCTOR IN:  41:27)

DOCTOR N655
Alright so I'll put in a couple of consults and he does think it's not gonna hurt to get you to see Dermatology so we're gonna put that in.  And you haven't ever seen them before is that correct?  You haven't ever seen them?

PATIENT N655
Huh?

DOCTOR N655
You haven't ever seen Dermatology?

PATIENT N655
No.  Can we tell them it's necessary for the doctor to come up with something that we use on the outside?

DOCTOR N655
Yeah hopefully we'll see what they say um and how long has the itching been going on again?

PATIENT N655
About a month and a half.  I used to take use some pills they called Benadryl that I used to take for allergies or something.

DOCTOR N655
Yeah they still do that but like we talked about it can sometimes cause you to be, so it makes you tired and a little bit loopy and once people get above about 65, which you're a little bit above that, we try not to give it cause it sometimes can make you too tired and makes you confused so we want to avoid that.  Looks like you're really with it here.

PATIENT N655
And if it solves the purpose I have @@@ of it.

DOCTOR N655
Uh it's kind of a risk and benefit.  I think we'll see if there's anything else we can do cause we'd rather have you a little bit itchy and alert than confused and not.

PATIENT N655
Uh what did DOCTOR say?

DOCTOR N655
He said we'll get you to see Dermatology and see if they give us anything, any information.

PATIENT N655
Yeah that's something would ease my mind.

DOCTOR N655
We'll have them schedule that out front.

PATIENT N655
Did he say anything about that heart examination I got?

DOCTOR N655
Yeah, so we actually looked at it and it looked like it was um, there's some atherosclerosis which is like the vessels being a little bit um, a little bit narrowed but there's nothing, like no like lesion there that's causing your problem.  There's no blockages.

PATIENT N655
Or did that correct the intermittent heartbeat?

DOCTOR N655
So that probably didn't correct it um.  Or did you have a procedure where they went in and like burned some of the heart tissue?

PATIENT N655
I don't know, you know he went up in there with a wire sort with something on the end, it was supposed to do its job but it was I'd have to read the full report again.

DOCTOR N655
And you just had that once is that right?

PATIENT N655
Yes, @@@.

DOCTOR N655
Okay so yeah what they did is they checked um, they checked the uh vessels of the heart to make sure that wasn't causing the problem and that wasn't it and so they just put you on the medications, one of the medications you're on is to control the heart rate and so that was the plan.  

PATIENT N655
So he said that @@@ wasn't in uh.

DOCTOR N655
So your heart rate's fine now which is what we really look at.  That's kind of how we follow it.  Okay.  So you've seen the ear doctors about your hearing aid right?

PATIENT N655
Yes I've seen, they tuned up my hearing aid.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
And told me that I'd have to get a confirmation or something to get my ears checked @@@ so that the hearing aids are the correct ones for my hearing.

DOCTOR N655
Okay so you're gonna go back to the Audiology Department?

PATIENT N655
Yes.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  We can set that up.  So what we'll do is, you can take this paper out front, they'll schedule the appointment for the hearing aid in a couple weeks, Dermatology hopefully within two weeks.  I'm not sure how long it takes to get in there.  It might be a little bit longer than that.

PATIENT N655
Alright.

DOCTOR N655
And then uh you'll come back here in about four months.  So it looks like, do you need any refills on your medications?

PATIENT N655
I don't know do I?

DOCTOR N655
Let's see.

PATIENT N655
Take a quick look, please.  He got a DOCTOR got very good hopes I'd be alive four months from now.

DOCTOR N655
Yep.  He does.  And you get your medications in the mail?

PATIENT N655
I'll pick it up.

DOCTOR N655
Oh you pick it up.

PATIENT N655
They send some in the mail; it's something they @@@.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  Alright it looks like you've got, looks like you've got enough medications so you should be set.

PATIENT N655
I have any refills on all of them?

DOCTOR N655
Yep you've got refills on everything.

PATIENT N655
Good, that's fine.  I hope I don't have to itch before I see Derm.

DOCTOR N655
Yeah you should be able to see them before it itch gets bad.

PATIENT N655
Wonder if the dermatologist possibly could tell me, if he has any ideas of what's going on I think, he should have.

DOCTOR N655
Hopefully yeah, hopefully.  See if they have any reminder for me before you go.  Sometimes they have some questions that they want us to ask you every once in a while.  

PATIENT N655
You're not giving me any type of medicine or anything I think.

DOCTOR N655
Nothing new.

PATIENT N655
Nothing new.

DOCTOR N655
Uh do you use tobacco?  Do you still smoke?  Have you ever smoked?

PATIENT N655
Yes.  Like a chimney.

DOCTOR N655
When did you quit?

PATIENT N655
Oh I quit about 24 years ago.

DOCTOR N655
Oh wow alright.  So about 1985, something like that.

PATIENT N655
Uh longer than that uh I quit smoking let's see after I was in my program for 7 years, I'm an alcoholic.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.

PATIENT N655
So I quit drinking in '75 and it was seven years from '75 when I quit smoking.

DOCTOR N655
Uh '84.

PATIENT N655
Alright.  So it's been quite some time.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  And um have you ever done something called an Advanced Directive?

PATIENT N655
Say that again.

DOCTOR N655
Have you ever done an Advanced Directive?  It basically is uh, you fill out a form that says what you'd want done in certain scenarios so.

PATIENT N655
You mean when you die?

DOCTOR N655
Well or before.  If something would happen where your health gets a little bit, gets worse.

PATIENT N655
I want them to do the best you can to keep me going.

DOCTOR N655
Okay.  Let's see.

PATIENT N655
I haven't lost faith in this world, even though it's cruel at times.

DOCTOR N655
Alright.  Alright sir that should do you.

PATIENT N655
Okay.

DOCTOR N655
Let us know if there's anything we can do for you in the meantime and they'll schedule those appointments out front.

PATIENT N655
All I do is take this out front?

DOCTOR N655
Yep, just show them at the front desk.

PATIENT N655
Okay thank you doctor.

DOCTOR N655
Alright sir, take care.
