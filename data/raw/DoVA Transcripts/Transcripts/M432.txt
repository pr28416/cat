Time of Encounter:  @@@ 

DOCTOR M432
PATIENT?

PATIENT M432
Yep.  

DOCTOR M432
Pleased to meet you.  I’m DOCTOR. Who is your primary, I'm filling in comments.

PATIENT M432
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR M432
What happened?

PATIENT M432
I needed to have an emergency @@@.

DOCTOR M432
Oh okay, so what brings you in today?

PATIENT M432
Well actually it's several things.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M432
The main one is my breathing pattern. I need some antibiotics and some prednisone @@@.

DOCTOR M432
Oh, okay.

PATIENT M432
The last several times @@@.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
But I also had some blood in my stool.

DOCTOR M432
Today?

PATIENT M432
Not today, Sunday.

DOCTOR M432
Okay how much blood is in it. 

PATIENT M432
Serious amounts, it's about the color of that switch right there where that help is.

DOCTOR M432
How many times have you had happen?

PATIENT M432
Just that one time.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
But it scared me to see it was all clotted up and bright red like that.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
And I knew I hadn't eaten anything that would cause that.

DOCTOR M432
Right.

PATIENT M432
Uh there's a possibility that you know a hemorrhoid popped or something.

DOCTOR M432
Yeah.

PATIENT M432
I guess that's a possibility that I would have thought.

DOCTOR M432
Did you have rectal pain?

PATIENT M432
No.

DOCTOR M432
No pain when you were wiping?

PATIENT M432
No, but there was blood.

DOCTOR M432
So did you see blood when you were wiping?

PATIENT M432
Right.

DOCTOR M432
Without even wiping?

PATIENT M432
Oh no, I looked in the bowl.  You know, I could tell something wasn't right because the stool was a little bit loose.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
And so I was looking down and oh my God, there was a lot of blood.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
And uh I'm gonna guess, if I were measuring it probably a quarter cup of.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
Of serious uh blood.  Now I also noticed that here lately my urine has been darkening up quite a bit.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M432
Which in the olden days that would have been indicating my rheumatic fever was acting up uh; however, I don't think I that's the case any more.  There's a real heavy odor to it.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M432
Uh, I'm concerned.  I tell you what, I take a product called @@@ uh Humira. 

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M432
For RA and I know that it masks the symptoms of cancer.

DOCTOR M432
Hmm.

PATIENT M432
And that's my main concern, to be honest with you.

DOCTOR M432
Is that, do you have bladder cancer?

PATIENT M432
Well I don't know it could be liver, it could be kidney or anything.  It could be a lot of different kinds.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.  Okay.

PATIENT M432
Uh could I have rectal cancer?  Is that a possibility?  That’s what my dad passed away from.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M432
So uh, so I'm more than a little concerned about the blood so.

DOCTOR M432
Right.

PATIENT M432
And I'm hoping that you send me downstairs and get a series of tests done.

DOCTOR M432
Yeah the only problem is, well let's see.  Just to have things come back faster.

PATIENT M432
Uh-huh, well you don't have to do it faster.

DOCTOR M432
You may...  How's your breathing?

PATIENT M432
My breathing right now is uh; let me put it this way, its worse if I lay down.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M432
I've got mucous so I need a mucolytic of some sort.

DOCTOR M432
You're coughing up a lot? @@@

PATIENT M432
In the morning I cough up a hairball, I mean a really hard knot of snot.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.  Does it feel like your COPD?

PATIENT M432
I'm sure that the COPD is uh being uh fed by the uh drainage.  You know I'm sure that it's causing the COPD to react.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.  Postnasal drainage?

PATIENT M432
Yeah.

DOCTOR M432
Okay when did all of this start?

PATIENT M432
Oh God it's been going on for awhile if you look in your notes, you’ll see the last couple times I've been in.

DOCTOR M432
I mean is @@@ coming and going?

PATIENT M432
Well actually it never seems to go away.  It lightens up a while when I'm taking the antibiotics and the prednisone.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M432
And almost two, three, days later I'm right back where I was.  They’ve done this a number of times now so I don't, they're pretty sure it's an exacerbation of COPD, probably being caused by the postnasal drainage and the fact that, you know when the stuff blocks your throat, it makes it a little harder to get a breath in to begin with and then you start you know @@@.

DOCTOR M432
So when were your last @@@ 

PATIENT M432
Well about four weeks ago.  No two weeks ago cause I was in Florida when I took the next dose.

DOCTOR M432
Okay and when are you going to see DOCTOR again?

PATIENT M432
I think that's the end of next week.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
I could be wrong but you can check that.  I think possibly next Thursday I see him.

DOCTOR M432
Um have you been treated off and on with prednisone and antibiotics.

PATIENT M432
Yeah.

DOCTOR M432
For a year?

PATIENT M432
Probably even longer than that.

DOCTOR M432
Off and on?

PATIENT M432
Off and on.  Since I came back from Arizona two years ago I've felt, at first they saw stuff in my lungs and x-rays and CAT scans that they couldn't figure out and uh they thought that maybe you know there was a possibility I had some kind of a disease or a fungal disease cause I'd been out in the southwest.  

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M432
It turned out that wasn't the case.  They tested for I can't tell you how many different types of things and they know I've got COPD.  They know that I have some kind of issue that's causing the drainage so.  And eventually @@@ breathing problems.

DOCTOR M432
Do you feel like your breathing is more labored?

PATIENT M432
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR M432
Are you wheezing more or?

PATIENT M432
Well actually I do wheeze but then it's more labored breathing.  It's hard really to know to say which one was worse; it's the fact that it's hard to get a breath.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M432
Or sometimes @@@.

DOCTOR M432
Do you have a neb machine at home?

PATIENT M432
Yes I do and it's actually in my car.  I have a converter in my car.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.  Have you given yourself a breathing treatment today?

PATIENT M432
Uh I may have taken about three.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
One on the way here and two before I left @@@.  

DOCTOR M432
And you're coughing up more sputum.  What color is it?

PATIENT M432
Green.  The infection is pretty rampant at this point.

DOCTOR M432
Fevers, chills?  You've had a fever today?

PATIENT M432
I got a fever right now.  Uh I was at 98 something she said.

DOCTOR M432
98.9 

PATIENT M432
I'm normally at 97.6, 97.4.

DOCTOR M432
Have you felt warm at home?

PATIENT M432
Yeah, I'll actually take off my top start dripping wet.  So if I have a cold or something to go along with all those issues, that's a problem too.  I don’t want to take any cold medicine at this point in time.

DOCTOR M432
Any chills?

PATIENT M432
Well, actually what happens is you take your shirt off cause you're just soaking wet and oh I try to dry off as best I can.

DOCTOR M432
Yeah.

PATIENT M432
But then yeah eventually I start being like chill blanes.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.  So kind of warm and chilled for how long now?

PATIENT M432
That's been going on for at least a week.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.  Have you been tested for tuberculosis?

PATIENT M432
Yes.

DOCTOR M432
Okay when did you have that?

PATIENT M432
About 500 times.  Well the first time has been about ten years or eight years ago when they started me on Humira but as I told you, two years ago or three years ago when I went off to Arizona and when I came back, that was one of the top things on the list that they were worried about so they went ahead and gave me the scratch test and uh I think theyI've done it two or three times subsequently.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
Just in case.  And that’s great, I love the fact taht prevention is a couple of things here but do I think that's the problem no, uh probably not.  Now I'll be happy to take a stress test if you want it but my concern is possible cancer and uh I mean I could probably get by until next week and see DOCTOR to get the prednisone and the antibiotics.

DOCTOR M432
When was your last chest x-ray?  October.

PATIENT M432
Uh.

DOCTOR M432
You had a CT in April.

PATIENT M432
Yep.

DOCTOR M432
You had a chest x-ray before then.

PATIENT M432
Yeah I think I've got another CT coming up next Thursday.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.  Uh you're kinda right in the middle where you look fine but some of your symptoms are concerning and you need the breathing treatments @@@ and of course you have fevers.

PATIENT M432
Yeah.

DOCTOR M432
Uh I want to talk with my attending about you going home with the treatment that you had before or maybe going to the Emergency Room so that you can have a chest x-ray and get it read, you get your antibiotics, you get a treatment@@@, we get everything that you need @@@ you know.  Uh we'll see let me talk to my attending.

PATIENT M432
Okay.  Whatever.

DOCTOR M432
And then the blood in the stool, so that happened how many times?

PATIENT M432
It's happened more than once but this one was scary because of the amount.

DOCTOR M432
So how long has that been going on?

PATIENT M432
Wasn't the same.

DOCTOR M432
The blood in the stool?

PATIENT M432
Uh probably several months but that's, you know I attributed it probably to the hemorrhoids it was never in this large of amount.  You know I would go back and wipe and you know there's a little blood or something like that it's uh.

DOCTOR M432
When was your last colonoscopy?

PATIENT M432
Uh I want to say two years, three years ago.

DOCTOR M432
Was that here?

PATIENT M432
Yeah.  Yeah I've had a couple of them actually.

DOCTOR M432
@@@.

PATIENT M432
@@@

DOCTOR M432
I don't see where it was done.

PATIENT M432
Pardon?

DOCTOR M432
I don't see that it was done.

PATIENT M432
You don't see that it was done.

DOCTOR M432
I see that they put the consult in for it.

PATIENT M432
Oh no, I've had two of them.

DOCTOR M432
@@@.  

PATIENT M432
Yeah I've the results were all negative.

DOCTOR M432
Okay did you feel dizzy or like you were going to pass out?

PATIENT M432
When they did it?

DOCTOR M432
When you had the blood in your stool on Sunday?

PATIENT M432
Actually yeah I did feel a little bit lightheaded.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.  Did you… diverticulosis. That’s all. Diverticulosis, little pockets, but they didn’t say they’re hemorrhoids. How did you find out about hemorrhoids?

PATIENT M432
Well uh I guess time or another, @@@ normally prostate @@@ mentioned.  Not that they were serious or anything.

DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.  Okay.

PATIENT M432
Usually once a year somebody's does a prostate exam you know they were problem inflamed one time.

DOCTOR M432
Well how often were you having this blood in your stool before?

PATIENT M432
It's not like it was that often and it certainly was never that red.

DOCTOR M432
Every other month?  Every day or every week?

PATIENT M432
Oh no, no.

DOCTOR M432
Every week?

PATIENT M432
No nothing like that and when I could see it I'd put Prep H on that and you know pretty much.

DOCTOR M432
Are you constipated?  Do you strain for a bowel movement?

PATIENT M432
No.

DOCTOR M432
So how often was it happening?

PATIENT M432
You know it was infrequent let's put it that way.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
Did it happen with any regularity, no.  Uh did it occur, in a large amount like this before, no.  Usually it's just a trace amount.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
And uh like I said in this case it was totally loose stool so then you've got no straining, no cause for a rupture of a hemorrhoid.

DOCTOR M432
And the blood was mixed with the stool?

PATIENT M432
Yes.

DOCTOR M432
Did you pass out?

PATIENT M432
No.

DOCTOR M432

PATIENT M432

DOCTOR M432

DOCTOR M432

PATIENT M432

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432

DOCTOR M432
Any pain or burning when you urinate?

PATIENT M432

DOCTOR M432
No blood that you can see in the urine?

PATIENT M432
What's that?

DOCTOR M432
Can you see blood in the urine?

PATIENT M432
You know it could be blood that's causing it to darken @@@.

DOCTOR M432
Have you seen blood?

PATIENT M432
Specifically, no.

DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
But I mean I know that if blood mixes with urine that it darkens it.

DOCTOR M432
Right.

PATIENT M432
Now that could be the cause, it's possible and like I say it's got that real sulfurous @@@ like the whoosh of those matches. (Laughs)

PATIENT M432
I think the pink one starts with an A.

DOCTOR M432
Deep breath.  Breath out, deep breath in and out.  Deep breath in and out.  Okay.  You can breathe normally.  Can you lie back?  @@@.

I've got a breathing treatment down in the car so there's no real need for that.  I mean there's nothing that they can give me that I don't already have.

DOCTOR M432
Yeah they can give you IV steroids.  You can't give yourself that.

PATIENT M432
Nope.  That's true but I don't think we need to do that do we?

DOCTOR M432
We may need to.

(DOCTOR OUT:  152:00  DOCTOR IN:  158:20)

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Hi PATIENT, how are you?

PATIENT M432
How you doing?

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Not too bad, yourself?

PATIENT M432
Not bad.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
So uh DOCTOR was just telling me what's going on here.  You're coughing more and uh you know.  Let me just listen to your lungs here.  Can you take a deep breath, out, again.  Okay and you're also having um bloody stools?  Okay.  So you know it's fairly complex history and there is some wheezing in your lungs.

PATIENT M432
That's been going on for a while though, they know about that.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Yeah, yeah, no I mean most of your wheezing that’s not a big issue but you’re coughing and you're producing, you need a chest x-ray and things like that alright.

PATIENT M432
I have no problem with that.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
And the stool we need to follow up at the Emergency Room.

PATIENT M432
@@@ get it here.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
We can't do it out of here in this clinic.  You need to go to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT M432
Oh, you can't give me, have me go downstairs?

SECOND DOCTOR M432
No you need to go to the Emergency Room to follow up with that okay.  Because it's going to take hours for a routine test to be read by the radiologist, the radiologist has to read it, we can't read the films.  So the only facility here after hours is the Emergency Room.

PATIENT M432
Okay, I never want to go there so.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Yeah.

PATIENT M432
That's why I came here to begin with.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
No I know.

PATIENT M432
If I wanted to go straight there I'd of done that and I.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Yeah.

PATIENT M432
I don't feel like sitting around for ten hours.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
But you know you have uh.

PATIENT M432
I've got a machine in the car.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Blood in your stool and things like that, they're going to need to check your.

PATIENT M432
Well that's why I came here.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Yeah.

PATIENT M432
You guys would write a thing, I'd go downstairs to the Lab and they'd run whatever tests you need.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Yeah we can do that but we need to follow up with that.  If there's been emergency stuff then.  How long have you been having bloody stools @@@?

PATIENT M432
Well like I told her one time.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
On Sunday.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M432
Sunday I had blood and like I was telling her a quarter cup probably a quarter cup @@@ dark @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Do you have hemorrhoids?

PATIENT M432
I've been told I had some but she couldn't see any so.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
He's had a colonoscopy before @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Okay what we can do is just the original plan, the Z-Pak, uh blood work.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Blood work.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
The steroids and then you can follow up with your pulmonologist.

PATIENT M432
I'll see him next Thursday anyway.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
And after that we'll see if his medications need to be changed.  I don't think we need to @@@ the medications.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
No.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Just the steroid, Z-Pak and then the blood work.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
CBC And a chest x-ray.

PATIENT M432
Can they get a mucolytic to cut down on the amount of the secretions?

SECOND DOCTOR M432
No, the antibiotics should help with that okay.

PATIENT M432
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
We don't want that @@@

PATIENT M432
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
Okay.  Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Okay, take care.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
I'll put that in for your blood work at the Lab and your antibiotics and steroids.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Yeah if you get worse you need to come to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT M432
I will.  Thank you.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
No problem.

PATIENT M432
You've been @@@.  Now what about a urine test for fecal matter?

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Yeah she can order all that.  @@@.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
@@@.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
So that's the thing, I mean you probably should have been evaluated in the Emergency Room.  They can follow up with all of these things but.

PATIENT M432
But you can do the tests here I mean.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
Not after hours we can’t.

PATIENT M432
Oh I see what you're saying.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
It's going to take and it's going to delay, overnight.

PATIENT M432
Well I'm not going to die in the next 24 hours.  If something gets worse @@@.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
That's what I'm talking about, overnight if something happens you need to come to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT M432
Right.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Okay.

PATIENT M432
That's fine.

FIRST DOCTOR M432
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Thanks DOCTOR.

PATIENT M432
Thank you doc.

SECOND DOCTOR M432
Thank you take care.
