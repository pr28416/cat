DOCTOR P230
PATIENT?

PATIENT P230
How are you doctor?

DOCTOR P230
Good, how are you sir?

PATIENT P230
Fine.  It's been a while since I've been here.

DOCTOR P230
It's been a while, sorry to keep you waiting.

PATIENT P230
Well I had to cancel twice before so I'm kind of running out of prescriptions.

DOCTOR P230
Oh sure.  No problem.

PATIENT P230
I made it a point to make it for this one.

DOCTOR P230
Well thanks and I'm sorry but we had some add-ons today.  One of the other doctors had to cancel their clinic so it backed me up just a little bit.

PATIENT P230
Okay.

DOCTOR P230
Let me get your chart over here.

PATIENT P230
Okay.

DOCTOR P230
How have you been?

PATIENT P230
I've been fine so far.

DOCTOR P230
Good.

PATIENT P230
So far so good.  Putting a lot of hours as a bank guard.  Averaging anywhere from 55-60 hours a week so.

DOCTOR P230
Wow, that's a lot.

PATIENT P230
A lot of standing.  Yeah.

DOCTOR P230
But it's nice to have a job.

PATIENT P230
That's true.

DOCTOR P230
Um cause you uh, that's a lot of work for a retired.

PATIENT P230
Yeah well twice I did retire.

DOCTOR P230
Yeah.

PATIENT P230
But I went back to work.  I got tired of sitting around.  Only so much painting and fishing you could do.

DOCTOR P230
Well you probably, you know people that have things to do live longer.

PATIENT P230
That's true.  If you're going to be a couch potato you're going to be dead in a year.  You got to keep moving.

DOCTOR P230
Alright.  So I saw you last February is that right?

PATIENT P230
Correct.

DOCTOR P230
Alright and let's see what we did for you then.

PATIENT P230

DOCTOR P230
Good.  And you had your eyes checked?

PATIENT P230
Yep.  @@@.

DOCTOR P230

PATIENT P230
I'm pushing the big 78 come September.

DOCTOR P230
Good deal.  When did you have your bypass, how old were you?

PATIENT P230
Uh 98, I was in my 60s I believe, 65.

DOCTOR P230
Did you have a heart attack?

PATIENT P230
Nope.  Never had a heart attack.

DOCTOR P230
Good.

PATIENT P230
No stroke that I'm aware of.

DOCTOR P230
Right you just told me that.

PATIENT P230
Yeah.

DOCTOR P230
Alright and your blood pressure is a little high today it looks like.

PATIENT P230
Yes.  Uh I have a monitor at home and I've been getting, like I said anywhere between 160 and 180.  Uh sometimes it'll drop down to 150/60, you know so it depends.

DOCTOR P230
Hmm.  And we have you taking four medications?

PATIENT P230
Yes.  I've got them all listed here, simvastatin, @@@, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol and losartan.

DOCTOR P230
Losartan yeah.

PATIENT P230
Uh the one that I don't need and I got plenty of is gemfibrozil.

DOCTOR P230
Gemfibrozil?

PATIENT P230
Yeah.  I got two of them but right now I'm low on simvastatin @@@.

DOCTOR P230
Okay.

PATIENT P230
But we can order them I guess through the.

DOCTOR P230
You want them through the mail?

PATIENT P230
Yeah you can go through the mail or either I can pick them up tonight if you want.

DOCTOR P230
Whatever you want.

PATIENT P230
Well I'll pick them up tonight if they have them ready.  How long will it take them, about an hour?

DOCTOR P230
I don't know, it depends on how many people are down there.  Whatever is most convenient for you.

PATIENT P230
Well I have nothing to do so I can sit down there and wait I guess.  But since I met with you, my son one went down to @@@ in March my son had a slight heart attack.

DOCTOR P230
Oh I'm sorry to hear that.

PATIENT P230
They did a bypass and what do you call those stents, put two stents in.

DOCTOR P230
That's good.

PATIENT P230
Two stents, yeah he's doing fine now.

DOCTOR P230
Oh that's good.

PATIENT P230
But he's on the same blood pressure medication and the whole bit.

DOCTOR P230
How old is he?

PATIENT P230
The youngest son is 50.

DOCTOR P230
That's early to have a heart attack.

PATIENT P230
Right.  Right, it runs in the family yeah.

DOCTOR P230
Yeah, yeah.  Alright let's see what we got for you.

PATIENT P230
See my brother had one; of course he's passed away now what six years, seven years.  

DOCTOR P230
So your cholesterol looks good.

PATIENT P230
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P230
Um.

PATIENT P230
What's the cholesterol reading?

DOCTOR P230
Well that was a year ago so I may need to repeat that soon.  I don't think we need to today.  Um you've probably eaten, you've eaten today?

PATIENT P230
Yeah well I cheated today, I had a hot dog and uh tamale, which I shouldn't have, I know.

DOCTOR P230
What I'll do is I'm going to order a fasting cholesterol test for you.  You can come back anytime to do it, there's no rush okay.  Your cholesterol looks great.

PATIENT P230
Okay.

DOCTOR P230
Um and when you do come back and get the other lab I'm going to order as well.  

PATIENT P230
Okay.

DOCTOR P230
This just checks on your kidney functions.

PATIENT P230
Oh okay.

DOCTOR P230
Which we need to keep an eye on because of your blood pressure.

PATIENT P230
Right.

DOCTOR P230
Well I'll have you sit over there.

PATIENT P230
Alright.

DOCTOR P230
Okay.  Check your blood pressure there.

PATIENT P230
Okay, what's with the.

DOCTOR P230
We'll try it.

PATIENT P230
Alright.

DOCTOR P230
We'll try it.

PATIENT P230
She did the last time.

DOCTOR P230
We'll be consistent then.

PATIENT P230
Yeah.

DOCTOR P230
Are you a Bears fan?

PATIENT P230
Not really.

DOCTOR P230
Yeah.

PATIENT P230
But if they make it past this one then they deserve it.

DOCTOR P230
There you go.  If they can beat Seattle right?

PATIENT P230
Right.  I've been betting against them all year.  At the time I bet with them they lost.

DOCTOR P230
That's right.  Lift up on the elbow a little bit.

PATIENT P230
Okay.

DOCTOR P230
There you go.  If you're flexed it'll make it seem higher.

PATIENT P230
Yeah.

DOCTOR P230
Okay that's better.  It says 130.

PATIENT P230
130 yeah it came down quite a bit.

DOCTOR P230
Yeah.

PATIENT P230
Yeah.

DOCTOR P230
But at home though, at home it's 150s you said?

PATIENT P230
Well I usually take it at night and I shouldn't do that, I should take it earlier in the day but I'm working during the day and these hours are something like 10 1/2 hours at the bank.

DOCTOR P230
That's a lot.

PATIENT P230
Right and by the time I get home, that's the only time I can take it is at night.

DOCTOR P230
Yeah it's probably not the best time to read it.

PATIENT P230
Right and it's at night so.

DOCTOR P230
What time do you get up in the morning?

PATIENT P230
I get up at 5 in the morning.

DOCTOR P230
What time do you go to work?

PATIENT P230
I'll be there before 8.

DOCTOR P230
Could you take it before you leave for work?

PATIENT P230
I could take that in the morning yeah sure.

DOCTOR P230
I wouldn't do it the first time.

PATIENT P230
No I wouldn't either because you got to get the blood circulating.

DOCTOR P230
So do you have breakfast?

PATIENT P230
Well I have a banana usually, I don't eat too much for breakfast.

DOCTOR P230
Okay, so get up, have your banana and coffee, whatever.  Do you take coffee?

PATIENT P230
Yeah.

DOCTOR P230
Caffeine?

PATIENT P230
Uh yeah regular coffee black.

DOCTOR P230
How early do you have that after getting up?  First thing or?

PATIENT P230
Oh maybe about 5:10, maybe 5:15, we got the timer on the coffee pot so if it's not on I'll turn it on.  @@@.

DOCTOR P230
So why don't you get up in the morning um.

PATIENT P230
Yeah.

DOCTOR P230
Wash your face or whatever you do and then uh take your blood pressure and then have your coffee.

PATIENT P230
Alright, sounds good.

DOCTOR P230
Hang tight for me; um I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT P230
Alright.  I won't have to take a number down there for the prescriptions will I?

DOCTOR P230
I don't think so.

PATIENT P230
@@@.

DOCTOR P230
I've already put the order in and I will send them down there.

PATIENT P230
Alright.

DOCTOR P230
Um and when was your last colonoscopy?  Do you know?

PATIENT P230
Hmm maybe three years ago.

DOCTOR P230
Here?

PATIENT P230
No, I got it at a doctor's office.  They had a doctor and I can't remember his name now.

DOCTOR P230
Do you smoke?

PATIENT P230
No I quit in '94.  '84, I'm sorry.

DOCTOR P230
What about alcohol, do you use alcohol?

PATIENT P230
I have a drink maybe occasionally once a week, a beer or maybe a highball or something.

DOCTOR P230
Uh-huh.

PATIENT P230
But nothing daily.

DOCTOR P230
Uh-huh.  Okay.  And then let's see, did they do the neck exam?  It's ENT.

PATIENT P230
Uh they did it here I believe.

DOCTOR P230
Let's see here.  Yeah.

PATIENT P230
They said something about it was going the other way cause I had one of the arteries was done on the right side and I think it's working good I guess.  The other side I guess is blocked.

DOCTOR P230
And you saw the Peripheral Vascular surgeons?

PATIENT P230
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P230
And they wanted to see you in one year, do you have an appointment with them, let's see.  Hmmm  You're just supposed to follow up with the vascular surgeon within the next couple months.

PATIENT P230
Okay.

DOCTOR P230
Okay.

PATIENT P230
That's that uh sound test again?

DOCTOR P230
Yeah I think they're going to check to make sure they don't need to do anything because it was.

PATIENT P230
They said there was nothing they could do.

DOCTOR P230
Huh.

PATIENT P230
That's what he told me the last time, so that's why I didn't.  I figured well it was working on one side, it's good enough.  When I that shuts down it's through.

DOCTOR P230
Okay.  

PATIENT P230
But he said he got a good sound on my right side so.

DOCTOR P230
Good deal.  Almost done, I just got to look up.

PATIENT P230
