DOCTOR G161
Okay.  Um so you said your sugars has been averaging about 125, 130?

PATIENT G161
Yeah.

DOCTOR G161
We'll say the last three, four weeks, what's the highest it's been?

PATIENT G161
Something like 160.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  That's I mean, you know that's high but that's not.

PATIENT G161
150.

DOCTOR G161
I've heard a lot worse than that today.

PATIENT G161
165.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.

PATIENT G161
I haven't uh; I took my medicine this morning.

DOCTOR G161
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G161
And I haven't eaten just in case you want to test.

DOCTOR G161
Good, yeah well that will help a lot.  Do you remember, I know it's hard to say, over the summer when they drew your blood were you fasting at that time or had you had something to eat then?

PATIENT G161
I probably had something to eat because the doctor you know he got kind of upset at me because I ate.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  Cause yeah your numbers were.

PATIENT G161
Cause that's why I didn't eat this time.

DOCTOR G161
Good, great.

PATIENT G161
And I need something quick, too.

DOCTOR G161
What's the lowest your readings have been?

PATIENT G161
Uh the lowest that I've seen was when um.

DOCTOR G161
In the last three weeks let's say?

PATIENT G161
Oh the last three weeks.

DOCTOR G161
Yeah.

PATIENT G161
I had 110.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.

PATIENT G161
That's when I start shaking and stuff.

DOCTOR G161
So even at 110 you feel a little weak.

PATIENT G161
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  Okay.  So do you usually take some juice or something like that to get better pretty quick?

PATIENT G161
Yes.  I take a little juice or you know I keep a lot of hard candy just in case you know.

DOCTOR G161
Well that's good.

PATIENT G161
Yeah I uh get me some juice or something with sugar in it.

DOCTOR G161
Alright.  Um as far as your gout, when was the last time you had a flare-up of your gout?

PATIENT G161
Oh it's been many years.  I would say it's been three, four or five years.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.

PATIENT G161
But they @@@.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  You just couldn't ever be a sandal model huh?

PATIENT G161
No, not too much no.  Um there is one thing I need you to look up.

DOCTOR G161
Yeah.

PATIENT G161
I think there's some swelling in this leg.

DOCTOR G161
Okay @@@.

PATIENT G161
Okay.  It's really swollen there.

DOCTOR G161
How long has this been going on?

PATIENT G161
About two or three weeks.

DOCTOR G161
How did you get this scar here?

PATIENT G161
Oh well no that was a long time ago when I was walking, I was walking through like a hallway, I was supposed to step up, I didn't step up and I hit it so yeah.

DOCTOR G161
@@@.

PATIENT G161
Yeah and doctor and this has happened for a long time and I came to the doctor about a year ago.  See how that one's bigger than that one?

DOCTOR G161
Yeah.

PATIENT G161
I came to the doctor about a year ago; I came here about a year ago.

DOCTOR G161
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G161
Cause I was concerned about pain in my legs in here and here you know when I walk and so they sent me upstairs to take a test and everything so they didn't see anything wrong but if I walk for a period of time, like two or three blocks, I get pain in my legs here and here and it still happens.  And uh so I was watching television.

DOCTOR G161
Yeah.

PATIENT G161
Two or three weeks ago.  I was watching television two or three weeks ago and I saw a commercial about Plavix it was talking about because it could be uh something called periphery artery disease.

DOCTOR G161
Yeah.  I mean so but you walk, you go two, three blocks, it starts hurting, if you stop it gets better?

PATIENT G161
Right and it does get better, if I stop and rest its fine then I walk a little while longer.

DOCTOR G161
When was it that you had that test done?

PATIENT G161
I'm gonna say roughly a year ago.

DOCTOR G161
And what did they do, do you remember?

PATIENT G161
Uh they took me up there and put me on the table and then they hooked all these things on my legs.  Well what did they do?

DOCTOR G161
You know let me, give me just a second I'll look right here and see what I can find.

PATIENT G161
Yeah.

DOCTOR G161
You can put @@@.

PATIENT G161
Okay thank you doctor.

DOCTOR G161
Yeah that left nail do you think that's infected or you just?

PATIENT G161
No it's been like that ever since I was a baby.

DOCTOR G161
It's been dark that long?

PATIENT G161
It's been like that forever.

DOCTOR G161
Alright then I won't bother that.

PATIENT G161
Yeah it is.  It's been like that since I was a little boy.  You don't see anything?

DOCTOR G161
Was that before or after you were in the hospital for pneumonia?

PATIENT G161
It was before.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.

PATIENT G161
It was before I was in the hospital for pneumonia.  They said there was nothing wrong with it but you know the pain still persists so the doctor told me, what the doctor told me to do was just walk as much as you can and then it'll go away.

DOCTOR G161
And is it one leg more than the other?

PATIENT G161
No actually it's both of them.

DOCTOR G161
Cause it wasn't completely normal.

PATIENT G161
No.

DOCTOR G161
No and I'm sorry if somebody told you that but.

PATIENT G161
But why didn't they do anything about it?

DOCTOR G161
Um I mean really at first the best thing to do is to try and get your blood pressure and your diabetes under control.  Those are the two best things you can do for it but if you're going two or three blocks now and you're a young man, I mean that's something we need to.

PATIENT G161
Right, right.

DOCTOR G161
If you don't mind I would go ahead and repeat that test.

PATIENT G161
You don't want to repeat it?

DOCTOR G161
No I would.

PATIENT G161
Oh okay.

DOCTOR G161
I would want to repeat that test and depending on what that shows I might have to have you talk with the vascular surgeons, the doctors that deal with the blood vessels.  Sometimes if there's, you know just like people can get a narrowing of the blood vessel in their heart, you can get a narrowing of the blood vessel that goes to your leg.

PATIENT G161
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G161
Sometimes it's just as simple as them using a little balloon or a stent to open up the blood vessel and that'll make a big difference for you.

PATIENT G161
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G161
Um what kind of work do you do?

PATIENT G161
I work at a shipping and receiving department on the dock at the University of Chicago.

DOCTOR G161
Okay, alright.  So you're on your feet a lot so you're maybe not walking that far right?

PATIENT G161
I'm on my feet quite a bit.  

DOCTOR G161
Yeah.

PATIENT G161
I'm on my feet out of eight hours I may be on my feet around six of them.  I'm not doing a lot of long walking but you know how a college campus is, you gonna have to walk.

DOCTOR G161
Yeah, @@@ yeah.

PATIENT G161
Yeah okay so like I may be putting some boxes on the cart to deliver to another building two or three blocks away.

DOCTOR G161
Yeah.

PATIENT G161
And I will take it for a walk.

DOCTOR G161
Alright, yeah we definitely need to deal with this.

PATIENT G161
And so you know @@@ and you know you could probably look to see if the doctors that I talked to, about he told me you know you just keep walking and you know it'll go away.  You know I him I'll walk as much as I can but sometimes I take the stairs.

DOCTOR G161
And that I mean walking does generally help it actually.  Um it may seem counter intuitive to do something that causes pain but it does, you know little by little help but I mean it sounds like it’s something you already do.  I mean you're not a person who sits on the couch all day every day.

PATIENT G161
No.

DOCTOR G161
So and that’s obvious.  Um so we definitely need to do that.  The other thing we need to do now that you're 50 years old is get a colonoscopy.

PATIENT G161
Okay.

DOCTOR G161
Have you ever had one of those?

PATIENT G161
I don't think so.  If I had one it was a very, very long time ago.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  So what that is um, sorry if you already know but basically uh it's to look for any kind of polyps.

PATIENT G161
No, I haven’t had one of those.

DOCTOR G161
Okay and the reason we do it is it's like a screening for cancer um.  Everybody that turns 50 gets it, male or female um.

PATIENT G161
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR G161
Uh and the thought is that these little polyps they start out as simple things but they can turn into cancer if they're in there for a long time.

PATIENT G161
Hmm.

DOCTOR G161
They try to catch them early, remove them and they never turn into cancer.

PATIENT G161
Okay do it then.

DOCTOR G161
So we'll set you up for that.  Any diseases that run in your family?

PATIENT G161
Um heart disease runs in you know on my father's side of the family.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  What age, when did it start affecting people on his side of the family?

PATIENT G161
It started to affect him when he was; I think he was in his early 50s when he had about a double bypass, heart problems.  

DOCTOR G161
Was he diabetic?

PATIENT G161
No.

DOCTOR G161
No alright.

PATIENT G161
I'm the only one in my family with diabetes.

DOCTOR G161
You're the lucky one huh?

PATIENT G161
I must be.

DOCTOR G161
Alright um, so we'll set you up for the colonoscopy.  Do you take an aspirin every day?

PATIENT G161
I used to but I don't.  The reason why I don't is because uh you know DOCTOR used to prescribe it to me and when he stopped prescribing it, I thought I didn't need it anymore so I stopped taking it.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  I'm going to recommend you start taking a baby aspirin again every day, 81 mg.

PATIENT G161
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G161
Um I'm happy to prescribe it for you here but if I prescribed it for you here they're gonna charge you $8 a bottle.

PATIENT G161
Okay.

DOCTOR G161
You can buy it at Walgreens, it’s two dollars.

PATIENT G161
Okay yeah, yeah, I'll pick up two of them.  I got to get 81 mg?

DOCTOR G161
Yeah, it'll say like baby aspirin on there.  It's a standard dose but you don't need the full dose.  You don't need the 325 mg.  Those are the two strengths.  You need the lower strength.

PATIENT G161
81 mg.

DOCTOR G161
That's right.

PATIENT G161
Okay I'll remember that, I'll go buy it.

DOCTOR G161
Alright.  I want to listen to your heart and your lungs here real quick.  Take a deep breath.  Do you ever get any belly pain?

PATIENT G161
No, but I'm hungry.

DOCTOR G161
That's normal.  So you're hungry right now.

PATIENT G161
Uh yes, I’m starving.

DOCTOR G161
Um do you smoke?

PATIENT G161
Unfortunately I do.  I quit but then when I quit drinking I started back smoking again.  It was kind of hard to do both of them at the same time, got to something that's wrong you know.  So I'm going to quit them again.

DOCTOR G161
How much are you smoking right now?

PATIENT G161
Approximately a pack a day.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  How long have you been smoking?

PATIENT G161
Well um, I'm 50 years old I been smoking since I was about 15.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  Um and before you stopped drinking how much were you smoking or how much were you drinking?

PATIENT G161
I was drinking about a pint of maybe whiskey a week.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.

PATIENT G161
And maybe two six-packs of beer a week.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  Um well did the drinking become a problem for you or why did you quit?

PATIENT G161
Uh for health reasons sir.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.

PATIENT G161
Uh with the diabetes.

DOCTOR G161
Yeah.

PATIENT G161
All that and it's not good for you @@@.

DOCTOR G161
Um, absolutely, anything else I mean cocaine, marijuana, heroin?

PATIENT G161
No, no.

DOCTOR G161
Okay.  Alright well let me go talk with the doctor I'm working with but we'll refill these meds for you so you can pick them up here today.

PATIENT G161
Okay.

DOCTOR G161
I'll put in for the blood work so you can get that done and get some lunch and then um.

PATIENT G161
You mean get the blood work done today?

DOCTOR G161
Yeah, yeah cause you said you hadn't eaten anything right?

PATIENT G161
Right, right.

DOCTOR G161
So yeah and the best thing to do is actually check in at the Pharmacy, go get the blood work and when you're done with the blood work they should be close to done with your plls.

PATIENT G161
Then I have to come back and see you?

DOCTOR G161
Uh no.  I will um, I will probably have you come back with the pharmacist in a few weeks to go over the lab results and see if you need to change anything for your diabetes medicines.

PATIENT G161
Alright and also uh, you're going to book me for that test that you said.

DOCTOR G161
I'm going to send you for a repeat of that test as well as for the colonoscopy.

PATIENT G161
Not today though.

DOCTOR G161
I'll put in the order today but the test wouldn't be done today.

PATIENT G161
That's what I was asking.

DOCTOR G161
Yeah, no they'll call you to arrange that.

PATIENT G161
Okay.

DOCTOR G161
Alright.

PATIENT G161
Alright.

DOCTOR G161
Give me just a minute; let me talk with the doctor I'm working with alright.
