PATIENT J087
And I can pick them up today uh.  Yeah that way in about three months I can make another round.

DOCTOR J087
Yeah, that works for you? Okay, yeah let's do that.  Um let me just check a couple things I need to do.  So last time we checked your cholesterol was recently, no it was about a year ago.  I'm gonna order labs for you.  You do not have to get them done today.

PATIENT J087
Well I might as well get it cause I.

DOCTOR J087
Cause you're here you'll get them.

PATIENT J087
I haven't eaten nothing.

DOCTOR J087
You haven't eaten?

PATIENT J087
Since 3 o'clock yesterday in the afternoon.

DOCTOR J087
Why not?

PATIENT J087
I'm getting ready for @@@.

DOCTOR J087
@@@ smart.

PATIENT J087
Maybe you wanted to uh.

DOCTOR J087
Alright I.

PATIENT J087
Blood tests.

DOCTOR J087
Yes I do but I didn't think you'd go this long.  Okay let's check some labs; I'll refill your meds.  Um and you had a flex sig in 2006 that showed some diverticulosis.  Are you interested at all in doing a colonoscopy where they go up through the bottom and they take a look for colon cancer?  The test you had in the past was sort of an incomplete test.

PATIENT J087
It was incomplete cause.

DOCTOR J087
It was uncomfortable.

PATIENT J087
It was real uncomfortable.  They could at least put uh a local.

DOCTOR J087
Yeah I agree.  So the one that I want you to get is more complete and they completely knock you out.

PATIENT J087
Well I don't need a complete knock out.

DOCTOR J087
But they sedate you so that you don't remember it.  You can respond like when they're asking you questions you can respond but you won't remember it so it's not painful or anything.

PATIENT J087
That's what mine was, that's where I got the @@@. 

DOCTOR J087
You want to do that okay.

PATIENT J087
I don't think they found anything unusual but they.

DOCTOR J087
No, no, they didn't.  It just wasn't a complete study so I just wasn't sure if you.

PATIENT J087
I've been going on the @@@ to work on the stomach.

DOCTOR J087
Oh okay, okay.  Well think about it.  If you decide you want to change your mind and do it we can set you up okay.  Um otherwise everything is looking pretty good.  You're doing a real good job.  Your blood pressure looks great.  You're taking your aspirin.  Um sounds like all the GU stuff and your urology stuff has gotten.

PATIENT J087
Right, no problem.

DOCTOR J087
Good well let me go talk to the boss.  Let me take a listen to you, then I'll talk to the boss and we'll get you out of here.  We'll send you to the Lab; we'll send you to the Pharmacy.

PATIENT J087
Okay.

DOCTOR J087
Alright.  Go ahead and lean forward just a little bit.  Forward, there you go.  Big breath.  Another one.  Good you can breathe normal, I'm gonna listen to your heart.  Good.  Let me go talk to the boss and we'll get you out of here.

DOCTOR J087

PATIENT J087

DOCTOR J087

DOCTOR J087
We can send you over to the Dermatology Clinic.  This is a little growth like you said.  But they're usually not too bad.  Does it bother you?

PATIENT J087
It uh.  No, it's a little reddish and a little swollen at one time.

DOCTOR J087
Okay.

PATIENT J087

DOCTOR J087
Okay, okay.  Um let's keep an eye on it.  If it changes in size, changes in color you come back and let me know okay.

PATIENT J087

DOCTOR J087
Um cause then I will send you over to the skin doctors.

PATIENT J087
Right, dermatologist.

DOCTOR J087
Yes, you got it.  Amlodipine 30 day supply.  So I changed your finasteride medication to be a three month supply, cause the way Urology wrote it out it was only 30 pills um otherwise I restarted your amlodipine and your lisinopril.  I'm going to put in for your labs now and you can just go get it.  Let's see.  And then why don't you come back and see me in three months, does that sound good?
