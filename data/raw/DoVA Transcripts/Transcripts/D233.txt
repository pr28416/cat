Time of Encounter:  @@@ 

DOCTOR D233
PATIENT?  

PATIENT D233
Huh?

DOCTOR D233
Come on back.

PATIENT D233
Good enough.  Good morning.

DOCTOR D233
Good morning, how are you doing?

PATIENT D233
Hmm I'm okay I think.

DOCTOR D233
I see you @@@, looking at your diabetes stuff, you can just sit in this chair.

PATIENT D233
Okay well.

DOCTOR D233
@@@.  Most of it um, @@@.

PATIENT D233
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we've had all the classes.

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
We've had most of the classes.

DOCTOR D233
All those you wanted anyway?

PATIENT D233
No I'll take any class you want me to go to; I'll sit there and try to learn something.

DOCTOR D233
Okay.

PATIENT D233
But.

DOCTOR D233
But.

PATIENT D233
You're killing me with the food.  You're not letting me eat enough.  I know that's really not a problem.  Oh three things I need to tell you.

DOCTOR D233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D233
I got about ten pills left.  I got about eight strips left.

DOCTOR D233
Okay.

PATIENT D233
And uh the high blood pressure that the pharmacist gave me I have not received it yet.

DOCTOR D233
Oh okay.

PATIENT D233
So I probably need to stop at the Pharmacy before I leave here.

DOCTOR D233
I don't know why you haven't gotten that yet.

PATIENT D233
Yeah.

DOCTOR D233
Let's see.

PATIENT D233
And I figured it's easier to tell you that I need strips before I run out than waiting until I get to the last one and say, doctor.

DOCTOR D233
That way I can mail them to you and you don't have to wait in line.

PATIENT D233
Ah the lines not a bit deal, I'm already here.

DOCTOR D233
Most people hate the lines.  

PATIENT D233
That.

DOCTOR D233
@@@ so much.

PATIENT D233
Yeah.  Look the line here takes less than 30 minutes.

DOCTOR D233
Really?

PATIENT D233
Yeah.

DOCTOR D233
I really @@@.

PATIENT D233
If you go to the county it takes two days.

DOCTOR D233
Oh when you keep comparing it to the county.

PATIENT D233
Hey this is a step up, trust me.

DOCTOR D233
You saw the county recently?

PATIENT D233
No, no.

DOCTOR D233
No, you just know for uh.

PATIENT D233
I know for a fact of how it goes.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah.  That is how it goes.

PATIENT D233
Cause you cannot find a doctor, over at the county waiting on somebody.

DOCTOR D233
I @@@.

PATIENT D233
Wow.

DOCTOR D233
So I am very familiar with how the county @@@.

PATIENT D233
Yeah.

DOCTOR D233
Actually, so familiar that I.

PATIENT D233
Left.

DOCTOR D233
Over at Loyola you can have rotations over there, but I wrote @@@ to tell people how to get people into the clinics over there.

PATIENT D233
Yeah you know what, like I said, even when I was in a position to pay for my own medical, I would never go to County cause like I say it would take me, while you were waiting on one of these great doctors, you could wait right there and die.

DOCTOR D233
Well actually I think the doctors though at Cook County are actually pretty good.

PATIENT D233
They probably are but if it takes them two days to get to see you, it doesn't help.

DOCTOR D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
Yeah and if you're not bleeding profusely you get ignored over there.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah this is a um.

PATIENT D233
I realize they have a lot of people to deal with but if you're not gushing blood I seen you know you could sit there 2-3 days waiting on somebody to see you.

DOCTOR D233
Okay so let's see.  Did you see DOCTOR, finally.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh and she gave me some high blood, she told me about some high blood pressure medicine.  I haven't gotten it yet.

DOCTOR D233
Okay so you're on Glargine 8 units.

PATIENT D233
Huh?

DOCTOR D233
Insulin.

PATIENT D233
No I'm on, what is that, @@@.

DOCTOR D233
12 units.

PATIENT D233
12 units of glycotrol or what is it?

DOCTOR D233
I call it Glargine; I think another name for it is Lantus.

PATIENT D233
That's the one Lantus.  

DOCTOR D233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D233
I can't even take a medicine without knowing what it is.

DOCTOR D233
And you're on @@@.  Did you want refills on the Lantus?

PATIENT D233
Uh I just got a bottle uh.

SECOND PERSON D233
I think it was on the @@@.

PATIENT D233
18th I think.

DOCTOR D233
You're on glipizide 10 twice a day?

PATIENT D233
Once a day.

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
Should be twice a day probably but.  

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
It was twice a day originally.

DOCTOR D233
Okay, got it down to .

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@ he takes one in the morning and nothing at night.

DOCTOR D233
Okay.

SECOND PERSON D233
He @@@ at night cause he went down pretty low.

DOCTOR D233
So he does the @@@ at night.

PATIENT D233
Yes.

DOCTOR D233
And then let's see and she said she wanted you on the Lisinopril.

PATIENT D233
Yes cause they said something about my liver, taking care of my liver.

DOCTOR D233
Really the @@@.

PATIENT D233
Yeah well I mean I'd like the liver to hang out you know, it's been here this long, keep it around a while.

DOCTOR D233
You definitely need that.  It does have some positive @@@.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D233
And the lisinopril also protects the kidneys.

PATIENT D233
Kidneys not liver.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
But it's not @@@ it’s  very weird drug.  

PATIENT D233
It would be easier if we just smoked a little pot.

DOCTOR D233
I don't think that that really works.  How much are you smoking?

PATIENT D233
I smoke about a half pack a day.

DOCTOR D233
Okay.

PATIENT D233
Oh I come down quite a bit.

DOCTOR D233
And how much, yeah you used to smoke a lot more.  Um how long have you been smoking 1/2 pack a day?

PATIENT D233
Since I started coming here.  I'm serious.  I was smoking about a pack and a half a day.

DOCTOR D233
Okay.

PATIENT D233
Yeah.

DOCTOR D233
Um do they have you on any nicotine cessation therapy?

PATIENT D233
No.

DOCTOR D233
Do you want to try it or try to wean yourself off?

PATIENT D233
I'll take whatever you tell me to take.

DOCTOR D233
Well I want you to stop smoking.

PATIENT D233
Okay.  Uh give me the stuff.

SECOND PERSON D233
What about the Chantix?  Have you, is that better than the nicotine?

DOCTOR D233
@@@ together also.

SECOND PERSON D233
Yeah.

DOCTOR D233
Then if they also, a lot of times people just seem to do much better.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D233
Um Chantix works well.  We've seen @@@.

SECOND PERSON D233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D233
Yeah well TV lies a lot.

SECOND PERSON D233
Depends on them.

DOCTOR D233
So a lot of people, so not a lot, some people have had the side effects.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D233
But I also know people who say it makes stopping smoking so easy for them.

SECOND PERSON D233
Yeah I heard that too.

DOCTOR D233
Tolerable that and the health benefits of not smoking I think are pretty close to make that acceptable.

PATIENT D233
Well I don't intend to commit suicide so we don't have to worry about.

DOCTOR D233
@@@ you know.

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
Homicide maybe.

DOCTOR D233
@@@ every day.

PATIENT D233
Homicide maybe.  Suicide not a chance.

DOCTOR D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
Ohh I resent that, I'm real safe until somebody pushes my buttons.

SECOND PERSON D233
Ahh.

DOCTOR D233
Do you want uh; do you have a stopping date in mind?

PATIENT D233
A what?

DOCTOR D233
A stop date?

PATIENT D233
Yesterday.

DOCTOR D233
Yesterday.

PATIENT D233
Look when I came here, you said I need to quit smoking cause I had this and that and I said okay alright.  Immediately I cut them back.  I was hoping to be through by the time I got back here to see you again.

DOCTOR D233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D233
But we haven't got there yet.

DOCTOR D233
Usually to start Chantix, you need a stop date and then you stop and you can take the nicotine replacement okay.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D233
Um now do you think you could take patches or gum?

PATIENT D233
Probably patches cause I don't chew gum.

DOCTOR D233
Okay.  Well gum is good to give people something to do with their mouth.

PATIENT D233
Ah I'd rather eat.

DOCTOR D233
Well.

SECOND PERSON D233
Patches will do.

PATIENT D233
Patches would probably work better yes.

DOCTOR D233
And then um, let's see.  No chest pain, no fevers, no shortness of breath?

SECOND PERSON D233
Shortness of breath yes.

PATIENT D233
A little bit yes, a little bit.

SECOND PERSON D233
And he wheezes.

DOCTOR D233
That's another reason why you should stop.

PATIENT D233
That's probably why I'm wheezing.

DOCTOR D233
Uh-huh.  @@@.  You just had a recent stress test, so there's really not much to do for the shortness of breath.

PATIENT D233
Well I'm, quit smoking that would be a great deal of help I'm sure.

DOCTOR D233
You had pulmonary function tests too didn't you, where you breathe into that machine and?
 
PATIENT D233
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

DOCTOR D233
So um.  How far can you walk without having to stop?

PATIENT D233
I walked three blocks yesterday and I damn near died.

DOCTOR D233
But you can do it?

PATIENT D233
Yeah I did it but uh like I said it wasn't easy.  And the other night I was walking to get a pack of cigarettes.  I came back home, I had to sit down and hold my head down and catch my breath.  My knees were hurting.

DOCTOR D233
Uh your lungs aren't even that terrible and they're blaming a lot of what's going on the fact that you have um, that you smoke.  Cause a lot of your signs are consistent with a smoker.

PATIENT D233
I been working on it.

DOCTOR D233
One thing at a time right?  All of a sudden you got a ton of health issues.

PATIENT D233
Yeah, that I didn't even know was there.  Well when I started smoking cigarettes they were a quarter a pack.  Now they almost $10 a pack.

DOCTOR D233
Isn’t that crazy?

PATIENT D233
Yep.

DOCTOR D233
That's good.  I don't know @@@ at all.

PATIENT D233
Yep you don't smoke.

DOCTOR D233
Nope.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D233
They did an @@@ right?

PATIENT D233
Yes.

DOCTOR D233
And you got an eye.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh, yes, well I got to do that over cause they didn't like the results.

DOCTOR D233
How come?

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@ whatever the results were, they didn't believe it was that poor so they had to redo it a certain day.

DOCTOR D233
Oh @@@ artifact.

SECOND PERSON D233
What is that, an artifact?

DOCTOR D233
Okay I just have to @@@ something that blocks the view of the @@@.

PATIENT D233
Okay.  Cause I would really hate to give up driving at night.

DOCTOR D233
It's still contrasting so @@@.  Okay so when are you going to redo that?

PATIENT D233
Sometime uh.

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@ about 30 days.

PATIENT D233
Right.

DOCTOR D233
And you just saw Ophtho on the 21st.

PATIENT D233
Right.

DOCTOR D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
Yes.  So sometime next month, now I'm in the middle of next month.

DOCTOR D233
And you got your flu shot.

PATIENT D233
Yes.

DOCTOR D233
You had it here.  @@@ harassing you.

PATIENT D233
Harassed? You haven't been harassing at all.  You've been very polite about it.

DOCTOR D233
How about a pneumonia shot?

PATIENT D233
Nobody said anything about that.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah you should get a pneumonia vaccine.

PATIENT D233
Okay.  Is it going to make me sick?

DOCTOR D233
There's no live virus in it.

PATIENT D233
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D233
You'll get a local reaction and then @@@ and anytime you get a vaccine you'll just kind of feel a little.

PATIENT D233
Lethargic yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR D233
And @@@ for a day or so.

PATIENT D233
I can live with that.

DOCTOR D233
So that's about it.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
Um let's see so should get that and let's see colonoscopy.

PATIENT D233
That doesn't sound like fun.

DOCTOR D233
No but you're overdo for one.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
Can you get one?

PATIENT D233
Set it up.  See how agreeable I am.

DOCTOR D233
You are.  You're like; I just really need to get my health in order right.

PATIENT D233
Yeah cause I mean I would like to be around a few more years.

DOCTOR D233
I think that's an excellent idea.

PATIENT D233
You know, uh let's see I got an Ear, Nose and Throat one day next week, no that's on the 4th I think.  Then I got a Psych evaluation on the 9th.  I got something else on the 15th.

SECOND PERSON D233
On the 15th.

DOCTOR D233
Okay and did you get the echo done too?

PATIENT D233
Yes, did I?

SECOND PERSON D233
Yes.

DOCTOR D233
Let me see that.  Uh you need to drop me a note if you want to go in earlier.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON D233
Um he did do that @@@.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah I remember it being reported to me.

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
You mean somebody didn't do their homework?  Go get em.

DOCTOR D233
Oh no, nothing happens that easily here.

PATIENT D233
This has got to be one of the smoothest operations I've seen in a while.  I mean short of being on base where the doctor only takes 10 seconds to get to you, this is a pretty good operation you all got here.

DOCTOR D233
I'm glad you think that.  Cause a lot of people hate the VA @@@.

PATIENT D233
Believe me it took me ten years to get in here, cause I thought you was all crazy over here.

DOCTOR D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
I haven't @@@.  The staff here and what I've had to deal with was easy.

DOCTOR D233
Good.

PATIENT D233
People are good people.  You know they talk to you if you've got some kind sense.

DOCTOR D233
Good.  Alright so you need med refills and I know you need to get the colonoscopy.  You need to do, I don't see any echo results here, I don't know why.  But your EF is normal.  Your @@@ contractions is normal.

PATIENT D233
What is that?

DOCTOR D233
It's how long your heart pumps blood out.

PATIENT D233
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D233
On the stress test.  I don't see any concern about that.  Um.

PATIENT D233
But they said I had a heart attack.

DOCTOR D233
It looks like you probably did have one in the past yeah.  It's what they call a fixed defect.

PATIENT D233
Well I didn't feel it.

SECOND PERSON D233
When you wrote it down, he used another word and @@@ clarify it more @@@ for benefits  @@@ saying that @@@.

DOCTOR D233
Well and they don't know when that happens.  They said the findings likely represent a small fixed defect.  So if he did have one it was a very small one and I can't tell you when that happened.

SECOND PERSON D233
Hmm.

PATIENT D233
Could you tell me why it happened?  Yeah.

DOCTOR D233
You’re diabetic.

PATIENT D233
That's true.

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@ wasn't a diabetic that long ago.  They said even in the military he was not a diabetic.

PATIENT D233
Diabetic and I had a physical in 2004 and I wasn't diabetic.

DOCTOR D233
Right but you'd probably been diabetic for a while.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
Even for a couple of years and you're a man over the age of 45.

PATIENT D233
There's no up side to getting old is there.

DOCTOR D233
Not really.  Besides eventually getting to retire.

PATIENT D233
Retirement would drive me crazy.  Sitting around doing nothing would definitely.

DOCTOR D233
You know it could have just happened.  It's very, very small.

SECOND PERSON D233
So small doesn't mean that it's not important.

DOCTOR D233
Right.

SECOND PERSON D233
I just wanted it out there so they would know that's a possibility of @@@.

DOCTOR D233
Right.

SECOND PERSON D233
Something is, something's making @@@ go up.

DOCTOR D233
Right.  Well you know to be honest they say that um, they say it's likely to represent a fixed defect, it just depends on the artifacts.  It's something that's there but doesn't mean anything.  So even on the reading they're not even 100% on that.  Cause it's pretty small and it's not reversible which means.

PATIENT D233
It's going to be there.

DOCTOR D233
The damage that is done is done, there's nothing to be done for that small area of the heart.  It’s already scarred over.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D233
And so right now @@@.

PATIENT D233
Try to avoid another one.

DOCTOR D233
Is to reduce your risk factors for any further heart disease.

SECOND PERSON D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
@@@ lowering the blood pressure, controlling the diabetes cause who knows how long his blood pressure has been a little high and with the diabetes and getting older and you know you carry all your weight right in the middle.

PATIENT D233
Right here.

DOCTOR D233
So you have what we could call um metabolic syndrome because your waist circumference is quite large, you have high blood pressure, diabetes, all of those things put you at increased risk for heart disease.

PATIENT D233
Okay.  So how do I lose the stomach, cause that's the only place I really need to lose any weight.  Need to lose any weight.  My pants are starting to falling off of me.  So I mean all my weight is right here.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah.

PATIENT D233
So I could lose, 10 of those, 20 of those.

DOCTOR D233
I really think @@@.  It just happens to be your body build.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
But your, that's where you carry your weight.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
You have skinny limbs?

PATIENT D233
No I have thick @@@ legs.

DOCTOR D233
Let me see the back of your legs.  Your legs look skinny.

PATIENT D233
What, look right here. I think I have big legs.

DOCTOR D233
So let's see um.  So your last hemoglobin was 13.

PATIENT D233
Yes.  She told me about that, we want to get it down to 7.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah.

PATIENT D233
Well below 7.

DOCTOR D233
And your PSA was 1.71.

PATIENT D233
What's that?

DOCTOR D233
That's the prostate-specific antigen.  It's a screening test for um.

SECOND PERSON D233
What was it, 1. what you say?

DOCTOR D233
1.71.

SECOND PERSON D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
Now the last time it was 04, usually after 4 then we would send someone to go get a biopsy.

SECOND PERSON D233
Really.

DOCTOR D233
All this means is if the PSA does become higher um I would probably repeat it and see what the trend is before we.

PATIENT D233
Yeah let's do that.  A biopsy sound like cutting and stuff.

DOCTOR D233
It does.

PATIENT D233
Yeah and that doesn't sound like fun.

DOCTOR D233
And you know that's part of the controversy of doing the PSA.  We have a lot of false positives.  We send a lot of men for biopsies that come back negative and the other thing is we find a lot of cancer that won’t ever materialize to anything.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
Cause prostate cancer often times can be very, it's because there's @@@ and does nothing.

PATIENT D233
What is the prostate, what does it do?

DOCTOR D233
It secretes um a lot of stuff, like the hormones and whatnot for men.  It sits right around your urethra and the ureters as they come in from the bladder to your penis.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
And so that's why when it gets enlarged @@@ all of your symptoms are urinary.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
You have increased @@@

PATIENT D233
Well I got that already.

DOCTOR D233
Hard time starting and stopping.

PATIENT D233
I don't have that.

DOCTOR D233
Um decreased flow, so the stream is slow.

PATIENT D233
No I don't have that.  I just go a lot.  But then I drink a lot too.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah if those things happen um you know they do have medication for that too.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

SECOND PERSON D233
If his PSA was 1.71.

DOCTOR D233
.71

SECOND PERSON D233
1.71.

DOCTOR D233
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON D233
That was not a real concern sign because it should be 0-4.

DOCTOR D233
That's the normal range.  I don't know what his PSA has been.

PATIENT D233
Before.

DOCTOR D233
Before.

SECOND PERSON D233
Oh.

DOCTOR D233
I can't really do anything unless it was like 16 or @@@.

SECOND PERSON D233
Hmm.

DOCTOR D233
I can't really do anything with a one-time number of 1.71.  And it isn’t the best test in the world but that's not recommended for everybody.  Being African-Americans is probably the reason why we follow it closely because of the increased rate and aggressiveness in @@@ gender.

PATIENT D233
Hmm.

DOCTOR D233
So it's something that I do want to watch but like I said it's just one number.  You could have been 1.7 for the last ten years and that may have been definitely nothing.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
You know.  It if goes up to four.

PATIENT D233
But we don't worry about it.

DOCTOR D233
Then you’d see a urologist.

PATIENT D233
Okay.  Well I'm leaving you in charge so far.  So far you been good, so I'm leaving you in charge.

DOCTOR D233
So your creatinine is great um.  The only thing that I would say that you need to.

PATIENT D233
Stop smoking and get my blood pressure under control.

DOCTOR D233
Well, I mean your cholesterol is beautiful.  I mean, I don't know that's probably been the best cholesterol I've seen for diabetics ever.  So uh without medications, I mean really fantastic.  So you want to do, things that work in your favor but as I said it's all a balancing act.

PATIENT D233
@@@ and everything else.

DOCTOR D233
You know I know you're concerned about the heart test but really all the test was saying is that there's something you could @@@.  There is something that you can, it's reversible so if you needed surgery that this @@@.

PATIENT D233
I don't like either one of those words.

DOCTOR D233
But since it's not reversible we really not a whole lot we can do.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
@@@ if you're symptoms arise, if you're breathing has increased shortness of breath from your baseline.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D233
Um @@@, chest pain is just really, in a diabetic if you live, you really need to prevent symptoms of heart disease.  If you have nausea, really bad indigestion, those are things that probably you shouldn't ignore because diabetics don't present the same way that the typical heart disease.  The things like chest and left arm pain.

PATIENT D233
So like I get a little twinge up here you know and you know.

DOCTOR D233
Right.

PATIENT D233
But they never last more than you know 15, 20 minutes.

SECOND PERSON D233
Sometimes the numbness.

PATIENT D233
The numbness.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah but the numbness can be just the neuropathy because of the diabetes too.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D233
And I don't know how long you've had it, how long you've had it, it's been really bad.  With having your blood sugar going into 400s @@@.

PATIENT D233
Well I been down to 200, pretty much.

DOCTOR D233
What have they been reading at home?

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@.  I'd say averaging out at 195 and I could have missed something.

DOCTOR D233
@@@ blood sugars.

PATIENT D233
No this we got when we saw the Pharmacy.  But it's running about 200 average.

DOCTOR D233
Still a lot higher than we want them.

PATIENT D233
No but they're a lot better than they were when I first came in here.

SECOND PERSON D233
Not good enough.

PATIENT D233
I understand that's not good enough.  Give me credit for being improved.

SECOND PERSON D233
Yeah you improved okay.

DOCTOR D233
And you're on 12 units of Glargine in the morning.  @@@ right.

PATIENT D233
Yes.

DOCTOR D233
Are you on @@@.

PATIENT D233
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON D233
He just started being on the Lantus.

PATIENT D233
When I came from the Pharmacy.

SECOND PERSON D233
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
Yeah cause it was 10, then it was dropped to 8 and now it's pumped to 12.

SECOND PERSON D233
You were on 8.

DOCTOR D233
Consistently?

PATIENT D233
I'm doing the best I can.

DOCTOR D233
Uh-huh.  Alright, let's take a quick listen to you and um.  @@@.

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@.

DOCTOR D233
The podiatrist.

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@.

DOCTOR D233
Unless she wants you to be referred to Surgery, I would.

PATIENT D233
No.

DOCTOR D233
Other than conservative management which.

SECOND PERSON D233
Conservative management what is that?

DOCTOR D233
With um nonsteroidals like over-the-counter ibuprofen.

PATIENT D233
Ibuprofen does nothing but give me a headache.

DOCTOR D233
Okay.  What about Aleve?

PATIENT D233
I got some of those.

DOCTOR D233
The anti-inflammatories are the best um.  You said you were out of the syringes or the strips?

PATIENT D233
Strips.  I got half a box of syringes.  The strips are almost gone.  I got like 7, 8 maybe 10.  

DOCTOR D233
And then um you know I mean avoiding unnecessary trauma so.  Good to go upstairs, maybe not so good for you to go down.

PATIENT D233
Hmm.

DOCTOR D233
Going upstairs at least gives you the benefit of the cardiac work.

PATIENT D233
Yeah if you go up you got to get down.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah but you can take the elevator down.

PATIENT D233
Uh we don't have an elevator in the house.

DOCTOR D233
Oh well I mean when you're at places like this. Really, I mean

PATIENT D233
But if I went three blocks yesterday to get a pack of cigarettes.

DOCTOR D233
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D233
It's really not worth it.

DOCTOR D233
No.

PATIENT D233
The stress, you know, to go three blocks to get a pack cigarettes.

DOCTOR D233
Give me a deep breath in and out.

PATIENT D233
Yeah.

DOCTOR D233
Okay.  Which knee?

PATIENT D233
Both of them.

DOCTOR D233
Both of them.

PATIENT D233
They crack sometimes when I.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah it's called crepitus.  Go on and kick out.

SECOND PERSON D233
It's called what?

DOCTOR D233
Crepitus.

SECOND PERSON D233
Crepitus.

DOCTOR D233
Just a sign of uh.

PATIENT D233
Old age.

DOCTOR D233
Of osteoarthritis.

PATIENT D233
You got all kinds of nice things to say don't you.

DOCTOR D233
It's um; it's just one of those things that happens.

PATIENT D233
Yeah you getting old.

DOCTOR D233
You were in the military; you probably did a lot of physical activity.

PATIENT D233
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR D233
And your knees are one of your weightbearing joints and so it's one of the first to go.

PATIENT D233
To go, like a load bearing wall in an apartment.

DOCTOR D233
@@@ and a lot of times when you do have knee issues you end up with hip issues because the way you walk.

PATIENT D233
You're just a fun person today aren't you.

DOCTOR D233
Oh.  So really taking anti-inflammatory medications like Aleve is a good thing to do.  We'll be watching your kidney function anyway because of the other medications that we have you on.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
So the things I'm going to need to do for you today is renew your meds, colonoscopy.

PATIENT D233
We're going to a colonoscopy today.

DOCTOR D233
Not today.

PATIENT D233
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D233
I'll put in a referral but you need to get labs, so what I'll probably have you do is get all those labs in about a month after you start taking the lisinopril.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
To make sure the lisinopril isn't doing anything to your kidneys.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
Some people it does bump, does cause the kidney function to drop a bit.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
Um but the benefits of the lisinopril in a diabetic outweigh that by a lot.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
Um and then.

PATIENT D233
So I'll go down there and get that stuff.

DOCTOR D233
Well yeah, you should get that medication.  You already got your pneumonia vaccination.

PATIENT D233
No.

DOCTOR D233
You did.

PATIENT D233
I had a flu shot.

DOCTOR D233
No but it's in the chart, they recorded it.  You got it on the 20th of August.

PATIENT D233
Oh I did.

DOCTOR D233
You did.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
They snuck it in there without you even knowing.

PATIENT D233
Okay.  They snuck up on me.

DOCTOR D233
I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
@@@

(DOCTOR OUT:  52:57  DOCTOR IN:  65:04)

DOCTOR D233
Um and I spoke to DOCTOR and she preferred to defer the colonoscopy for right now until we get everything else.

PATIE D233
I need to get the labs done.

DOCTOR D233
Well just get everything else kind of under control too.  

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
Um and then she wanted me to @@@.  Lisinopril I just wonder if we need it.  Did they have you discontinue it?

PATIENT D233
I never had it.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah, that's why I won’t renew it.  I'm going to discontinue it.

PATIENT D233
So that's for the blood pressure.

DOCTOR D233
Well, yeah and I want to, I want to just reorder it so you can pick it up today.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

SECOND PERSON D233
@@@.

PATIENT D233
Ah well, one thing nice about computer you can always override them.

DOCTOR D233
Sometimes.

PATIENT D233
No all the time.  There's a way to override it, trust me.  It might not like it but it can be overridden.  

DOCTOR D233
And then I need to, let's see.  I need to put in a non-formulary request for the Chantix and we were also discussing the patch with the Chantix and you need, um I'm as familiar.  @@@ the Wellbutrin for depression.

PATIENT D233
I ain't got depression.  I'm not depressed.

DOCTOR D233
Well it's something @@@ for the next few days.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
@@@ So my attending decided  @@@@.

PATIENT D233
Okay that'll work.  Don't give me too many things to do at one time, I get confused.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah I can, let me see something.  No it won't let me do Chantix.  You know the VA has a lot of things that are kind of @@@.  It won't let me do Chantix unless you've tried the nicotine patch.

PATIENT D233
Okay.  We'll do it the hard way.

DOCTOR D233
Do you want to try the patches?

SECOND PERSON D233
Are you talking about the Nicorette?  That's the best you got, cause I don't, that's the best you have?  That you we can get into.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah.

PATIENT D233
Whatever.  I trust you still.

DOCTOR D233
So.  That you need to get started right away.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
The patches.  But you need to stop smoking.  

SECOND PERSON D233
You know what I'm saying, you can't, you don't. How do you graduatlly?

PATIENT D233
Chantix lets you go, no.

DOCTOR D233
The Chantix does but.

PATIENT D233
But the Nicorette doesn't.

DOCTOR D233
I think what it is a lot of medications that are newer or more expensive since there are @@@ last one.

PATIENT D233
Okay when am I going to see you again?

DOCTOR D233
In two months.

PATIENT D233
Okay so that'll be around Christmas.

DOCTOR D233
Yeah.

PATIENT D233
Okay @@@ we'll keep working at it.

DOCTOR D233
Um I'll probably order all the labs then so don't worry about labs today.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

DOCTOR D233
Um, yeah I’m sorry, I would, so what I'd say to you is that um I would try to get down to maybe like six cigarettes or so a day.

PATIENT D233
Well I'm down, like I say about half a pack.

DOCTOR D233
Get down to five or six cigarettes a day.  When you cut down to that, pick a stop day, stop and start using the patches.

PATIENT D233
Okay.

SECOND PERSON D233
So don't use the patches until.

DOCTOR D233
Your stop date.

SECOND PERSON D233
