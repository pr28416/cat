No.

DOCTOR G672
No okay.

PATIENT G672
No I think in the last six months or so, maybe longer.  But it's a very weird feeling.  Just I can't relax.  I never feel relaxed.  It's just a general feeling of malaise.

DOCTOR G672
Okay.

PATIENT G672
It's pretty bad.

DOCTOR G672
And how are you feeling since getting that tumor resected?

PATIENT G672
That didn't seem any different you know.

DOCTOR G672
Hmm.  Are you having any other problems?  

PATIENT G672
Um, well the last, yesterday I came down with this illness.  A very uh, almost like a flu, flu-like symptoms and it came yesterday.  Today I felt so bad I didn't know if I was going to be able to drive to the hospital you know.

DOCTOR G672
Okay what kind of symptoms like, you’re sick to your stomach, do you have fevers?

PATIENT G672
Which I've had since yesterday.

DOCTOR G672
Yeah.

PATIENT G672
Yeah kind of achy.

DOCTOR G672
Uh-huh.  Let's see, I'm just looking here about when you saw the neurologist last time.  

PATIENT G672
Quite a while ago.

DOCTOR G672
So you saw them in January and.

PATIENT G672
Yeah she gave me gabapentin.

DOCTOR G672
Yeah.

PATIENT G672
I don't know if that does any good or not.

DOCTOR G672
Um, gabapentin can work really well if you're on the right amount.  How much are you taking now?

PATIENT G672
I'm taking two.

DOCTOR G672
You're taking two at night?  Uh do you want.

PATIENT G672
I changed it to three; I went up to three at night.

DOCTOR G672
Okay and is that helping at all?

PATIENT G672
I don't think it's any better than it was when I was taking one.

DOCTOR G672
Oh okay.  You don't think it's any better huh?

PATIENT G672
I beg your pardon?

DOCTOR G672
It's not any better?

PATIENT G672
No, I don't think so.

DOCTOR G672
Okay.  Alright.  Let's see.  

PATIENT G672
I just taking that new one.  I just started taking the @@@.

DOCTOR G672
Let's see, okay.  How's your vision?  Has it gotten better since they took that, removed the tumor?

PATIENT G672
Yeah it has.  My peripheral vision is better in my good eye.  I've only got one good eye.

DOCTOR G672
Alright.  So that did get better.

PATIENT G672
Yes.

DOCTOR G672
Good.

PATIENT G672
Yeah.

DOCTOR G672
Alright.  Are you still seeing a cardiologist outside of here?

PATIENT G672
Uh no, no I'm not.

DOCTOR G672
You see cardiology here.

PATIENT G672
I haven't seen a cardiologist for quite a while.  I don't remember when my last appointment was uh.

DOCTOR G672
Okay.

PATIENT G672
My blood pressure is good.

DOCTOR G672
You probably do have, you're just right on the borderline of diabetes and uh right now it's not really bad enough that we would probably treat it.

PATIENT G672
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G672
But we do want to keep an eye on it.

PATIENT G672
Okay.

DOCTOR G672
Let's see.  Are you urinating okay?  You're following with Urology how's that?

PATIENT G672
Yeah I'm taking that new medication.  I just started that a couple days ago, tolterodine and that helps.

DOCTOR G672
It does.

PATIENT G672
Yeah because I was having to go every hour or so.

DOCTOR G672
Okay.

PATIENT G672
And now I'm only about two or three times a night.

DOCTOR G672
Okay.

PATIENT G672
So that seemed to help.

DOCTOR G672
Let's see.  Your cholesterol looks good.  Check the CBC alright.  So we can help you out with this numbness and tingling a little bit, that would.

PATIENT G672
Oh that would be great.

DOCTOR G672
That would be the best thing.

PATIENT G672
Yes.

DOCTOR G672
Have a seat up here for me.

PATIENT G672
I really hate that feeling.

DOCTOR G672
Well how's your wife doing?

PATIENT G672
She's doing great.

DOCTOR G672
Sometimes she's here with you.

PATIENT G672
I beg your pardon?

DOCTOR G672
Some days I've seen her here with you.

PATIENT G672
Yeah.

DOCTOR G672
How is like your memory and everything like that doing?

PATIENT G672
Good, I think.

DOCTOR G672
Slip off your glasses for me.  Look straight ahead.  Open your mouth.  Okay.  @@@.  Are you uh doing most things on your own, like your day to day stuff, or does your wife help you out?

PATIENT G672
Oh yeah.  I do most things on my own.

DOCTOR G672
Okay take some big breaths, again alright, relax.  Stomach is okay?

PATIENT G672
Yeah.

DOCTOR G672
Any blood in the stool?

PATIENT G672
No.

DOCTOR G672
Black stool?

PATIENT G672
No.

DOCTOR G672
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT G672
Do you think that anything can be done for that feeling I have?

DOCTOR G672
I don't know.  I mean that can be a tough thing to treat.  I mean gabapentin can be a good drug but the problem is you have to get it up to a high enough dose or it doesn't do much.

PATIENT G672
Oh.  Okay, well I'm taking three presently.

DOCTOR G672
I know.  Let me go chat with one of my bosses back here.  I'll be right back in okay.

PATIENT G672
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT: 95:45  DOCTOR IN:  98:41)

DOCTOR G672
Thank you sir.  Taking a nap there?

PATIENT G672
Yeah.

DOCTOR G672
You know, if you want to, I'm waiting for one of the attendings, one of my bosses back there.  He's in the middle of something.

PATIENT G672
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G672
Um so if you don't mind I can go ahead and have you kind of get the check-out process started.  Um just don't leave um.  After you check out, you know the Waiting Room up front?

PATIENT G672
Yeah.

DOCTOR G672
You know what I'm talking about?  Can you just wait there until I come and talk to you?  Um I don't you to, I feel bad you having to sit here um.

PATIENT G672
Yeah.

DOCTOR G672
Um you know I think it might speed it up a little bit you getting out of here and getting home uh.

PATIENT G672
Yeah.

DOCTOR G672
Uh I guess he's in the middle of admitting a patient to the hospital.

PATIENT G672
How long do you think it'll be?

DOCTOR G672
Five minutes.

PATIENT G672
Oh okay.

DOCTOR G672
But I just hate for you to have to sit here so I was thinking, what I'm thinking about doing is uh you know you're due for some blood testing uh, just to check the sugar and the cholesterol.

PATIENT G672
Yeah.

DOCTOR G672
Um and I'm gonna talk to him about the neuropathy pain to see if he agrees with.  See part of the thing is you're also seeing Neurology, who are kind of helping manage that so I don't want to step on their toes and change what they were doing but I think we may be able to help you out somewhere.  Uh.

PATIENT G672
Yeah.

DOCTOR G672
Let's uh, if you want, as long as you promise me that you're not gonna escape on me before I talk to you, this may just help speed things up.  So if you want to go check out okay and uh then I'll come find you in the Waiting Room.

PATIENT G672
In the Waiting Room okay.

DOCTOR G672
Yep, sound good?

PATIENT G672
Okay there's one thing that I was supposed to, the nurse left me a note here.

DOCTOR G672
Oh yeah what's this?

PATIENT G672
I see that the lisinopril, the lisinopril is not on the list.  

DOCTOR G672
@@@ list.  So it looks like lisinopril needs to be added to your online prescription list.  You've been taking this @@@ since your tumor surgery and your blood pressure is stable.

PATIENT G672
Yeah she uh, she orders it on the internet and she says it's not on the list.

DOCTOR G672
Where do you get it?  Do you get it from the VA or you get it from somewhere else?

PATIENT G672
No, from the VA.

DOCTOR G672
Cause I don't think you've been getting it from us.  Did they give it to you at Loyola?

PATIENT G672
Uh I'm pretty sure I've been getting it from the VA.

DOCTOR G672
It says since your tumor surgery, so I wonder if they put you on that at Loyola.

PATIENT G672
Oh maybe.

DOCTOR G672
Hmm.  

PATIENT G672
You know what I think it's on my list.

DOCTOR G672
I don't think it's on your list.  @@@ potassium, @@@.

PATIENT G672
Oh I guess not.

DOCTOR G672
So you must be getting it from somewhere else.

PATIENT G672
Okay.

DOCTOR G672
Okay.

PATIENT G672
Can you add that to the list cause she wants to order all my medications.  She usually gets it from the VA on the internet yeah.

DOCTOR G672
Alright and your blood pressure was good today huh?  Yeah.

PATIENT G672

DOCTOR G672
