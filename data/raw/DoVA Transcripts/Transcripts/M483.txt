Time of Encounter:  @@@  

DOCTOR M483
Nice to see you.

PATIENT M483
How you been?

DOCTOR M483
Good, how are you?  Take a seat.

PATIENT M483
Thanks.

DOCTOR M483
How was your holiday?

PATIENT M483
Uh uneventful which is good.

DOCTOR M483
Um how have you been, anything new going on, anything different?

PATIENT M483
Uh no.  Uh, probably just a little cold and uh, so I just had to use some medicine and you know I get rid of the phlegm and pretty much.

DOCTOR M483
Uh-huh.

PATIENT M483
@@@ nothing new @@@.

DOCTOR M483
How about uh the Waldenstrom stuff is that all on the back burner?

PATIENT M483
Uh well, I'm being monitored uh I haven't uh.

DOCTOR M483
@@@.

PATIENT M483
Yeah I had, I went over there to get my port @@@ uh get the labs from them cause they did the labs so they should be coming through.

DOCTOR M483
Yeah I'm looking at them now.  They're pretty good.  Nothing abnormal in the labs.

PATIENT M483
Okay.  Good.  Uh the one thing that I was wondering about and uh I think I talked to you last time over the phone is uh, uh, I went for a chiropractic um, I can't without my teeth I guess, I don't know I'm not sure.

DOCTOR M483
Yeah.

PATIENT M483
But uh and I initiated that uh on my own because I was having trouble uh with my back sleeping and stuff like that so uh, that has been a burden to me uh but I was wondering am I in any way eligible for uh reimbursement for those uh.

DOCTOR M483
I don't think that the VA does anything with chiropractic services.

PATIENT M483
Okay.

DOCTOR M483
What about physical therapy through the VA would you be interested in trying that?

PATIENT M483
Uh I don't know if that's the same thing?

DOCTOR M483
It's not but it's the best thing that they offer.

PATIENT M483
Alright.

DOCTOR M483
So what it would be is I would send you to see a physical rehabilitation doctor and he would do an exam on you.  He would figure out, you know you have certain limitations or certain weaknesses, he would send you to a therapist and they would help to work on strengthening those.  Um for a lot of people it's very helpful.

PATIENT M483
Okay.

DOCTOR M483
You could always go and see if you don't like it, you don't have to do it anymore.  You know it's not gonna, it's not going to bind you in to anything.

PATIENT M483
Alrighty.

DOCTOR M483
Uh, would you like me to, I could put in a consult so they would see you.

PATIENT M483
Okay that's fine.

DOCTOR M483
And then it's up to you know what time you want to do it but.

PATIENT M483
Yeah right now I'm two months into the chiropractor.

DOCTOR M483
Okay.

PATIENT M483
And then again it's helped me out uh and I'm uh up tight you might say.

DOCTOR M483
All in the back?

PATIENT M483
Yeah, well I've got arthritis in the small back, small of the back anyway.  That was something that was uh found in an MRI or x-ray.

DOCTOR M483
Did you hurt your back at any point?

PATIENT M483
Years ago uh, as a bakery salesman I threw it out so it has been tender.

DOCTOR M483
I'm telling them what's wrong with you. (Doctor typing on keyboard)

PATIENT M483
But uh the x-ray or the MRI uh showed uh arthritis in the small of the back.  

DOCTOR M483
Um do you know @@@.  Okay that'd be for a colonoscopy @@@.  Did you get your shots, it looks like you did.  You got your immunization on November 5th.

PATIENT M483
Yeah, 2002, I need a colonoscopy, that was the last time.  

DOCTOR M483
@@@ follow-up.

PATIENT M483
So it's every ten years.

DOCTOR M483
Every ten years cause yours was negative.  Are you going to see the hematologist in the clinic, @@@ where he is?

PATIENT M483
Uh I got @@@.

DOCTOR M483
Yeah.

PATIENT M483
Uh and that's gonna be coming up soon, I think it's the 8th.  The 6th or the 8th.

DOCTOR M483
Okay, DOCTOR is a good friend.

PATIENT M483
Okay.

DOCTOR M483
She's a very nice girl.

PATIENT M483
Yeah.

DOCTOR M483
We worked in med school together.

PATIENT M483
Oh great.

DOCTOR M483
I know her and her husband pretty well.  Alright you're also due for some blood work.  Now your due for a PSA check.  Your last PSA was elevated, so I'm going to put um.

PATIENT M483
I've got to be here Monday so I can do it then.

DOCTOR M483
Let's do it then.  Let's just do it then.

PATIENT M483
Would I go back to uh.

DOCTOR M483
Where you got it today.

PATIENT M483
In the, okay back to Oncology.

DOCTOR M483
Oh no, no, no I didn't know that's what they're going to do; it's the first floor regular laboratory.

PATIENT M483
Hmm, first floor.

DOCTOR M483
Yeah I forgot, I forgot that you go upstairs to the special one.

PATIENT M483
Right.

DOCTOR M483
And then uh your cholesterol is fantastic, you know a little bit, but not bad at all, I mean it's pretty good.  Well let's see what you got you.  But you take no medications right?

PATIENT M483
Nothing, no.  Other than Tylenol and Advil and stuff like that to help alleviate some of the unpleasantness of the back.

DOCTOR M483
Were you ever a smoker?

PATIENT M483
At one time yes I was.

DOCTOR M483
How long were you a smoker?

PATIENT M483
Uh, I'd say from about my 16th birthday to probably my 30th, probably about 15 years.

DOCTOR M483
Yeah.

PATIENT M483
At least.

DOCTOR M483
But then you quit 30 years ago.

PATIENT M483
Yes, yeah but I had it and I wish I could have convinced my sister to do it.  She's got emphysema.

DOCTOR M483
Yeah that's when it gets tough.

PATIENT M483
I had an uncle that died from emphysema and I and believe me there's nothing worse than to go to reposition your uncle who was 6' 3" 250 pounds and then he's probably 90 pounds then and uh he tells you to get the hell out of the room.

DOCTOR M483
Oh I know it's hard.

PATIENT M483
Because that's what I was thinking you know.

DOCTOR M483
How is your mood?

PATIENT M483
Uh generally okay.  Uh I have uh problems being estranged from my uh family.

DOCTOR M483
I remember you told me about that.

PATIENT M483
Yeah and uh it's really.  I tried to investigate as many avenues as I can but it seems like nobody wants to withdraw the.

DOCTOR M483
Is there anyone in your family you still talk to?

PATIENT M483
Uh my mother and my two sisters no.  Uh I don't try to communicate with the cousin, who is now taking care of his mother.  I don't want to cause anybody any.

DOCTOR M483
More problems?

PATIENT M483
Yeah no, that's not what I want.  I wanted uh visitation rights to my mother and my sister denied me that.  She is my mother's caretaker.  I have two sisters and the one that's the caretaker is.

DOCTOR M483
But they live close by?

PATIENT M483
Uh, what my mother's house is in Chicago, I live in Overland Park.

DOCTOR M483
Okay.

PATIENT M483
So that's not really that far away.

DOCTOR M483
Yeah @@@.  Um every time you come in here, we need to look @@@.  This time your blood pressure is a little elevated and have they ever tried you on blood pressure medications or ever talked to you about this?

PATIENT M483
Years ago.

DOCTOR M483
Yeah how did you tolerate those?

PATIENT M483
Uh, it was okay but since I went through the chemo and the plasmapheresis uh they took me off the blood pressure medications so now, I feel comfortable about it really.

DOCTOR M483
You feel you wish you had some or you don't want any?

PATIENT M483
No I don't really want any.

DOCTOR M483
Okay, well then we'll just pull them off.  Your blood pressure is not terrible but uh, we'll hold off for now and if it gets worse in the future we might have to reconsider.

PATIENT M483
Hmm.

DOCTOR M483
Okay, everything else looks good.  I mean your numbers are good.  Your labs are fantastic.  Your @@@ seems to be very under control um.  There's not much else um.  You'll know we'll have @@@ in the summer but there's not much else other than we'll get that toxic value checked tomorrow.

PATIENT M483
If you could, uh well you said and there's no chiropractic uh uh.

DOCTOR M483
It was a physical rehab guy, I put that one out.

PATIENT M483
Okay, we'll work towards that and see what happens there because uh I noticed that uh with uh the chiropractor there's two parts, one is muscle and one is bones and uh it seems to be uh working.  I mean I feel better, this is over two months.  Now I feel uh a lot more comfortable.  I still ache in the morning when I get up but.

DOCTOR M483
They might be able; the rehab doctor might be able to help you with that.  That's what their whole area is.  I know you prefer seeing a chiropractor but they're very good with specific exercises and stretching to help out bones and muscle pains.

PATIENT M483
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M483
So we're gonna get you in to see them and see what they have to offer but I think that that would be helpful to you as well.

PATIENT M483
Okay and uh I just worry about the other things, uh the vision as far as at the Waldenstrom.

DOCTOR M483
Yeah.

PATIENT M483
And also I still have the tinnitus in my ears and uh the one ear is particularly deaf but uh the tinnitus it bothers me that it's going to be with me the rest of my life, I understand?

DOCTOR M483
I think some of those are side effects as part of the Waldenstrom spectrum.

PATIENT M483
@@@ yeah.  Uh is Waldenstrom an organization or uh that has a track record and Waldenstrom patients uh they are more or less people that have it and go through it and what their experiences are?

DOCTOR M483
@@@.  Yeah I'll have to look.  I know DOCTOR might know that too because that's more of her area.

PATIENT M483
Alright.

DOCTOR M483
But I @@@.  Do you have access to a computer?

PATIENT M483
Yeah.

DOCTOR M483
Yeah I would check out the internet, if you type in Waldenstrom, I'm sure you'll find a group of people living with this.

PATIENT M483
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR M483
They kind of describe some of their symptoms and what they go through.

PATIENT M483
Uh-huh.  I would like to be @@@.

DOCTOR M483
Up-to-date.

PATIENT M483
Yeah and prepare for, I live alone and I have to prepare for some sort of uh, uh long term uh care that I can provide for myself and have the foresight.

DOCTOR M483
To take care of that.

PATIENT M483
Yeah.  

DOCTOR M483
Okay, ask her.  I'll look through; I haven't really looked for it.  You're actually the only patient I've ever taken care of with Waldenstrom.

PATIENT M483
After all my life, to finally become unique.  There's only about 300 million a year but.

DOCTOR M483
Right.  I don't know anybody else like you.

PATIENT M483
Well, actually thank you (laughter).

DOCTOR M483
Well let me talk to my boss and I'll be right back and we'll take a listen to you.

DOCTOR M483
Okay, I'll take a peek, I'll take a listen to you and then I think we can do six months.  Um, you'll probably see DOCTOR in the meantime.

PATIENT M483
Right.  Uh that's next week.

DOCTOR M483

PATIENT M483
Yeah.  Everything will @@@.

DOCTOR M483

PATIENT M483

DOCTOR M483

PATIENT M483
Okay.

DOCTOR M483
It's up to you. Uh we can do just the blood test and if the blood test is elevated then we can talk about further testing.

PATIENT M483
Alright.

DOCTOR M483

PATIENT M483
Yeah.

DOCTOR M483
Okay, so otherwise I'm gonna take you over to see the nurse and then I'm gonna have you come see me in six months.  Uh I'll talk to DOCTOR and let her know about what's kind of going on and then she, we'll kind of communicate back and forth uh but otherwise everything looks pretty good.
