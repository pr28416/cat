PATIENT Y612
@@@ I have the surgery on the 16th.

DOCTOR Y612
Okay.  

PATIENT Y612
They wanted me to come in.

DOCTOR Y612
Sure, sure.  I kind of read a little about it.  So, um, were you having any urinary symptoms at all?  Any um pain when you go to the bathroom, when you urinate?  

PATIENT Y612
No.

DOCTOR Y612
Any increase in urination at all?

PATIENT Y612
Yea.  At night.

DOCTOR Y612
At nighttime.  Okay.  How long has that been going on for?

PATIENT Y612
It has been going on for a while.  I take the little prostrate pills.

DOCTOR Y612
Okay.  You take water pills as well right?

PATIENT Y612
You know what? I can’t find my water pill.  I need some water pill.

DOCTOR Y612
Okay.  @@@.

PATIENT Y612
You know what else I need? I need an asthma pump real bad.  My pump is out.

DOCTOR Y612
Oh your inhaler?

PATIENT Y612
Inhaler, yeah.  But you know, @@@.

DOCTOR Y612
You have refills on all of this stuff.  All you have to do is call the pharmacy.

PATIENT Y612
@@@.  

DOCTOR Y612
Yeah.  You can actually stop by the pharmacy and they will give you everything.  @@@.  Okay.  And so the, the increase urinating at night has been going on for a while you said?

PATIENT Y612
They gave me them prostate pills.

DOCTOR Y612
Uh huh.

PATIENT Y612
So I been taking them now.

DOCTOR Y612
Any accidents at all where you couldn’t make it to the bathroom?

PATIENT Y612
Yeah.  Yeah.

DOCTOR Y612
Does that happen all of the time? 

PATIENT Y612
No.  Just last night it happened.  It happened last night.

DOCTOR Y612
Has it been happening a lot or just once, that one time?

PATIENT Y612
No, ah, maybe two or three weeks maybe.

DOCTOR Y612
Okay.  And you said your surgery is on the 16th right?

PATIENT Y612
Hm hmm.  

DOCTOR Y612
Um, any fevers or chills at home at all?

PATIENT Y612
Nope.

DOCTOR Y612
Okay.  Now, so we were discussing, so your urine, it grew a bacteria, was the reason that put up red flag @@@ but your actual, your urinalysis, your urine was good itself.

PATIENT Y612
Okay.

DOCTOR Y612
Um we look at, you know we send it for culture which takes a few days and we also look at the results @@@ few numbers.

PATIENT Y612
So everything is good then?

DOCTOR Y612
So, yeah, I think um, this bacteria doesn’t really mean you have a urinary tract infection because typically if somebody doesn’t have any symptoms of urinary tract infection like pain when they urinate and things like that, then we’re willing to say that’s just, you know bacteria that kind of either in the urine tract so then it can contaminate the cup even.  It doesn’t necessarily mean that we have to treat with antibiotics.

PATIENT Y612
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR Y612
Okay.  So I think, that is just something that, they wanted you to @@@.

PATIENT Y612
@@@.

DOCTOR Y612
So I think you are doing well with that.  Any other problems at all?

PATIENT Y612
No.

DOCTOR Y612
There’s a bunch of stuff you guys talked about.  Did you get a chance to do your pulmonary function test yet?  I know you were probably busy doing the ENT stuff, but.

PATIENT Y612

DOCTOR Y612
The lung test?  Where they put like a thing around, you did it in 2008 at home time. Where they had you breathe in the machine and then it measures like your.

PATIENT Y612

DOCTOR Y612

PATIENT Y612
Yea I did that.  

DOCTOR Y612
When was that done?

PATIENT Y612
Ah, a couple of weeks ago.  @@@ three or four weeks ago.  Where they put you in the little tank thing and put the thing in there?  What you call that @@@?

DOCTOR Y612

PATIENT Y612
Breathing test or something?

DOCTOR Y612
Yup, exactly.  

PATIENT Y612
