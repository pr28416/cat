DOCTOR I653
Yeah that's typically uh musculoskeletal pain.

PATIENT I653

DOCTOR I653
Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide.  And are you taking carvedilol Coreg?

PATIENT I653
Yes.

DOCTOR I653
It looks like some of these expired; I can try and reorder a bunch of them for you.  Your blood sugar looks pretty well controlled, that was quite a while ago, that was September.  So we want to get repeat blood work on you before you see your next doctor.

PATIENT I653
Okay.

DOCTOR I653
Okay, I'll reorder that Coreg to make sure you get that uh.  You're on Plavix as well?

PATIENT I653
Yes.

DOCTOR I653
And you're wearing a BiPAP machine, CPAP machine?  And you're not smoking?

PATIENT I653
No.

DOCTOR I653
Are you on the bupropion?

PATIENT I653
Yeah it's the pain medicine.  I have back pain.

DOCTOR I653
No this is a medication for smoking.

PATIENT I653
Oh @@@.

DOCTOR I653
Okay.

PATIENT I653
No I'm done, getting too old.

DOCTOR I653
Your thyroid function is normal.  Okay, have a seat up here.  Take a few deep breaths.  Just breathe normally.  So you know looking at your stuff here, I would continue the same medications for now.

PATIENT I653
Yeah.

DOCTOR I653
Um, really I think the thyroid function looks good, that was all normal from today.  We don't need to change anything for now.  Otherwise we'll need to have you, unfortunately, get another doctor.  I apologize.

PATIENT I653
No need to apologize.

DOCTOR I653
If I would have known that's why you were coming in I would have tried to change things but uh I didn't know.

PATIENT I653
No problem.  @@@.

DOCTOR I653
Um is there anything else I can do for you?

PATIENT I653
No everything is fine doc.

DOCTOR I653
Well let's try and set you free here.  

PATIENT I653
I’m so sleepy, why is that?  I'm supposed to be using @@@.  Sometimes I just go to sleep eight hours, I'm perfectly fine, no problems and yesterday I was shopping with my wife, sleeping in the car and I @@@, I was sleeping, why is that?

DOCTOR I653
Now are you wearing the CPAP the entire time at night?

PATIENT I653
No.

DOCTOR I653
That machine.

PATIENT I653
Right no.

DOCTOR I653
How long do you wear it?

PATIENT I653
Sometimes I just kind of rip it, I would say.

DOCTOR I653
Right.

PATIENT I653
But I would say six months it was perfect and I didn't change any.

DOCTOR I653
Um that I mean that is likely why you've got this obesity hypoventilation syndrome uh so it's very important that you wear that CPAP.

PATIENT I653
Okay.

DOCTOR I653
You know other things could be thyroid problems but we just got your blood work today and that looks okay.  So you know the most.

PATIENT I653
Now that's just my question.  I don't why, is it something like being tired.  Cause everything is the same every day.

DOCTOR I653
The thing with your diagnosis and this obesity hypoventilation syndrome, that's one of the symptoms.  Uh it's just daytime fatigue, the sleepiness.  So if you don't wear the CPAP the entire time, you know if you're wearing your CPAP all day and all night then we would say maybe we need to look into other things.

PATIENT I653
Yes.

DOCTOR I653
But even then you could still have symptoms because you're not, you're gas exchange isn't normal.

PATIENT I653
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I653
@@@ and it gets worse at night and when that happens, your CO2 starts to build up.  

PATIENT I653
Right.

DOCTOR I653
Your carbon dioxide starts to build up and you start feeling sleepy uh, so that's why it's important to keep that CPAP on because that will help maintain the normal level of carbon dioxide uh while you may still sleep well at night without it, you're gonna be sleepy during the day if those levels are high.  So that's why it's important to wear that mask uh.

PATIENT I653
But it's not every day.  For the last three or four days I've been, I bet you it'll be a couple more days and then I'll be normal again.

DOCTOR I653
You know I still think that's probably the.

PATIENT I653
@@@.

DOCTOR I653
Otherwise you know, from what I know about you and examining you, it's not clear.  That's the far and away the most likely culprit.

PATIENT I653
It seems like, it seems like after my open heart surgery, six months later I was passing out, passing out, passing out, right, so I say doctor I think something's wrong.  I had to go to the hospital like @@@ weeks.  They couldn't figure out anything so you know what I did, I stopped taking the @@@ then it disappeared.  @@@ is a medicine, some kind of a reaction and still doctors are worrying me.  I said doctor that's what it is.  I said, you see what happened I took the medicine right at home and I could see after 15 minutes @@@ it could go down.  

DOCTOR I653
Yeah that's.

PATIENT I653
Okay and then I could @@@ like my head is turning @@@.

DOCTOR I653
Yeah.

PATIENT I653
And I passed out and was in the hospital for weeks, you know they couldn’t find anything wrong.  So @@@ I stopped taking medicines bang, I've @@@.

DOCTOR I653
So uh, it sounds like you're having allergic reactions.

PATIENT I653
Something yeah.

DOCTOR I653
You know you've been on all these other medicines for a while too, so that shouldn't be uh.

PATIENT I653
No but that was like eight years ago.

DOCTOR I653
Yeah.

PATIENT I653
Then I stopped taking, stopped taking the vitamin everything is fine.

DOCTOR I653
We'll get repeat blood work and uh you'll see a new doctor.

PATIENT I653
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR I653
Once again I apologize.

PATIENT I653
Alright.

DOCTOR I653
That it was scheduled. Uh if there's anything I can do to help you, let me know.

PATIENT I653
Thank you, have a nice day doctor.
