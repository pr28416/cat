DOCTOR V469 
Hi PATIENT.

PATIENT V469
How you doing?

DOCTOR V469
Oh thank you.  Right here.  A lot has happened to you @@@.

PATIENT V469
Yeah.

DOCTOR V469
I'm DOCTOR and I'll be seeing you today.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

DOCTOR V469
Nice to meet you.

PATIENT V469
So you're gonna be my new doctor?

DOCTOR V469
Yeah, yeah, yes.

PATIENT V469
Okay cause the last time I was here.

DOCTOR V469
It was a while ago right?

PATIENT V469
Yeah well I had come in on an emergency cause what the doc said it was a heart attack.

DOCTOR V469
You had a heart attack.

PATIENT V469
Right.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah so last time you were here you had a heart attack in August.

PATIENT V469
Right.  So before that I didn't know that my regular doctor wasn't here anymore.

DOCTOR V469
@@@.

PATIENT V469
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
So I been trying to get here but for some reason I've been missing my appointments in a while.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah @@@ come up for you?

PATIENT V469
Man I missed about three, four appointments.

DOCTOR V469
@@@.  Oh what happened with?

PATIENT V469
Well I don't know I guess with me, to see a doctor I about have to have, there better be a need you know.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
It's got to be something that, you know, first of all I have to go see someone.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
I kind of put everything else as part of me @@@ cause I'm not you know.  Like I was telling the nurse I was having problems with taking the medications I was given after my heart attack where I'd be getting headaches.

DOCTOR V469
Which one?

PATIENT V469
All of them, I guess all of them.

DOCTOR V469
All of them.

PATIENT V469
I guess so, I was on four.

DOCTOR V469
Okay.

PATIENT V469
And after I would take it you know maybe at night, maybe about an hour or so later I'd be having a headache.

DOCTOR V469
There's one called Plavix.

PATIENT V469
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V469
That one is more important than anything else cause that, I can explain to you, you know the stent that you have in the heart.

PATIENT V469
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V469
If you don't take that it doesn't keep your blood thin and it can clog up again which means you can have another heart attack.

PATIENT V469
Oh.

DOCTOR V469
So that one you need to take every day and I guarantee it's not the one causing headaches.  There’s been no @@@.

PATIENT V469
It was kind of getting to the point where I didn't want to take any of them because I didn't know which one; you know I might take them if I could find out.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.  So how long have you not taken any of your medications?

PATIENT V469
Oh actually it's been about two, three weeks now.

DOCTOR V469
None of them, not even one of them?

PATIENT V469
No, like I said uh.

DOCTOR V469
Okay.

PATIENT V469
The headaches like migraines and @@@ instantly you know when I would cough.

DOCTOR V469
Hmm.

PATIENT V469
And so I didn't know which one so I didn't take any of them.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
I kept making appointments and missing them you know and stuff.

DOCTOR V469
Okay.  Can you describe the headaches or was it a migraine?

PATIENT V469
It was like a migraine.

DOCTOR V469
Can you tolerate light?

PATIENT V469
Uh.

DOCTOR V469
Is it worse when you look into the light?

PATIENT V469
Yes I think it was uh.  It would be instantly, thought @@@.  I figured it can't be all of the medications that was doing it but I didn't know which one.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.  Well this is what we can do.

PATIENT V469
Cause I just wouldn't take it you know.

DOCTOR V469
We can restart your medications but try them like two at a time.

PATIENT V469
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V469
So the Plavix, like I said, that is definitely not one that causes headaches.

PATIENT V469
No.

DOCTOR V469
There's no way that that would be causing your headaches.  So let's restart that one because that's the most dangerous to be off of.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

DOCTOR V469
Very dangerous @@@.

PATIENT V469
Well it's surprising to me that I had even had a heart attack you know and I know I had high blood pressure for a while.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.  Okay you had chest pain and everything too right?

PATIENT V469
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.

PATIENT V469
Cause it was surprising to him when I came in and the doctor said that uh.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.

PATIENT V469
That's what it was you know so.

DOCTOR V469
So there's many things that could predispose you to heart attacks.  One of them is having high cholesterol, which you do have.

PATIENT V469
Yes I do right.

DOCTOR V469
And another thing high blood pressure which you do have.

PATIENT V469
Right.

DOCTOR V469
One of them is smoking, do you smoke?

PATIENT V469
Well I have started back.  I had just about stopped and I started back somewhat and not as much as I was, but.

DOCTOR V469
How much do you smoke now?

PATIENT V469
Now I might smoke maybe a half a pack will last me about 2-3 days.

DOCTOR V469
Okay.  Do you drink alcohol?

PATIENT V469
No only on occasions.

DOCTOR V469
Okay.

PATIENT V469
Probably celebrations, something like that but that's it.  But also um like I told my last doctor I had here's the paperwork that I need redone.

DOCTOR V469
For?

PATIENT V469
Uh for my disability.

DOCTOR V469
What are you on disability for?

PATIENT V469
Uh @@@.

DOCTOR V469
So which one needs to be filled out?

PATIENT V469
If you could fill out the renewal @@@.  It has to be renewed @@@ on the car.

DOCTOR V469
Oh, you can't walk?

PATIENT V469
Well I can only walk so far.

DOCTOR V469
Okay how far can you walk?

PATIENT V469
Then my legs kind of give out on me.  @@@ it was a blockage @@@ blockage.  See in the emergency the doctors that treated me at the time had taken out @@@ go through my new doctor you know.

DOCTOR V469
Right.

PATIENT V469
You know so if you could do it now @@@.

DOCTOR V469
This is all fine but you need to take the medications.  I don't know how much to stress to you.

PATIENT V469
Yeah, I can go.

DOCTOR V469
How important this is, you could die easily.

PATIENT V469
@@@.

DOCTOR V469
You know how important it is to take this Plavix when you have a stent in your heart.

PATIENT V469
Okay.  And I was wondering too about the aspirin that was given to me the first time when I came too.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
And when I tried to get it renewed they said I had to come back to the doctor to renew it.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah, I'll renew all your medications.

PATIENT V469
Just for the aspirin, like I say aspirin was the lowest thing on the totem pole and I got to wait and come back to the doctor for aspirin.

DOCTOR V469
Well the only reason why is because these dose that they have you on.

PATIENT V469
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V469
They wanted you to take this dose for only one month and then they wanted you to come to me here. Which you didn’t do.

PATIENT V469
Right.

DOCTOR V469
And I'm supposed to put you on a lower dose cause you're only supposed to be on a high dose for one month after the heart attack.

PATIENT V469
Oh okay.

DOCTOR V469
That's why it was started.

PATIENT V469
And then the nurse was telling me something about that um like on the commercial where they have, they're talking about the blood pressure and uh some kind of cough syrup that you can take.

DOCTOR V469
A what?

PATIENT V469
Some type of cough syrup that you could take.

DOCTOR V469
I'm not sure.

PATIENT V469
No to override the headaches.

DOCTOR V469
Okay.

PATIENT V469
It had something to do with uh the headaches.  I don't know.

DOCTOR V469
A cough syrup for headaches?

PATIENT V469
Yeah it was a cough syrup.  I couldn't understand it either.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.

PATIENT V469
I couldn't understand it really cause before when I was taking the blood pressure pills I hadn't had headaches like that you know when I would take them you know.  

DOCTOR V469
Do you want it mailed to you or pick it up at the windows?

PATIENT V469
You know I could stop and pick it up at the window.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.

PATIENT V469
Aspirin.

DOCTOR V469
Today, uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
Yeah.  And also because you know I had surgery for my prostate you know, @@@.

DOCTOR V469
Yes.

PATIENT V469
And maybe, well I wanted to ask about uh @@@ the pump.

DOCTOR V469
To do what?

PATIENT V469
I wanted to ask about a prescription for the pump.

DOCTOR V469
The pump?

PATIENT V469
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V469
Uh we can get you a return visit with them.

PATIENT V469
Because see I was taking the pills.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.

PATIENT V469
But then I stopped taking the pills.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
And it seemed like the situation got a little worse after I had the surgery.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
So it was recommended @@@ maybe I could start a pump.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.

PATIENT V469
@@@.

DOCTOR V469
Well I'll have you follow up with the GU doctors so they can tell you; you know what to do to go about in getting it.  I know we don't have it here.

PATIENT V469
I thought they did cause they uh.

DOCTOR V469
Well, you can check with um.

PATIENT V469
Yeah cause the last time I was here they was talking about it at the Pharmacy.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.  Did they have the pump?

PATIENT V469
Yeah.

DOCTOR V469
Hmm.

PATIENT V469
@@@.

DOCTOR V469
Well I'll check for you, for sure.  Other things your blood pressure is way too high.

PATIENT V469
Maybe that's because I haven't took none of my medications in a minute.

DOCTOR V469
179/98.  So why don't we do this um why don't we start you back on two of your - your Plavix.

PATIENT V469
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V469
And one of your blood pressure medications and see if you can tolerate that.  If you can tolerate that we'll start back your cholesterol medications too and see if you can tolerate that.

PATIENT V469
Well that's just about the only one that I was somewhat taking was for my cholesterol.  I was kind of taking that to see now I'd stopped all my blood pressure pills you know.

DOCTOR V469
So what @@@ medications @@@ for you?

PATIENT V469
Well actually uh there's @@@ something else, I'm not sure.

DOCTOR V469
The metoprolol.

PATIENT V469
It's just because the last doctor that I had.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
He had changed them to suppertime for me because it was the affects that I was getting but still I actually found out it wasn't actually the pills, it was my prostate that was uh.

DOCTOR V469
It looks like yeah you were on the metoprolol but at a low dose and Captopril.  When you were on metoprolol before did you have headaches then?

PATIENT V469
No.  All this happened just after I had had the heart attack.

DOCTOR V469
Well we can try to decrease the dose of metoprolol.

PATIENT V469
Yeah.

DOCTOR V469
And see if that helps.  Right now you're on 200, every day, I'd say you can cut that in half and see if that helps.

PATIENT V469
Because it was really scary.  What's bothering me right now is I ain't got the energy for it, I would cough.  I would cough maybe once and instantly I’d get this headache, you know.  Cause man what is this you know and so I would you know the next day and I would take it and I would cough.  Just a little simple cough you know.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
And I'd say hey, it could be something else cause I haven't taken the blood pressure pills for quite a while.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
And then @@@ it was the quantity that I was taking, you know.

DOCTOR V469
Maybe cutting them in half might help.

PATIENT V469
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR V469
You can try that and the Plavix.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

DOCTOR V469
And the cholesterol medication too so you can at least start with those three and then you can start that fourth blood pressure medication if you're tolerating.

PATIENT V469
Uh-huh yeah.

DOCTOR V469
Okay.  And the aspirin you did not take you said.

PATIENT V469
No.

DOCTOR V469
Do you want to pick it up?

PATIENT V469
Well see I was dealing with the aspirins uh even before the heart attack.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
I just didn't take them on a regular basis like I was doing the aspirin, you know and it thins the blood so much you know.

DOCTOR V469
Right. @@@.  You had your cholesterol checked in August and at that time it was still high so I want to recheck it actually, it's been a while since you've – I’m sure it’s going @@@  Uh @@@.

PATIENT V469
I understand okay.

DOCTOR V469
Do you cholesterol on and off.

PATIENT V469
Now there's one thing that I discussed with DOCTOR you know I have this problem a lot of times with making my appointments @@@ and I don't seem to want to jump in fully @@@ problem, like it is now, with me not taking the medications because of the headaches, you know.

DOCTOR V469
What are the reasons that you don't want to come?  You don't feel bad or is it @@@.

PATIENT V469
Well no, there's always just something that pops up during that period of time, you know, that I need to do.

DOCTOR V469
What would make it easier for you to come?

PATIENT V469
Well now, you know since I have this problem with the headaches and I can't just not take them is I just need to come and find out what the problem is.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.  @@@ what's going on.

PATIENT V469
Yeah.

DOCTOR V469
You know with the high cholesterol, @@@ with it, heart attack with a stent and you don't feel it.

PATIENT V469
But that's really surprising because of the fact that I went so long with the high blood pressure if you noticed on my record, it's been a while and.

DOCTOR V469
And that's probably what made you, you know have the heart attack that and the smoking obviously.

PATIENT V469
Yeah.

DOCTOR V469
So @@@.

PATIENT V469
Yeah because at first I thought it was gas.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
@@@.  It just felt like it was moving, like I was telling my wife you know, oh it’s just gas you know.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
She said I don't know, you need to try to get that checked out you know so it continued throughout the day off and on you know.  So that's when I stopped @@@ find out exactly what it is you know and then I was surprised when the doctor told me that uh you know I might have missed one you know so.

DOCTOR V469
If there's one thing that I want you to promise me is that you will take your Plavix.

PATIENT V469
Right.

DOCTOR V469
Medication, your aspirin and at least one of your blood pressure medications and your cholesterol medication. That’s it.  Those are the one thing that I want you to.

PATIENT V469
Because I was doing all that when I first got home from the hospital you know I was taking them all every day and the first time I was @@@ but what set me back when I started getting the headaches you know.

DOCTOR V469
The headaches might not have been related @@@.

PATIENT V469
We'll see it was something that would happen, it didn't happen before.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
I was given the medications and then when I got out the hospital and I started taking the new medications it started.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
You know it just started that way and I guess it had to wait until my blood changed or whatever @@@.

DOCTOR V469
@@@ I wouldn’t @@@ medications.

PATIENT V469
Well.

DOCTOR V469
So now you're gonna be thinking it was the medications and you're not gonna want to take it.

PATIENT V469
Yeah.

DOCTOR V469
But we don't know for sure that's what it is.

PATIENT V469
Because you know when you, you know you think about the situation and think about what you have done before and what you have taken before and you didn't have this problem.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.

PATIENT V469
You know so you start having this problem, you said it has to be some that's related to the medication.

DOCTOR V469
But you were on that medication before, the metoprolol.

PATIENT V469
Uh not all the medications I was on, that I'm on now.

DOCTOR V469
No, not all of them, but you were on cholesterol pills which is in the same family as the lisinopril.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

DOCTOR V469
So they were in the same family and you were on metoprolol which is the same medication, just a higher does so we'll decrease it.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

DOCTOR V469
If that helps and the cholesterol medication seems like you're tolerating it.

PATIENT V469
Yeah.

DOCTOR V469
And the Plavix does not cause headaches, I’m telling you.

PATIENT V469
No.

DOCTOR V469
In my medical @@@ Plavix.

PATIENT V469
Okay it won't.

DOCTOR V469
I really, really encourage you.

PATIENT V469
You, try to find out exactly what it was, so it wasn't something that was happening, I have to do something, I'm doing now so maybe @@@.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
So something I came to the conclusion that it has to be the medication.

DOCTOR V469
Why don't we try it again on a lower dose then.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

DOCTOR V469
Um and then just start with the metoprolol at 150 mg, @@@ the aspirin, the Plavix and um the cholesterol medication the simvastatin okay.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

DOCTOR V469
Just those, that’s it, those four.

PATIENT V469
Because it's something about uh the situation just like when I was having the prostate problem, I tolerate the situation for a while.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
Until it gets to the place where I can't tolerate it anymore and that's when I get up off of my tail and go get it evaluated and checked out.

DOCTOR V469
Okay.

PATIENT V469
And with this here, I couldn't bear with constantly having these headaches.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.

PATIENT V469
You know throughout the day you know.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  75:11  DOCTOR IN:  80:51)

DOCTOR V469
Okay so I printed a copy out @@@ about the pump okay.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

DOCTOR V469
And then the medications that I want you to take, take this with you okay.  This one, which is for the blood thinner for the stent, this is important okay.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

DOCTOR V469
It is important. And then this one you can wait on.  This one I decreased to 100 only so that's probably will help the headaches okay and you can pick that up or you can just cut the pill you have at home in half.  Actually no, you can pick that up at the window and then this one wasn’t causing any problem so you can go ahead and take that, it's the cholesterol one.

PATIENT V469
Cholesterol one.

DOCTOR V469
And then the aspirin.

PATIENT V469
@@@ take this medication and see how it works but until I can do uh, @@@ the pump, can I start back on my pills?

DOCTOR V469
Yeah that should be fine absolutely.  It shouldn't be a problem I'll give you a prescription for it.

PATIENT V469
Okay.

DOCTOR V469
It probably will actually help with the blood pressure too.  Alright.  @@@ okay you better be taking these medications.

PATIENT V469
Yeah, I mean like I said the only reason, the only reason.

DOCTOR V469
@@@ useful.

PATIENT V469
The only reason why I hadn't taken or continued to take it is because I didn't know which one was giving me the headaches.

DOCTOR V469
The next time call.

PATIENT V469
Yeah.

DOCTOR V469
At least call.  If you don't want to come in.

PATIENT V469
Right.

DOCTOR V469
Then just call.

PATIENT V469
I didn't know that I could, I thought I had to schedule.

DOCTOR V469
Right.  So I'll give you the number and I'll talk with DOCTOR and that will help you @@@.  Don’t just, you know, don’t do anything.

PATIENT V469
So.

DOCTOR V469
@@@ lot of it too to make sure @@@ okay.

PATIENT V469
That's the same thing my wife said and has been constantly telling me that uh that it may be something that's entirely different @@@.  Really has changed my life.

DOCTOR V469
Uh-huh.

PATIENT V469
To the fullest you know and I can't.

DOCTOR V469
You're too young; you're too young to go okay.

PATIENT V469
Yeah.

DOCTOR V469
So take care of yourself.

PATIENT V469
That's why I'm here.

DOCTOR V469
I'm glad you came @@@.

PATIENT V469
@@@.

DOCTOR V469
You have to come here more regularly.

PATIENT V469
Yes I will, yeah I will, like I said I just um got certain things in front of it, at least my appointment would be, it would be on a day when something else that.

DOCTOR V469
Nothing's more important than your health.

PATIENT V469
Right.  Alright.

DOCTOR V469
Nothing.

PATIENT V469
Believe me, I get this told to me constantly with my wife you know.

DOCTOR V469
I know, I'm not trying to be naggy.

PATIENT V469
No it's great but you know, for me it has to be close because it's not, you know, like I did with my prostate all these years I waited @@@ I could have got the surgery a long time ago.

DOCTOR V469
Right.

PATIENT V469
But I kept putting it off, putting it off, putting it off and putting it off.

DOCTOR V469
Right.

PATIENT V469
Even waited until it got so serious I was going to the Emergency Room @@@.  So I got the @@@.

DOCTOR V469
You can't do that with this problem cause it'll kill you.  If it's gonna get worse it's gonna get worse I'm not gonna tell you @@@.

PATIENT V469
Right, right, right, right.

DOCTOR V469
It's different.

PATIENT V469
Okay doc.  @@@.

DOCTOR V469
@@@.

PATIENT V469
@@@.

DOCTOR V469
Yeah don't forget it.

PATIENT V469
I won't.

DOCTOR V469
Have a nice weekend.

PATIENT V469
Okay, thanks a lot now.
