PATIENT F948
I know it is, you know I knew @@@ my eyes is nothing, my nerves @@@.


DOCTOR F948
Yeah it's because you're not taking your water pills.  You're full of fluid.


PATIENT F948
Okay.


DOCTOR F948
For you your fluid dependent okay.

The more fluid you have on you, the higher your blood pressure is.


PATIENT F948

DOCTOR F948
Okay, you need to be on the water pill.


PATIENT F948
Well but where the fluid, I urinate the fluid out?


DOCTOR F948

DOCTOR F948
I know, that's because you have a lot on you.


PATIENT F948
Yeah okay.


DOCTOR F948
You gotta watch what you eat right?


PATIENT F948
Right.


DOCTOR F948
What you drinking.


PATIENT F948
Okay.


DOCTOR F948
If you're drinking too much, you've taken in too much salt, you're gonna retain all that fluid.


PATIENT F948
Okay.


DOCTOR F948
You have a tendency because your liver doesn't, isn't 100% you know.


PATIENT F948
Uh-huh.


DOCTOR F948
So you retain fluids, you have low protein probably, low albumin as they call it, low protein.  So you keep all that fluid in you.


PATIENT F948
Okay.


DOCTOR F948
So the water pill, you gotta be on it.


PATIENT F948
I know doctor, I keep.


DOCTOR F948
And I know you don't want to take it.


PATIENT F948
I keep saying, the same thing@.  But I've been so busy trying to like just get through the day, I tend of forget about it, just focus on the now with what I have to get done.  If I have to get a letter out, pay a bill or whatever.  The first of the month I go prepare things, go to the bank get the money, go to Cashay, get the money orders and then get around to pay the people.  Uh, so I'm just so focused doing that, if it's not an emergency I usually have a tendency not to put that high on the priority list.

DOCTOR F948
Let me see, okay here's your liver doctor.  I want to see what your liver doctor says.


PATIENT F948
He said he didn’t want to put me back on interferon.


DOCTOR F948
He said he wanted to?


PATIENT F948
He didn't and I was upset about that, somebody will kill me, I don't believe it.


DOCTOR F948
You're not a candidate um.


PATIENT F948
For a liver transplant.


DOCTOR F948
For a transplant because of the depression um.


PATIENT F948
So that you mean for the…


DOCTOR F948
No, no, no, not that um, cause you are not, you're intolerant to the interferon.


PATIENT F948
Right, right.


DOCTOR F948
So only on water pills and some Lactulose, he wanted to check your liver function twice a year.  He wanted to do an ultrasound.  He wants to do the endoscopy.


PATIENT F948
Okay, they did the ultrasound.


DOCTOR F948
Yeah and then he said um, for us to follow your Coumadin, which we did.


PATIENT F948
Okay.


DOCTOR F948
Um okay and then okay.  @@@.  Alright, let's see from my standpoint, what have I got to do for you.  So any ulcers on your leg, are all those healed up?


PATIENT F948

(DOCTOR OUT: 71:00)  (DOCTOR IN:  83:24)

DOCTOR F948
Hey we're gonna get a bone scan okay?  We're looking at some of the blood work.  We'll get you a bone scan.  Make sure all your bones are strong.


PATIENT F948
Okay, when you want me to do that?


DOCTOR F948
You can schedule it up front okay, say the doctor ordered a bone scan.


PATIENT F948
Oh okay.


DOCTOR F948
I want to see you again in three months.


PATIENT F948
Okay doc.


DOCTOR F948
Have you ever been checked for HIV?


PATIENT F948
Uh yeah right before my stroke, so back in 96, 96 maybe 96, cause I had the stroke in 97, February, so I know it wasn't that year.


DOCTOR F948
Okay.


PATIENT F948
So it was like the previous year.


DOCTOR F948
@@@ alright so, we're gonna restart the cholesterol medicine.


PATIENT F948
Okay.


DOCTOR F948
Alright sir.


PATIENT F948
Yeah, I have one more question doctor.


DOCTOR F948
Yeah.


PATIENT F948
I'm with this program, CWT Program here.


DOCTOR F948
Uh-huh.


PATIENT F948
And they are considering me working.


DOCTOR F948
Hmm, okay.


PATIENT F948
Is that, am I physically able to work?


DOCTOR F948
If you're getting Home Health, I don't know if that's a good idea, you know what I mean?


PATIENT F948
Right.


DOCTOR F948
If I fill out all these papers saying that you need.


PATIENT F948
Okay, okay.


DOCTOR F948
Uh disabled.


PATIENT F948
Okay ma'am, no problem.  I really want that.


DOCTOR F948
I'd get help when you need to.  Are you low on money?


PATIENT F948
No, no, it's just that I'm tired of just being in the house.


DOCTOR F948
Oh, okay.


PATIENT F948
All the time, was just for a while.


DOCTOR F948
Oh volunteering?


PATIENT F948
Well, well.


DOCTOR F948
What type of work are we talking about?


PATIENT F948
It's just scanning documents into a computer.


DOCTOR F948
Why don't you just go volunteer?


PATIENT F948
Well cause they're planning to do more volunteering than I do there and when I get no salary.


DOCTOR F948
Yeah, that’s true.  The VA @@@ takes good care of you @@@.


PATIENT F948
Right, well I get a special compensation cause I got two, I got two 100s really for the stroke and for the PTSD but it's just that I just want to do something with my life.  I'm not doing nothing just sitting and looking at the TV all day.

DOCTOR F948
Do you think uh, do you think volunteering would be more fruitful for you cause, cause volunteerism is a little bit more like you know you're donating your time.


PATIENT F948
I know but, but from what I understand the job description, I'm not, I would probably be doing less than if I volunteered.


DOCTOR F948
And they need a note from me?


PATIENT F948
No, no I was just asking your professional opinion.


DOCTOR F948
Well the thing is if you, you know if you feel that physically you're able to do it, I encourage you, you know, to be more active in your life and happy if you want to do it.


PATIENT F948
Right, well uh.

DOCTOR F948
But, like I don't want you to go and then be limited to be there, you know kind of fall backwards.


PATIENT F948
Well they, first my psychiatrist referred me to the program.


DOCTOR F948
Oh good, okay.


PATIENT F948
And and so.


DOCTOR F948
Yeah.


PATIENT F948
Then he signed off on it.


DOCTOR F948
But again you know, if you're having a hard time taking care of yourself around the house, I, I wonder how um, well you'll do this job, you know what I mean?


PATIENT F948
Yeah, right.


DOCTOR F948
You could try it.


PATIENT F948
Well we'll see, all, all the state could do is actually like, if somebody come out there, they don't do no vital signs or anything.


DOCTOR F948
Okay.


PATIENT F948
Or anything medical, they just want us come there and.


DOCTOR F948
Help you around the house.


PATIENT F948
Yes, I mean like go to the store for me.


DOCTOR F948
Why don't you try it out and if you seem to struggle with it, you know, you know yourself.


PATIENT F948
Right, okay.  Right, yeah okay, I think I could do it.


DOCTOR F948
But to be honest with you, I'd rather you concentrate on your medicines.


PATIENT F948
Okay, you're right.


DOCTOR F948
Okay.


PATIENT F948
Alright doc.


DOCTOR F948
Let me put in the bone scan.  You can go ahead and, do you need help getting out?


PATIENT F948
No I'm okay.


DOCTOR F948
Okay.  I'm gonna put in the bone scan and then.


PATIENT F948
So I just tell them at the check-out?


DOCTOR F948
Yes, yep, exactly.


PATIENT F948
Do want to give this form, this paperwork you gave me?


DOCTOR F948
That's in the folder book.


PATIENT F948
And then I can go pick up my meds sometime today?


DOCTOR F948

PATIENT F948
