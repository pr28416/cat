DOCTOR Q192
I have some other issues though but I know before we started you on the hydrochlorothiazide, the water pill.

PATIENT Q192
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q192
To help you with the blood pressure.  Have you been able to take that or just kind of put it off.

PATIENT Q192
I put it on the back burner and you know.

DOCTOR Q192
@@@.

PATIENT Q192
Yeah actually before that happened, the last time I came or whatever he said the blood pressure was uncontrolled.

DOCTOR Q192
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Q192
But today she took it, she saw; well you can see the note there.

DOCTOR Q192
Yes.

PATIENT Q192
It's high again or something.

DOCTOR Q192
I'll recheck it.

PATIENT Q192
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
But I mean that's not the biggest issue right now.

PATIENT Q192
Right.

DOCTOR Q192
I know you saw the dermatologist and they gave you that cream for the eczema, how's that?

PATIENT Q192
That be good. Refill.  Yeah you know.  @@@.

DOCTOR Q192
Okay.  Well um, yeah just call the Derm Clinic, I think they ought to see you again.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192 
@@@ you follow up in two months and that was in September but of course that.

PATIENT Q192
Right.

DOCTOR Q192
Everything happened with the uh shooting and what not.

PATIENT Q192
Right.

DOCTOR Q192
Um, other than that, anything else we need to address today?

PATIENT Q192
No, like I say it would be great if you could sign me up with someone to talk with a psychiatrist or whatever.

DOCTOR Q192
@@@.

PATIENT Q192
And also I'm thinking maybe some stuff to stop smoking.

DOCTOR Q192
Good.

PATIENT Q192
I want to stop smoking so.

DOCTOR Q192
How much are you smoking right now?

PATIENT Q192
Right now about five or six cigarettes a day you know.  Never got through a pack yet, but I five or six is enough.

DOCTOR Q192
Um you want to be put in the Smoking Cessation Clinic?

PATIENT Q192
No.

DOCTOR Q192
Because they actually have a special clinic and work with you a few times and help you to get your stuff together, to help you stop smoking.

PATIENT Q192
When is it and where is it, because transportation wise…

DOCTOR Q192
So it meets at different times, I don’t know exactly, it's headed up by the Social Work Department and @@@ some of it is actually you know over the phone, it's not like AA where you come in you know for meetings.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
Um then they can set you up with an initial appointment and then they can give you the medication.  There are nicotine patches and bupropion which is another medicine which ironically can help you with depression and help you increase your energy levels um to do a little bit better but um and that's gonna help stop smoking as well with the smoking cessation so.  Um I mean I can refer you to the Smoking Cessation Clinic and if it doesn't work for you logistically you don't have to come.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
That's totally fine.  

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
It's just what I would recommend since we have it that opportunity here.

PATIENT Q192
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
I think it’s worth it to you to explore if it’s all right with you.

PATIENT Q192
Yes, uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q192
Do it yes, cool.

PATIENT Q192
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
Um and uh any heavy alcohol use, drinking at home?

PATIENT Q192
Not heavy.  I do drink about a six-pack and a half a week.  @@@.

DOCTOR Q192
Okay.

PATIENT Q192
And it has not increased.  Actually it decreased a lot.  I haven't been drunk.  Just some beers yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
Okay.

PATIENT Q192
That's all, no heavy drinking.

DOCTOR Q192
And you're smoking how many cigarettes?

PATIENT Q192
About six a day.  Six or seven a day.

DOCTOR Q192
Now the only thing to be cautioned of is with the Norco or the pain medication that you're on, is one of the components is Tylenol and it clears through the liver.  Alcohol also gets cleared from the liver.  You shouldn't take them both together.

PATIENT Q192
No I don't, yes I know.

DOCTOR Q192
And because these can actually cause some liver damage and inflammation of the liver I don't want that to happen.

PATIENT Q192
Okay, yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
So I'd say if anything you know, until you start backing off the Vicodin or the Norco pain medication, I wouldn't drink.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
Um actually not to the critical level right now you know where you have to worry about extreme liver toxicity but nevertheless it could you cause some damage to your liver or some inflammation and I don’t think it’s worth it.

PATIENT Q192
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
But I mean I don’t mind your drinking, it’s safe if you weren't taking the pain medication.

PATIENT Q192
Right.

DOCTOR Q192
Cut ack if you can.

PATIENT Q192
That's cool, no problem.

DOCTOR Q192
Okay let me take a look at your lungs, just have a seat if you want to sit up here.  I'm gonna check your blood pressure.  A lots happened since the last time.

PATIENT Q192
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
Holy cow.  Deep breath.  @@@.

PATIENT Q192
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q192
Remind me, what did you do in the service?

PATIENT Q192
@@@.  On my right.

DOCTOR Q192
@@@.

PATIENT Q192
I'm like excused absences of course @@@ 

DOCTOR Q192
A little bit on the high side @@@ over 82.  And do you know if they gave you a tetanus shot?

PATIENT Q192
When it happened yes.

DOCTOR Q192
They did.

PATIENT Q192
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
Okay, what was the date of that?

PATIENT Q192
November 21st.  November 21st, that's when all that took place, I got a tetanus shot in the arm yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
Give me a couple of minutes; I'll be right back alright.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  50:47  DOCTOR IN:  58:04)

DOCTOR Q192
@@@.  

PATIENT Q192
@@@.

DOCTOR Q192
Well I'll tell you what, couple things.  It seems like you get all of  your pain medications from your outside doctors correct.

PATIENT Q192
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q192
Okay, I’ll let them follow up with that.

PATIENT Q192
Right.

DOCTOR Q192
Um but I did want you to get repeat labs today through us.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
And I want to check your liver function as well.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
Okay since you're on all that pain medication and @@@ the liver.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
And if you know, I just want to reiterated and like I said before with the alcohol and the pain medications both are cleared through the liver @@@ inflammation.  So that the @@@ liver function.  And next is the blood pressure, I think the reason @@@ pretty high is that because you have pain.

PATIENT Q192
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
Um and on top of that all the stress regarding anything that's going on with your leg and you had some hypertension or high blood pressure from before.

PATIENT Q192
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Q192
So I'd like to increase the dose of your high blood pressure medicine and I want you to start taking those @@@.  And in that regard we'll check the kidney function today and all your electrolytes cause this can kind of mess up your electrolytes um and then in about 2-4 weeks, at your convenience come back for a repeat blood pressure check with the nurse and repeat the lab making sure that everything is okay.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
Does that make sense?

PATIENT Q192
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
And then I'd like to see you in 2-3 months.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
Okay.  Is that cool to you?

PATIENT Q192
Uh-huh, yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
And I'll set you up with all those people.

PATIENT Q192
Cool, cool.

DOCTOR Q192
Just give me a second I'll order all these labs and what not.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
Do you want the blood pressure medicine sent through the mail?

PATIENT Q192
Yes do that.

DOCTOR Q192
Okay, then you don’t have to wait. And them you come back in about 2-4 weeks for a repeat of your labs.  Now I don't know when you can get in to see the psychiatrist or the psychologist uh it might be two, three, four weeks.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
I put in for them to see you a little bit sooner than more than two weeks.  I don't know if that works in their schedule.  If you have any problems or you can't get in for a long time, what I'd recommend you do is just go to the Mental Health Intake Center but I'm gonna write down the number for you okay.

PATIENT Q192
Yeah.

DOCTOR Q192
@@@.

PATIENT Q192
And this is for the lab?

DOCTOR Q192
Yeah all the labs are in.

PATIENT Q192
Okay.

DOCTOR Q192
You need some labs around the corner.

PATIENT Q192
Oh okay just around the corner here?

DOCTOR Q192
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT Q192
Okay cool.

DOCTOR Q192
And then come back in 2-3 months to see me and then 2-4 weeks to see the nurse for a repeat blood pressure check and you can stop up here in the clinic and also repeat for the labs to make sure your kidney functions @@@ bump of the dose of that blood pressure medicine.

PATIENT Q192
Okay will I just come or will it come in the mail?

DOCTOR Q192
Just come.

PATIENT Q192
Just come.

DOCTOR Q192
You just come anytime.  Like if you have an appointment with the Mental Health people.
