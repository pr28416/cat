DOCTOR A340
Yeah we can give you these.

PATIENT A340
Okay.  Cause those help my reflux.

DOCTOR A340
Reflux; let me put them in right now so I don't forget.  Did they give you anything at County for the vertigo?

PATIENT A340
Yeah they gave me @@@.

DOCTOR A340
@@@ yeah.  @@@ that's good @@@.  Yeah if you don't get dizzy you don't have to take them.

PATIENT A340
No right.  I don't take them unless @@@.  Yeah I had a history of vertigo before I had it real bad.

DOCTOR A340
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A340
This was a different case than what it was before.  Before the room had turned upside down.

DOCTOR A340
Right.

PATIENT A340
When I had it ten years ago.

DOCTOR A340
Uh-huh and now?

PATIENT A340
And now I get dizzy.

DOCTOR A340
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A340
I mean I was.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah vertigo is one of those @@@.

PATIENT A340
@@@ I walked with a cane for about a week.

DOCTOR A340
Well yeah, let me just @@@ um do you want to pick it up or do you want us to just mail it?

PATIENT A340
I can pick it up.

DOCTOR A340
Pick it up.

PATIENT A340
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A340
I'll put in 11 refills.

PATIENT A340
Okay.

DOCTOR A340
Okay.

PATIENT A340
@@@ let me know I got an appointment for the, did you see that in there uh, gastro - what is it?

DOCTOR A340
Yeah, gastroenterologist.

PATIENT A340
Yeah.

DOCTOR A340
They have this @@@ once a day.  You're supposed to take it twice a day.

PATIENT A340
No I only take it once.

DOCTOR A340
You only take it once that helps you?

PATIENT A340
It helps a little bit but it don't, it look like at the end of the day, cause I take it in the morning.

DOCTOR A340
Right.

PATIENT A340
So at the end of the day it’s starting to wear off.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah this is supposed to be twice a day so I'm gonna put it for twice a day.

PATIENT A340
Twice a day okay.

DOCTOR A340
Alright.  That's the only difference.

PATIENT A340
And I monitor it, you know.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah.

PATIENT A340
I’ll monitor it @@@ yeah if I don't need it twice.

DOCTOR A340
It only works if you take it all the time though.  Like even, like if you don't take it for a couple days then uh the acid-blocking like what it does.

PATIENT A340
Cut back.

DOCTOR A340
You have to start all over again.

PATIENT A340
Uh no, no, let me take it every day.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah and you're supposed to take it twice a day, try and take it every day.

PATIENT A340
Twice a day okay.

DOCTOR A340
Because it helps the most when you're lying in bed um.

PATIENT A340
Right.

DOCTOR A340
@@@ that’s the most important time to take it because the acid is going up your esophagus, cause you're lying down.

PATIENT A340
Yeah so the acid is running back up.

DOCTOR A340
Right so that's @@@.  Well I'm glad, the dizziness, the vertigo is such, everybody pretty much gets it, and all it is is that the inner ear.

PATIENT A340
Right.

DOCTOR A340
Did they explain it to you like what's going on?

PATIENT A340
No I thought it was coming from an infection.

DOCTOR A340
Oh not.

PATIENT A340
Not necessarily.

DOCTOR A340
Not necessarily.

PATIENT A340
Necessarily yeah.

DOCTOR A340
Some people get it from an infection but most people get it just when there are these little stones in both of our ears.

PATIENT A340
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A340
They tell our brains where we are like so right now you know you're sitting up.

PATIENT A340
Right.

DOCTOR A340
You know you're not laying down.  You know that because there are these stones in the ear that stay down.

PATIENT A340
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A340
Most of the time, when they are in the right place.

PATIENT A340
Right.

DOCTOR A340
And so we know that @@@ up but sometimes what happens, for no reason, the stones just kind of can get out of whack.

PATIENT A340
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A340
Like one of them will go up here or go down here somewhere.

PATIENT A340
Oh.

DOCTOR A340
And so then your brain gets confused and it's like well what's going on am I standing up, am I sitting down and just right or left.

PATIENT A340
Yeah.

DOCTOR A340
So you're kind of going in circles.

PATIENT A340
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A340
But usually this medicine kind of helps the brain to ignore the ears.

PATIENT A340
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A340
And so it tells it you know the ears messed up.

PATIENT A340
@@@ the other one is I got the vertigo.

DOCTOR A340
Oh the vertigo right, right, yeah definitely right.

PATIENT A340
Yeah.

DOCTOR A340
Uh so that's how that medicine helps and usually just with time, those stones just kind of get back in their place.

PATIENT A340
Okay.

DOCTOR A340
And then @@@.

PATIENT A340
Like @@@.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah.

PATIENT A340
You know you want to get out of the @@@.

DOCTOR A340
Exactly.  There are some exercises you can do to kind of help speed it along.

PATIENT A340
Okay.

DOCTOR A340
Did they teach you those?

PATIENT A340
No.

DOCTOR A340
No.  Let me show you, so basically what you do is @@@ first.

PATIENT A340
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A340
Um but then after the the stones, like so basically what you're doing is just kind of shaking everything up.

PATIENT A340
Yeah trying to get it.

DOCTOR A340
In the right place again. 

PATIENT A340
Yeah.

DOCTOR A340
So this is what you do, and then in the morning when you wake up you just kind of go like this and then you – you go slower than I’m doing it - you want to wait like 10 seconds.

PATIENT A340
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A340
And you go like this, I know it seems kind of silly but what you're doing is.

PATIENT A340
That's what I've been doing really, myself.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah and you just kind of do it three or four times and try to be a little bit slower than I'm going.

PATIENT A340
Yeah.

DOCTOR A340
And you just go like that, do that like in the morning and at bedtime

PATIENT A340
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A340
And do this, probably like 10 reps of that.

PATIENT A340
Yeah.

DOCTOR A340
And that should help.

PATIENT A340
Keep them on their side.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT A340
Staying in place.

DOCTOR A340
Right exactly.  So.

PATIENT A340
I didn't know, I thought maybe it was infection or something like that.

DOCTOR A340
Sometimes that can cause it too but this will mostly.

PATIENT A340
He said I don't have an infection.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah you can tell that just by looking in the ear if he looked in your ear.

PATIENT A340
He looked in it yeah.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah so he could tell so @@@.

PATIENT A340
But other than that I'm doing alright.  Just that acid reflex [sic] you know.

DOCTOR A340
@@@ check your labs @@@ labs done.

PATIENT A340
Right. @@@

DOCTOR A340
Very good @@@ problems @@@.

PATIENT A340
@@@.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah we can redraw them again today. They were all good las year. You see, there’s no abnormalities, your cholesterol was good, you kidneys are good, your liver is good.

PATIENT A340
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR A340
We'll get them redrawn today.

PATIENT A340
They did an x-ray on me in the Emergency Room hod did that come out.

DOCTOR A340
A chest x-ray?  Yeah I see it was normal.

PATIENT A340
Is it?

DOCTOR A340
Yeah.

PATIENT A340
Okay.

DOCTOR A340
@@@.  Your lungs are clear.  @@@.

PATIENT A340
Okay.

DOCTOR A340
It was normal.  That's good.  Let's see what else is here.  Okay are you still taking all these medicines that are on the list here?

PATIENT A340
Yeah.  The water pills and the @@@.

DOCTOR A340
@@@.  Yeah we'll @@@.  So you taking the Tylenol?

PATIENT A340
Not, unless I really need it.

DOCTOR A340
Just as needed.

PATIENT A340
Yeah.

DOCTOR A340
What about the acyclovir?

PATIENT A340
That's for the stomach is that what it is?

DOCTOR A340
No it's for the, uh for the herpes.  Do you have it?

PATIENT A340
No I didn't get those pills.  They put them in but they never came.

DOCTOR A340
They never came.  I'll put them in.

PATIENT A340
Actually when I went over there to uh get them.

DOCTOR A340
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A340
And I think I told them to mail them and they ain't never come.

DOCTOR A340
Oh uh I'll refill them for you.

PATIENT A340
Okay.  Now they gave me a inhaler.

DOCTOR A340
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A340
In the Emergency Room what do you think about that?

DOCTOR A340
For the oh because at that time you were having a cough.

PATIENT A340
Cause I had that real bad cough, @@@ that's another thing I had trouble with.  See when I got the cough, that’s probably what shook that stone up.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah.

PATIENT A340
Because I was coughing I couldn't stop, it was like the whooping cough.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah, that's probably what it, yeah.

PATIENT A340
And after I got rid of that then the acid reflex [sic] was a combination with the cough.

DOCTOR A340
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A340
And that's why they gave me the pills here and then @@@ that’s when vertigo hit that next week.

DOCTOR A340
That’s probably what it is.

PATIENT A340
Three weeks.

DOCTOR A340
Uh-huh.

PATIENT A340
For three weeks I was doing that.

DOCTOR A340
Yeah.

PATIENT A340
