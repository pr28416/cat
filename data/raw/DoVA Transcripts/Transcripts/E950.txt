DOCTOR E950
Good.  How you feeling, you okay?

PATIENT E950
Good.  Good to see you.

DOCTOR E950
Good to see you.  Everything you need.

PATIENT E950
Finally after all of another year is gone.

DOCTOR E950
Remind me how to say your last name?

PATIENT E950
PATIENT.

DOCTOR E950
PATIENT.  Alright.  Come on back and have a seat.

PATIENT E950
Sure.

DOCTOR E950
I can take your jacket if you like.

PATIENT E950
Oh I'll just leave it here on the chair.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
Because I got my cell phone in there and it falls out sometimes.

DOCTOR E950
Gotcha.

PATIENT E950
Yeah.

DOCTOR E950
Well how have you been?

PATIENT E950
Uh not too bad, not too good.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
One of the things that's really uh, a larger source of aggravation in the past.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Is my arthritis.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
I know that I was prescribed diclofenac I believe it is. 

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Uh the dosage is twice a day, I believe its 7.5 mg.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
I don't know if its enough and I don't if it's even the right drug.

DOCTOR E950
Right.

PATIENT E950
By the way I've run out of it, two days ago and they won't refill it downstairs because there's not a standing prescription.

DOCTOR E950
Hmm, yeah it's expired that's right.  So why do you think you don't know if it's the right drug.  Has it been helping enough with your pain?

PATIENT E950
It didn't.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
In fact I was in Emergency here about a month and a half ago.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
With severe pain.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And basically the doctor who attended to me at the time just said hey you know there's nothing more I can do.  He says you know, he was a sufferer as well.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
With back pain.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
He says you know there's nothing that even I can take for myself otherwise I'd give it to you but I think its two different conditions.  Ones arthritis, is there something else?

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
But you know, all the same uh basically I walked away with nothing.

DOCTOR E950
Okay and your pain is mostly in your back?

PATIENT E950
It's right above my right hip.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
And then it radiates all the way down, all the way down my thigh, all the way down the outer thigh.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Okay all the way down into my calf, up through my neck right to the base of the skull.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
It's like a ribbon.  I mean it literally feels like it's a hot ribbon.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
In my body.

DOCTOR E950
So you're having the pain, also it shoots all the way up your back to your neck or just through your neck?

PATIENT E950
It goes all the way up through my neck right to the base of the skull.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
Okay.  It's a very narrow.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Type feeling.  I don't know, it feels like somebody.  I don't know how else to describe it other than like it's a ribbon that's been heated up and just placed from my neck all the way down to my ankle.

DOCTOR E950
Okay and how long has it been getting worse for?

PATIENT E950
Uh probably a few months.  Ever since the episode with the TIA back in October.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.  Alright and anything make it better?

PATIENT E950
No nothing.  In fact, um.

DOCTOR E950
Is the.

PATIENT E950
I'll use Tylenol sometimes at night.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
When it's worse.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
And I only get about four hours of sleep till it wakes me up.

DOCTOR E950
Did the diclofenac.

PATIENT E950
Yeah.

DOCTOR E950
That's a mouthful, does that make it better?

PATIENT E950
Well that's what I was initially prescribed that medication after my TIA.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
By an outside physician.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
A physician that I had used for years.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
Um.

DOCTOR E950
Are you still seeing that outside physician?

PATIENT E950
No.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
No in fact I had to drop my Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance.

DOCTOR E950
Hmm, sorry to hear that.

PATIENT E950
Yeah uh well that's just the financial fact.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
Especially for myself and my wife.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
I maintained hers.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Because that's all I could afford.

DOCTOR E950
Okay so.

PATIENT E950
Uh but he switched me off the meloxicam.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
To go to that.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
I have been complaining of a lot more severe pain and he says okay, this is, you know this is a little more intense so maybe this will work.  Well it did work for a short period of time and now it's not working.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT E950
But I need something.  I mean its gotten way out of hand.

DOCTOR E950
Anything make the pain worse?

PATIENT E950
Yeah too much activity, especially with the pets.  You know I've been doing some work in the yard.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
You know trimming hedges and things like that.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
There's a lot of bending and stooping.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And that does aggravate it.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
Very much so but I can't not do that.

DOCTOR E950
Right.

PATIENT E950
Number one, I like it.

DOCTOR E950
Right.  Any other problems other than the pain that you've been having?

PATIENT E950
Uh no.  Uh I ran out of Plavix so I just went to baby aspirin.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
Uh they won't renew that.  There's a lot of the drugs they just won't renew them for me.  I don't know why I mean.

DOCTOR E950
So I never got, they usually send me an alert that uh you're out of meds and will I renew them for you.  So you called the Pharmacy and they just wouldn't renew them?

PATIENT E950
No I called the Pharmacy and they said oh you gotta come in so I made a trip in.  I talked to the pharmacist.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And he said oh there's not a prescription for it that's all, you got to get a prescription and so I made the appointment with you today because that's getting out of hand as well.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah I know. The neurologist wants you and I want you on the Plavix so I'm renewing that right now.

PATIENT E950
And uh another question that I've had.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And I meant to ask you the last time I was here, so actually two more questions uh.

DOCTOR E950
Do you want them to mail this or pick it up at the window?

PATIENT E950
I'm gonna pick it up at the window.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
You know because I'm out of it.  I mean I've got nothing.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
You know.  The other medication that I'm taking for diabetes is pravastatin.  

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh and that was actually for cholesterol.  Pravastatin?

PATIENT E950
Uh pravastatin is for cholesterol, correct I'm sorry.

DOCTOR E950
No that's alright.

PATIENT E950
Uh I read in uh, on a medical website.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
That's actually put up by one of the universities, Northwestern University puts it up.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Um that that statin drug should be considered uh for switching off of it for a time period.  I've been on it for five or six years.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And the article informed me to the point of saying that after about four years it's not a bad idea to talk to your physician and find out if you should be taken off of that and put on something else.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
So that's what I'm doing now.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.  Um are you, have you been taking them?  When was the last time you took the pravastatin?

PATIENT E950
Oh last night.

DOCTOR E950
So you still have some.

PATIENT E950
Oh yeah uh-huh.

DOCTOR E950
Let's look at your lipids panel.

PATIENT E950
Yeah that was the other thing.  I never got results back from the two tests that they did the last time.  The urine and the uh blood draws.

DOCTOR E950
Well let's look at these first and then we'll look at that.  So.

PATIENT E950
I can't see that you know.

DOCTOR E950
Oh okay.  So your LDL cholesterol which is the bad cholesterol is 105.  For you, you have a lot of risk factors.  You've already had one stroke or TIA.

PATIENT E950
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E950
So I think your goal should be more strict so less than 100 to even less than 70.

PATIENT E950
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E950
So I would say that your cholesterol is not well controlled yet.  So I would be hesitant to let you have a break from the statin.

PATIENT E950
Okay.

DOCTOR E950
When we don't even have your cholesterol under great control.

PATIENT E950
I understand okay.

DOCTOR E950
I mean if the article is very reasonable and that sometimes we just keeping pressing renew, renew, renew and then people have more and more meds and sometimes they needed one but now they don't um but.

PATIENT E950
Well that's exactly why I'm speaking to you about it.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah, no I think its important cause to make sure you really need what you're taking.

PATIENT E950
Right.

DOCTOR E950
Right.

PATIENT E950
Exactly.

DOCTOR E950
I think you do.

PATIENT E950
Okay.  No that's fine as long as your opinion is that, that's what we'll go with.  Um another thing that I wanted to bring up.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Is while I was still on Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Blue Cross/Blue Shield paid their part of my hospital bill.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Okay.  Now one of the reasons I wound up in the Elmhurst Hospital is because it was three minutes away from my home and I was having a stroke.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
I said I was a veteran and I had hospitalization here at the VA but they wouldn't drive me here.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
They just took me right there and started on me.

DOCTOR E950
Yep.

PATIENT E950
Um I spoke recently to a collection agency that I was turned over to because there was a nonpayment of $1500 on that bill.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And I said well, you know I've heard that the VA may take up a percentage of that which would lessen my cost.  I says number one I didn't even know I still owed you money.

DOCTOR E950
Right.

PATIENT E950
And the guy was very polite and very genuine as a human being.  He said well I'm gonna get you a detail of what the $1500 is going for.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
I want to know I owed Anesthesiology, was it you know Emergency Room, whatever.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And he said it could be just a bunch of combined things.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Where you know they got 80% from the insurance company on everything and then they just sort of reassessed it and said you know okay this adds up to this.

DOCTOR E950
Right.

PATIENT E950
Uh do you know the route that I have to take to inquire with the VA if they would pick up some of that?

DOCTOR E950
I do not, but I think uh maybe a social worker would be the place to start.

PATIENT E950
Okay.

DOCTOR E950
Alright but let me talk with my attending and see if he has a different idea.  If not we'll set you up with the social worker and see if she can point you in the right direction.

PATIENT E950
Yeah.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
That would be great.

DOCTOR E950
Alright.  I wanted to go over what meds you are still taking.  Like are you taking the Timolol for glaucoma?

PATIENT E950
I need that too.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
Thanks for bringing that up because I would've walked out of here forgetting.  Yeah I've got three or four drops left in the bottle.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
So about three or four days worth.

DOCTOR E950
And how about the metformin?

PATIENT E950
Metformin yes, I've been on that, that's my diabetes medicine. 

DOCTOR E950
Are you taking that currently?

PATIENT E950
I am.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
Twice a day.  I believe the total dose is 500 mg or about 1000.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah twice a day of the 500 for 1,000.  Um what about the Wellbutrin or the bupropion?

PATIENT E950
I need that.

DOCTOR E950
You need that.

PATIENT E950
Yes if you could do that.

DOCTOR E950
How is the depression doing?

PATIENT E950
Actually it's a very, very strange type of @@@.  Uh there's some days that I find myself crying over joyful things.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Uh but that's not depression.  I don't know what they call it.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
You know I it's, it's so bizarre.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
You know if I see something that I'm really happy about I just start crying.

DOCTOR E950
So maybe some emotional uh labile emotions.

PATIENT E950
Oh that could be you know I mean.

DOCTOR E950
That can happen with depression.

PATIENT E950
Yeah I'm not saying that uh you know I've had a horrible road to hoe.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
I've had a more difficult road to haul of late.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
You know losing my eyesight in 2009 and then you know my daughter's still a teenager, she's 19 and she moved to Florida.  Uh my wife's had two heart attacks.

DOCTOR E950
I know it's very tough.

PATIENT E950
And so you know I can see where I'd be a little pent up.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Legitimately I mean without making it some grander problem but as I was going into therapy uh I had to leave for Florida because my daughter fell into some really bad times there in Florida.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
So I left for Florida and I missed several appointments and when I got back I just never bothered to reappoint because what was being accomplished was very little um.  I think the psychologist wanted to, let's say take it from the beginning.  You know he wanted to try and delve into my life as from what I remember.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
All the way up to the present and so he of course is looking for triggers that might be going on now that relate to something in the past but I'll be very honest with you and I was very honest with him I says you know what, other than being in the military I've never had a traumatic experience.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
You know.  My mom was a stay-at-home mom.  My dad worked, he'd come home, we'd all eat dinner together.  I'd go out and play you know.  I mean I had such a normal childhood that it's not even funny.  It's just plain simple normal.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
You know and we were uh, we weren't impoverished, but we were definitely not middle class either you know we were just above impoverished.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
Okay.  Uh but that made no difference to me.  I mean I started working when I was 16 and anything that I wanted I bought.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
You know.  A couple times my mother had to sign for me; my dad had to sign for me like when I bought my first car.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And even though I had the money you still needed a co-signer at that time because of my age.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
So that was done but you know before the military there was no traumatic experiences.  In the military there was traumatic experiences but they weren't the type that uh, I don't feel like I have that syndrome.

DOCTOR E950
PTSD?

PATIENT E950
Yeah I don't feel I have that.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
I don't know.  I mean I think that's what this guy was trying to get after.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
And just maybe that was something going on to, I have no idea but I just sort of lost my interest.

DOCTOR E950
Alright well.

PATIENT E950
Seriously.

DOCTOR E950
You know I'd encourage you that uh you keep up with the Mental Health okay, if you need it um and maybe if there's someone else that you can see.  But definitely if you're getting crying more, losing interest in activities, lack of appetite, can't sleep, any of those symptoms, let us know okay.

PATIENT E950
Yeah.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.  I'm gonna take a look in your eyes.

PATIENT E950
@@@.

DOCTOR E950
They're good.

PATIENT E950
You're not going to very successful on it.

DOCTOR E950
Hmm, there's a little @@@ that's alright.  Um.

PATIENT E950
Most people can't see my pupils anyway that's why I.

DOCTOR E950
I know.

PATIENT E950
My eyes just sort of.

DOCTOR E950
Are you still smoking?

PATIENT E950
Yeah.

DOCTOR E950
Any interest in quitting?

PATIENT E950
There's always an interest in quitting.  It seems as though my interest wanes.  I had actually physically stopped for a week.

DOCTOR E950
That's good.

PATIENT E950
Um and that's exactly when I started the uh generic Wellbutrin.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
You know it helped a lot.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
Suppress the urge.

DOCTOR E950
It does uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Uh but then all these things started to break loose of course.  You know this always happens.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
Um my daughter got all crazy in Florida and I went out there and she's a heavy smoker.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And the person that she's living with a heavy smoker so I just, go right back up.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
By the time I got home six weeks later I was smoking again.

DOCTOR E950
Well you know what my advice is gonna be right?

PATIENT E950
Well of course I do.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.  And what I'm saying alright.  Deep breath in, good again.  Alright excellent.

PATIENT E950
Yeah and it's really funny because I think the, probably the biggest psychological issue with smoking.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And I have this every battery of test that I've had one on since October 4th of last year.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Certainly would've brought out even the slightest little defect in the lung capacity, in the heart, carotid artery.  I mean they did everything and it all came back great.  And it's that, my attending physician at the hospital said that he couldn't believe the condition I was in internally for what I'm doing to myself.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
So she says it's luck.

DOCTOR E950
Well I wouldn't take the risk.

PATIENT E950
I know there's always a shot there that's gonna.

DOCTOR E950
Alright.

PATIENT E950
Jump up and grab you.

DOCTOR E950
Well I'd like to get some lab work on you.

PATIENT E950
@@@.

DOCTOR E950
At your convenience.  Did you get some today?

PATIENT E950
No not today.

DOCTOR E950
No.

PATIENT E950
But uh again the lab work that was performed the first time I thought we were going to meet which was all the way back last year.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Um you did say see you in three months or because I came in October so I scheduled an appointment and then I came in and @@@.

DOCTOR E950
No.

PATIENT E950
And so but I never got results over the phone either.  All of the lab that they did at that time was probably back in November.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Maybe December.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.  Well I've looked over your labs.  It's hard for me to get back to those exact ones.

PATIENT E950
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E950
Um but I want to redo some lab tests again today.  It looks like liver function hasn't been done in almost a year.  Uh and you @@@ and your lipid profile your creatinine we'll pick up and look at, something like your electrolytes and kidney function.

PATIENT E950
Okay well now that the weather's broken up and what it is, I'm gonna start walking again.  I don't know if I told you but I was walking on an average of six miles a day.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And I had actually taken down 15 pounds.

DOCTOR E950
That would be very good.

PATIENT E950
Yeah.  I just got to restart now cause everything's south.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.  I know you can do it. It will be good.

PATIENT E950
Yes it’s my nature @@@ down the line.  Like that one @@@ very light.  One reason why I want to lose weight.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
And I didn't have a girlfriend and gained weight.

DOCTOR E950
Not @@@.  Well let me go talk with my attending.

PATIENT E950
Alright.

DOCTOR E950
And we'll talk about what uh, what to do for this pain okay.

PATIENT E950
Sure.

DOCTOR E950
Alright.

PATIENT E950
Okay.

DOCTOR E950
See you back in just a few minutes.

PATIENT E950
Okay.  If he doesn't have any other suggestions you know the diclofenac would just have to be.

DOCTOR E950
Trust me, we've got a few more things we can try.

PATIENT E950
Good, as long they're not nonsteroidal.

DOCTOR E950
They are not steroids.

PATIENT E950
Okay.

DOCTOR E950
@@@.

PATIENT E950
Cool.

(DOCTOR OUT:  35:19  DOCTOR IN:  39:33)

DOCTOR E950
Alright.  So we're gonna try a medicine called tramadol.

PATIENT E950
Okay.

DOCTOR E950
It's um a medicine that, it's a little bit stronger.

PATIENT E950
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E950
But it's not a narcotic.

PATIENT E950
Good.

DOCTOR E950
And it's not an NSAID and it's not uh a steroid.  It's just kind of it's only little.

PATIENT E950
Only little creature.

DOCTOR E950
Own little niche.

PATIENT E950
Okay.  Well that's fine.  As long as it's not a steroid or a narcotic I'll take it.

DOCTOR E950
Okay.

PATIENT E950
I would have a debate with you otherwise.

DOCTOR E950
Sounds good.

PATIENT E950
Such as, if I'm suffering from depression and you really think I need a narcotic in my body, no.

DOCTOR E950
Agreed and talking with my attending he would like to get you established the Eye Clinic since I can't monitor the pressures in your eyes.

PATIENT E950
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E950
I'm not refilling the Timolol for you okay.

PATIENT E950
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR E950
So uh I'm gonna have, refer that to the ophthalmologist, that way they can monitor it okay.

PATIENT E950
Sure.

DOCTOR E950
And then I'm gonna put in a consult to the social worker.

PATIENT E950
Okay.

DOCTOR E950
And you should get a phone call about telling them, what you can talk to them about.

PATIENT E950
Okay is that.

DOCTOR E950
The medical bills.

PATIENT E950
That's good.  Because it just comes out @@@.

DOCTOR E950
Uh-huh.

PATIENT E950
Yeah again.  Had I been transported here.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
Uh, you know if it was something else.  Let's say I slipped and fell and broke my hip and they take me to the hospital well they would have brought me here but because of a stroke.  I guess they're directed to take you to the nearest facility.

DOCTOR E950
They are.

PATIENT E950
And since I live a mile exactly from Elmhurst Hospital.

DOCTOR E950
Alright.

PATIENT E950
Now these prescriptions now will be available downstairs?

DOCTOR E950
Yes.

PATIENT E950
And they're right?

DOCTOR E950
I hope.  We'll see you again in six months.

PATIENT E950
Are you gonna be here six months from now?

DOCTOR E950
Yep.

PATIENT E950
Okay.

DOCTOR E950
I'll be here for two more years.

PATIENT E950
Oh really.

DOCTOR E950
Yep.

PATIENT E950
Oh wow.  I must have been on the back end of the last doctor's.

DOCTOR E950
Yep.

PATIENT E950
Run.

DOCTOR E950
Run, yeah.  Alright oh and then the other thing for the pain I think, would you be willing to do physical therapy?

PATIENT E950
I would be willing to.  I don't know if it's going to do anything but I'd be willing to sure.  

DOCTOR E950
Let's do a trial of that and see if that helps you.

PATIENT E950
Yeah, why not?  I mean anything that'll help is well worth it.

DOCTOR E950
I like the attitude.

PATIENT E950
Yeah physical therapy, well yeah you know the physical therapy I was basically doing my own all my life until I had a baby.  My wife slimmed down and I just kept picking up.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
Once the baby was born, that was it, I don't know.  Cause I was working 16 hours a day most of the time and.

DOCTOR E950
It's hard isn't it?

PATIENT E950
Oh yeah.  And I was in upper level management so you know I was sitting on my butt for 14-16 hours every day.

DOCTOR E950
Yeah.

PATIENT E950
And I was eating junk food like it was going out of style.

DOCTOR E950
That'll do it.

PATIENT E950
Yeah.

DOCTOR E950
Do it for you won't it.

PATIENT E950
Yeah cause I was a body builder for many years.

DOCTOR E950
Oh yeah.

PATIENT E950
It was more of a hobby but still.  I was in superb shape.

DOCTOR E950
Right, they should be calling you with this physical therapy appointment.

PATIENT E950
Okay so I got two calls to look forward to.

DOCTOR E950
Yep.

PATIENT E950
Alrighty, that sounds good.

DOCTOR E950
And lab work to do at your convenience.

PATIENT E950
Okay.

DOCTOR E950
And we'll be sure to send you a letter this time.

PATIENT E950
Okay.  So I think what I'll do is when I get a phone call from either of those two entities and they establish an appointment with me I'll just do my labs on the day of the appointment with them.

DOCTOR E950
That sounds like a plan.

PATIENT E950
And eat at the Commissary and do that.

DOCTOR E950
That sounds good.

PATIENT E950
Yeah, that's how I'll work it.

DOCTOR E950
Great.

PATIENT E950
Alright doctor, well I thank you very much.

DOCTOR E950
Good to see you again.

PATIENT E950
Good to see you and you have a great day.

DOCTOR E950
