Hi.

DOCTOR H199
It’s high! Aw come on, you know @@@ blood pressure.

PATIENT H199
Okay.

DOCTOR H199
Have you been taking your medicines?


PATIENT H199
Yeah.


DOCTOR H199
Did you take them today?


PATIENT H199
Yes.


DOCTOR H199
Oh.  You look like you've gained some weight.


PATIENT H199
Maybe just.


DOCTOR H199
You look fuller in the face.


PATIENT H199
Yeah?


DOCTOR H199
Yeah.  Let me look at your legs today.  Oh your legs they look good.  I was worried @@@.  Now you look okay. They look the same.  Maybe it's just me, seeing things.  You're okay.  What's up, what's new?


PATIENT H199
Not much.


DOCTOR H199
Nothing?  So you're taking your medicines for sure?


PATIENT H199
Yes.


DOCTOR H199
Oh.  So your weight from the last year.  Yeah I know you were trying to get down to 170 pounds, so that's up good.  Let me recheck your blood pressure.  Can you take off your jacket for me?  Okay, crawl up here.  Anything new at home?

PATIENT H199
No.  I guess that's the main thing.


DOCTOR H199
Do you have family coming here?  How many pills do you take for your blood pressure a day?


PATIENT H199
One.


DOCTOR H199
Supposed to be taking two, maybe that's why.  Did you run out of one?  You're supposed to be on . . .


PATIENT H199
Lisinopril.


DOCTOR H199
I might have just stopped one of your pills cause your blood pressure was low last time?  No?  Now your blood pressure has been high.  I want to know what happened.  You're supposed to be on two of them.

PATIENT H199
The one I take is refillable.


DOCTOR H199
Okay.  That is not as bad.  Let me take it on the other arm.  Any headaches, weakness, vision changes or anything like that?

PATIENT H199
Nope.


DOCTOR H199
Okay.  So they used to have you on uh two pills.


PATIENT H199
Yeah.


DOCTOR H199
And then I guess they took one of them off probably because you were low and you were dizzy too.  But, if you're, if it's really this high again I might have to start a new one.  Just relax your arm, relax it.  Cause actually that hydrochlorothiazide they now have a combo pill so I can give you one now that has a combination of two so, maybe that's a good option.  Okay.  Not bad.  Not as bad as too low yeah, better than.  Have you been eating high salt food or anything?  Let’s see, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs.  High salt foods or anything like that?
