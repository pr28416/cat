PATIENT G244
Once a day.

Usually I take it with the pills.

DOCTOR G244
Uh-huh.

PATIENT G244
Then I'll be fine.

DOCTOR G244
Yeah okay.  Okay um.  I'm going to make some notes; I'm going to put them in here.  Um okay, let's see alright so the other thing that sometimes we try for nerve pain like neuropathy.

PATIENT G244
Yeah.

DOCTOR G244
Is some medicine called gabapentin.  Have you ever tried that before?  It's a pill that you take three times a day and usually we start at the low dose and then increase it as you tolerate it um and it's supposed to help with nerve pain.  Um some people it helps, some people it doesn't.  I don't really know, you know we have no way of identifying who it would.  Would you want to try that?

PATIENT G244
Okay.  You gave me; a doctor gave me some type of salve.

DOCTOR G244
Oh some what?

PATIENT G244
Capsaicin.

DOCTOR G244
Oh some cream?

PATIENT G244
Yes.

DOCTOR G244
Okay.

PATIENT G244
A type of cream.

DOCTOR G244
Yeah, yeah, okay.

PATIENT G244
That @@@.

DOCTOR G244
Did that help?  Have you been trying it?

PATIENT G244
I haven’t tried it.

DOCTOR G244
Oh okay, okay.  Yeah cause that stuff can help too with the neuropathy.

PATIENT G244
Really?

DOCTOR G244
Yeah definitely.  Everyone's different.  Some patients really like the cream, some people really like you know the gabapentin, it's a little bit different for everybody.   Do you want to try that first and if it doesn't work then we'll try the pills or do you want?

PATIENT G244
Yeah.

DOCTOR G244
Yeah let's do that.  You're on enough meds right now, so we'll just take it slow okay.  Um so it sounds like it's pretty painful so I don't want to like ignore it though.  Okay and then the other thing is the urination stuff.  You're going, so you're peeing a lot, what's the story?

PATIENT G244
Uh-huh.  @@@ I drink a lot of coffee.

DOCTOR G244
Uh-huh, sure.  Uh how many times a night do you have to get up and use the bathroom?

PATIENT G244
About three or four.

DOCTOR G244
Three or four times a night.  That's interrupting your sleep isn't it?

PATIENT G244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G244
Yeah um and uh have you noticed that there's any change in the strength of the stream?

PATIENT G244
No.

DOCTOR G244

PATIENT G244
No changes.

DOCTOR G244
Are you still, is it that you have to go and pee do you have to wait a while for it to start?

PATIENT G244

DOCTOR G244
So it's just peeing frequently.

PATIENT G244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G244
Any pain when you urinate?

PATIENT G244
No.

DOCTOR G244
No pain, that's good, that's good.  Um okay.  And yeah I mean definitely you're getting to the age where prostates do start interfering with men and so that's something we can take a look into.  Um okay.  Let's see alright okay.  Anything else bothering you?

PATIENT G244

DOCTOR G244

I'm going to ask you gentlemen to step outside.  Um you can wait in the hallway or in the waiting area either one and um I'll uh call you back when we're done.

PATIENT G244
Sit here?

DOCTOR G244
Yeah.  So I really want to check your prostate?   Have you had that done before?

PATIENT G244
No.

DOCTOR G244
It's really not pleasant.

PATIENT G244
@@@.

DOCTOR G244
What we do is uh I put, I put a finger in your rectum and feel your prostate.

PATIENT G244
Oh.  I had that done; I had that done in the Army.

DOCTOR G244
Oh yeah, you've had them before, you know what it's like.  The main thing about it is that I can feel your prostate and I can feel if there are any lumps or bumps, I can feel if it's bigger than normal.

PATIENT G244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G244
Um and it's something we should probably do so we'll do it now, sounds like you haven’t had it for a while, so that'll be good.  So it'll take only a second.  @@@.  Okay.  Alright.  So we'll start with the prostate exam.

PATIENT G244
@@@ Agent Orange.  @@@ prostate @@@.

DOCTOR G244

PATIENT G244

DOCTOR G244

PATIENT G244
Yep.

DOCTOR G244
Okay.  Uh I just need you to drop your pants and turn around and face that way and lean forward okay.

PATIENT G244
Okay.  Right here.

DOCTOR G244
Okay now turn around over there, can you face the wall for me, that'll be good yeah.  There we go.  Okay.  Alright.  So if you lean forward a little bit, perfect.  Okay so you're gonna feel me spreading your cheeks with the outside and then you'll feel a cold finger okay.  Well yeah okay alright good.  All done.  I'm gonna come back @@@ so you can go ahead and clean up.  I'll be right back in okay.

PATIENT G244
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  45:17  DOCTOR IN:  46:40)

PATIENT G244
Oh.

DOCTOR G244
Did you hurt at all @@@.

PATIENT G244
@@@.

DOCTOR G244
Okay so uh basically, it didn't feel too crazy back there.

PATIENT G244
Hmm.

DOCTOR G244
That's the good news um yeah so I think that uh, you the prostate might be a little bit big uh but I didn't feel any lumps or bumps so that's good.  That means you know probably less likely  chance.

PATIENT G244
Of prostate cancer.

DOCTOR G244
Of a cancer yeah.  We can also do a blood test to look for cancer, it's uh not 100% test so sometimes it comes back low and people still have it.  Sometimes it comes back high and people don't have it but usually if it comes back high we like to investigate more.  Um we need to just send people to the urologist.  So is it okay if we check that blood test on you?

PATIENT G244
Today?

DOCTOR G244
Uh-huh, yeah well if we do blood we're able to do it today.

PATIENT G244
Okay.

DOCTOR G244
Okay, okay.  Um everything else.

PATIENT G244
They always have problems getting my blood.

DOCTOR G244
They always have problems getting your blood?

PATIENT G244
Hmm.

DOCTOR G244
You're a hard stick.  We should give you and make you drink a bunch of water so your veins get all pumped up.  Yeah I know.  Everyone has their cross to bear, you got to @@@.

PATIENT G244
One guy he's no good at all and the other guy he's no good.

DOCTOR G244
Yeah.

PATIENT G244
But the young lady she always has problems.

DOCTOR G244
Okay.  Maybe you should try and get the guy.

PATIENT G244
@@@.  Okay.

DOCTOR G244
Maybe she just hasn't been doing it as long.  Is she younger? Maybe she'@@@ good job.

PATIENT G244
I gotta do something.

DOCTOR G244
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT G244
Do I go give blood right here?

DOCTOR G244
Yeah, let me just double check everything else so um yeah.  So we'll recheck a prostate test and then we'll check again your A1c level, that's to check how your diabetes is doing.  Um I think that we were good on um your cholesterol um so we were dealing with that with the pharmacist, so I don't know if we need to check that but um we'll see about that and then the other things is, so we're not gonna start the medicine for the nerves cause you're gonna try the stuff the podiatrist gave you.

PATIENT G244
Uh-huh.  @@@ type of thing.

DOCTOR G244
Yeah, yeah.  Try that stuff and if that works then we won't bother with the gabapentin.  If it doesn't work, at your next visit, we'll try the gabapentin okay.

PATIENT G244
Okay.

DOCTOR G244
Then we're not trying like six things at once and we'll know what's working and what isn't.  Um and then did you get your flu shot this year?

PATIENT G244
No.

DOCTOR G244
No okay well, it’s almost the end of flu season now.  Uh okay and then the um other thing we want to double check on is the uh the urination stuff.  So we can start medicine for that um you know that helps with the prostate.

PATIENT G244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G244
Um it might help you and so we might consider trying that, what do you think?

PATIENT G244
Okay.

DOCTOR G244
Yeah.  I think it would be nice if you didn't have to get up so many times at night you know.  I don't think it's just that you're drinking a lot of water cause you've probably been doing that through the years you know and it's more recently that this stuff has been coming up.  So why don't we try, we'll start that medicine.  Uh usually we start that medicine at a low dose and then we increase it over time okay.  I’ll give it to you in a starter pack and it'll say how to take it like 1 mg one week and 2 the next and so forth okay. Uh okay and then you want to, um providing you know the labs return normal, we'll have you come back in like three, four months.

PATIENT G244
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR G244
Um come back sooner if you need to, like if the salve doesn't work on your leg.

PATIENT G244
I'll be back on the 23rd.

DOCTOR G244
Oh the 23rd, for the Red Clinic?

PATIENT G244
No the Agent Orange Clinic.

DOCTOR G244
Oh okay, okay.

PATIENT G244
The @@@.

DOCTOR G244
Yeah.  If you are not, if the salve isn't working on your foot you know, then come back and make an appointment to see us earlier.

PATIENT G244
Okay.

DOCTOR G244
Come back and see me in like April or May.

PATIENT G244
Well I did, I made an appointment to see you.

DOCTOR G244
Oh okay.

PATIENT G244

DOCTOR G244
Yeah, yeah, no I'm glad.  I'm glad you came back.  Okay um I'll go put the lab, I'll put the lab work in and have you go over to the blood Lab but you know DOCTOR wants to see you first.  So let me go get her.  You guys sit tight and I'll be right back.  Okay.  That's good alright, thanks.

(DOCTOR OUT:  51:09  DOCTOR IN:  59:45)

SECOND DOCTOR G244
Hi.  You have a lot of friends with you, all family with you.

PATIENT G244
Yeah, uh-huh.

SECOND DOCTOR G244
@@@.  Okay PATIENT how are you?  Greetings.

PATIENT G244
I think I'll be alright.

SECOND DOCTOR G244
Two things um, the cholesterol medicine you're not taking any more so I don't know if you have the bottle at home or you ran out or what.

PATIENT G244
I think I ran out.  I called them about it.

SECOND DOCTOR G244
No we need to put the order in, so we're going to put the order in.  Um so but the cholesterol was pretty high last time it was checked so once you started taking it, it takes a couple of months to come back down so you do need to come and see our Pharmacy doctor in two months to make sure that its working and your cholesterol is down okay.

PATIENT G244
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR G244
Alright and then the other issues you already talked with DOCTOR.

FIRST DOCTOR G244
Okay, okay.  Thanks DOCTOR.  Oh okay.  So we're gonna do a few things today.  We're gonna do the blood work.

PATIENT G244
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR G244
Um we're gonna have you schedule an appointment um for two months um with the Pharm D and you know that's here in Red Clinic.  Have you seen her before in the Pharm D?

PATIENT G244
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR G244
Okay.  Um and that's just a follow-up on your cholesterol.  The clerk will make that appointment um.  But you have to stop and tell her to make it.

PATIENT G244
Okay.

DOCTOR G244
And then go to the lab to do the blood work and then um we're gonna restart the cholesterol medicine.  Do you want to pick them up at the Pharmacy or do you want us to mail it to you?

PATIENT G244
They can mail it to me.

FIRST DOCTOR G244
Mail it to you okay.  So we're gonna mail you.

PATIENT G244
I called in for that and they told me it was on the way.

FIRST DOCTOR G244
Oh never came huh.

PATIENT G244
No.

DOCTOR G244
I'm sorry about that.  It might be our fault that we didn't reorder enough of it or something you know and maybe it wasn't in there so we're gonna be putting you back on the same thing you were on simvastatin 80 mg each night and um then the other thing we're gonna mail you is the medicine for the prostate to see if that helps.

PATIENT G244
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR G244
And that's called tamsulosin.  There's actually two medicines that we can use for the prostate, I don't know, you know if you've seen the commercials for them.  But one of them also can lower your blood pressure so we're not starting that one because your blood pressure's already good you know.

PATIENT G244
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR G244
So um, so usually you use those daily, I that'll do it so, triple check, yeah at bedtime so we'll start you on @@@.  Okay.  Alright, so here's the plan.  Appointment with the Pharmacy in uh two months, make that appointment today, go to the Lab and give blood and then we'll mail you those medicines and start taking them okay.

PATIENT G244
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR G244
And then you'll come back and see us in the clinic in like three or four months.  We'll mail you a letter.  Um and to let you know I'm graduating so I won't be here after May.

PATIENT G244

FIRST DOCTOR G244

PATIENT G244

FIRST DOCTOR G244
But you'll have someone new, so maybe an intern.  You know be nice to them, they’re scared, they're new.

PATIENT G244
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR G244
