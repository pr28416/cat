PATIENT O905
Double a 10?

DOCTOR O905
Well it's 11.

PATIENT O905
Oh okay.

DOCTOR O905
Because it should be less than 6.

PATIENT O905
Right.  I had got it down to 7.3.

DOCTOR O905
Yeah.

PATIENT O905
When I was doing really well, cause it was like 10 1/2 and I got it down to 7.

DOCTOR O905
Well let me have you sit up here and um do an exam.

PATIENT O905
Yeah.

DOCTOR O905
Deep breath.  Let me see your scar, any problems?  

PATIENT O905
Well it's kind of sore right here.  Cause there's one time when I was gaining weight back I thought they had opened a vein up.

DOCTOR O905
Oh, pardon.  I think it feels fine, I'm not feeling a hernia or anything like that.

PATIENT O905
Yeah.  I'm talking about down here.  At one time it was hurting for like a week.

DOCTOR O905
Uh-huh.

PATIENT O905
And I thought I'd stretched the stomach thing and it was supposed to be permanently little.

DOCTOR O905
Oh okay.  Um okay so I think as far as I think our main problems today are the diabetes and the blood pressure.  So we're gonna restart some medications which I'm gonna discuss with DOCTOR.  As far as just health screening type of stuff, I know you had a colonoscopy a few years ago.

PATIENT O905
Yes.

DOCTOR O905
So you're not due for that for eight more years.  You're fine.

PATIENT O905
Yeah.

DOCTOR O905
Um we could check a PSA today um otherwise you just had all your other blood work.

PATIENT O905
Right.

DOCTOR O905
I might, your one cholesterol number which we usually start medications for it looks okay but your triglycerides are really high.

PATIENT O905
Okay.  How.

DOCTOR O905
We don't like that, 473.

PATIENT O905
Okay.

DOCTOR O905
It's supposed to be below 150.

PATIENT O905
I know, I know.

DOCTOR O905
So I might um.

PATIENT O905
But at one time it was 1100.

DOCTOR O905
Oh.  Do you have a family history of that?

PATIENT O905
Yeah I think so.  The other one is on cholesterol medicine.

DOCTOR O905
Or do you want to go on fenofibrate?

PATIENT O905
I don’t know what that was?

DOCTOR O905
I think I'm probably going to start you on that.  It's a medicine that mostly just works on the triglycerides.

PATIENT O905
Okay.

DOCTOR O905
But otherwise.

PATIENT O905
I know I got it from 1100 to 100 some, I was shocked.  It took about four months but.

DOCTOR O905
Well I'm gonna go talk with DOCTOR about all this and otherwise we'll, I'll get you to see somebody about that MOVE Program, the Diabetes Program.

PATIENT O905
Okay.

DOCTOR O905

DOCTOR O905
