PATIENT K515
Okay thank you.

DOCTOR K515
Um.

PATIENT K515
And we're being recorded okay.

DOCTOR K515
Oh okay.  Do you record all your visits?

PATIENT K515
No it's just that some program is going on I guess DOCTOR agreed to it so since he's not here.

DOCTOR K515
Oh okay.  Um I know what you're referring to.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
So now I'm part of it as well.

PATIENT K515
Okay good.  So we're okay with that?

DOCTOR K515
Yeah sure.

PATIENT K515
Good.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.  How are things going since you're last visit?

PATIENT K515
Not good, not good, not good because you know as you can see I came in for a knee problem.

DOCTOR K515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K515
Uh I had uh whatcha call that ultrasound back here because there was a cyst back here.

DOCTOR K515
Right.

PATIENT K515
Okay and then so the knee is still giving me a lot of problems.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
They took x-rays of it but see I never heard and then like they said they were gonna contact me and let me know what the x-ray was okay but they never did and my knee still hurts.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
It hurts like a son-of-a-gun.  I don't know if it's cracked bone or if it's displaced or what you know.

DOCTOR K515
Sure.

PATIENT K515
But see they didn't call and let me know and that wasn't fair.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.  So the test you're referring to originally you had on March 15th?

PATIENT K515
I don't know what day it was.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.  Uh was that when you came in to Urgent Care?

PATIENT K515
Okay then I came back again.

DOCTOR K515
Right.

PATIENT K515
They took x-rays of it this time.  You don’t have nothing in there for me?

DOCTOR K515
No I do yeah.

PATIENT K515
Okay.  Well they @@@.

DOCTOR K515
Was that the time you came in in the middle of February.

PATIENT K515
It was the cyst.

DOCTOR K515
It was the cyst and then you came in because you still had pain.

PATIENT K515
Right.

DOCTOR K515
On March 15th.

PATIENT K515
Now do I have any broken bones?

DOCTOR K515
Uh let's look.

PATIENT K515
See I don't know nothing you know.

DOCTOR K515
I apologize that they didn't call.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Um. 

PATIENT K515
See I don't know, like I said all I know is that my knee hurts, it still hurts.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
I don't have a brace, no cane or nothing you know, they just send me out there.

DOCTOR K515
Point to where the pain is.

PATIENT K515
When I walk, the whole area.

DOCTOR K515
The whole area, so there's not one area in particular?

PATIENT K515
No, no, especially when I'm walking.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
And I don't have a brace.  Well really I can't afford a brace.

DOCTOR K515
We can give you one.

PATIENT K515
Thank you.

DOCTOR K515
So it looks like they saw some preventative things that were consistent with old age.  Your bones getting older.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
And then they saw that um small calcified area which could be the same area as where the cyst is.  I don't know if the cyst is in there.

PATIENT K515
That's in the back of the knee there right?

DOCTOR K515
It's in the back of the knee.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Um which is where the same place that it's showing on the x-ray.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
So it is on the ultrasound.

PATIENT K515
But no broken bones?

DOCTOR K515
No broken bones.

PATIENT K515
Okay.  Just old age setting in right?

DOCTOR K515
Yeah and then this little cyst that you have.

PATIENT K515
It's still there?

DOCTOR K515
Uh well at least on the 15th it was still there.

PATIENT K515
Because they say it had busted and the fluid was running down my leg and that's what by touching the tissue that's what brought the pain on.

DOCTOR K515
Um.

PATIENT K515
So that's what they told me what the ultrasound said okay.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
You know I mean I want the truth, that's all I want you know.

DOCTOR K515
Sure.  I understand completely.  Um, let me look at your ultrasound.  Okay so after your appointment, after you had the ultrasound.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
They told you there was a cyst there or they told you that it burst?

PATIENT K515
It bursted.

DOCTOR K515
Okay um.

PATIENT K515
And the fluid running down.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.  Did you feel it?

PATIENT K515
That's what started.  No.

DOCTOR K515
Oh.

PATIENT K515
I felt the pain.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
Okay and now it's like I feel the pain when I'm walking but I also feel my bones, you know what I mean like man.

DOCTOR K515
Right.

PATIENT K515
It doesn't feel good doc.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.  Well so on the ultrasound um it shows that there's a cyst there.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
I don't see that it, so if it could have popped between now and then but when you had the ultrasound done on the 19th there was a cyst there.

PATIENT K515
There was a cyst there.

DOCTOR K515
Yes.

PATIENT K515
And it bursted because they said that if the cyst was there they could go on in and draw the fluid out.

DOCTOR K515
Sometimes.  It depends on how big it is and if it's not very big.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
Then you know sometimes the risk of the procedure doesn't weigh out the benefit.

PATIENT K515
Okay we're cool.

DOCTOR K515
But your body will eventually, you know.

PATIENT K515
Okay I understand.

DOCTOR K515
Take care of it on its own.

PATIENT K515
But why, let me understand, why did they tell me it burst and fluid running down, that's why the pain in there because the fluid's pushing tissue?

DOCTOR K515
I'm not sure.

PATIENT K515
You see?

DOCTOR K515
I can't answer that.

PATIENT K515
Right, you see and it wasn't necessary to tell a story about that you know and I have to be concerned about my health now you know.  So I'm not trying to put you in the ballgame here, I just want fair answers.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
That's all you know anyway.

DOCTOR K515
You're entitled to fair answers.

PATIENT K515
Right.

DOCTOR K515
Okay, so you taking anything for the pain?

PATIENT K515
I was taking Tylenol and then codeine with Tylenol before I went to bed but I don't have any more.  See I'm not working, I'm unemployed, I can't afford it so usually DOCTOR was providing a prescription for me.

DOCTOR K515
So even before you would come in you were taking the Tylenol.

PATIENT K515
Right.

DOCTOR K515
Not the pain medications.

PATIENT K515
No I didn't have any then.  I came in right away when it started pain.

DOCTOR K515
And how often are you taking them?

PATIENT K515
Don't have anymore.

DOCTOR K515
But when you were, when you did have them how often were you taking them?

PATIENT K515
Uh well as needed.  

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
I guess that's not saying much is it uh I would say.

DOCTOR K515
Once a day?

PATIENT K515
Once a day, once a day as far as the codeine because of the pain.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
And when I was walking today I was taking them during the daytime so yes.  The Tylenol with codeine I was taking about I'd say every other, maybe every two days.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
And I was taking them at night.

DOCTOR K515
Did they make you sleepy?

PATIENT K515
Yeah buddy.

DOCTOR K515

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
It's not like its.

DOCTOR K515
Well as your physician.

PATIENT K515

PATIENT K515
But @@@ either.

DOCTOR K515
I understand, I appreciate that.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
If you're going to use your Levitra I would not, I would suggest that you don't use cocaine anytime around that period.

PATIENT K515
Right, right, right, right, right, right so.  And then when I do that, that's just like maybe on New Year's, you know 4th of July, something like that.  Just when the Super Bowl you know when the guys.

DOCTOR K515
Special occasions.

PATIENT K515
Right you know and then it's not like a all night affair.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
You know.  I love my, I know how important my health is okay.

DOCTOR K515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K515
So but then that's just the thing because I'm not gonna lie to you you know.  I'm not a heavy user or anything.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.  So everything else looks okay.  Your blood pressure looks good.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
Your cholesterol looks good.  Um your kidneys got slightly worse but we're still, there's nothing that we would do differently.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
As far as the management on it.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
The main thing is to; the medications you take help prevent your kidneys from getting worse.

PATIENT K515
Good. Which medicine?

DOCTOR K515
The lisinopril?

PATIENT K515
Is that right?

DOCTOR K515
It's good for your blood pressure and it also helps protect your kidneys.

PATIENT K515
Good but that's the thing I drink a lot of water.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
I do, I mean I do it every day.  I drink a lot of water.  It doesn't, not gonna work against me is it?

DOCTOR K515
No.

PATIENT K515
Okay good.

DOCTOR K515
Okay and then you had a colonoscopy in 2006.

PATIENT K515
Yeah.

DOCTOR K515
And it was normal so we don't have to repeat it and then you saw the urologist in February and they said just follow up in one year.

PATIENT K515
Okay.  Now I got a question to ask you cause see.

DOCTOR K515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K515
When I saw the urologist last, he said I got kind of scared there because I had to go back for my what's that reading called, the P.

DOCTOR K515
You had the ultrasound and you had the biopsy.

PATIENT K515
Yeah but it's a reading that that of the prostate.

DOCTOR K515
The PSA?

PATIENT K515
PSA okay.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
And so like they were checking on that you know to see if I had cancer or not cause it was kind of high then I think you know.  But now I ask you this, even though you're not a urologist.

DOCTOR K515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K515
I've heard that there's a cure for prostate cancer.

DOCTOR K515
There's treatment for it.  You can do surgery, you can do radiation and you can get chemotherapy depending on um how bad it is, where it is.

PATIENT K515
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K515
On what needs to be done.

PATIENT K515
But mine being in the position where like it's being checked on.

DOCTOR K515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K515
It shouldn't get that far gone.

DOCTOR K515
Correct.

PATIENT K515
I mean all I have to do is just kind of let you know what's happening right.

DOCTOR K515
Right, so what happens is that in general we um we used to use the PSA test.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
More so we found over the recent years that it's not a great screening test for prostate cancer.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Unlike colon cancer you know where you can go and look with a camera.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
And you can see and you can take out a polyp right away.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
Um you know the PSA is just a blood test.

PATIENT K515
Right.

DOCTOR K515
So um you know there are patients who have a low PSA.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
With prostate cancer, there’s patients with a high PSA and have prostate cancer so it's not a great test.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
So that's why, when it's high um you know you kind of have to weigh the risks and benefit of doing a biopsy.

PATIENT K515
Okay, okay, okay.

DOCTOR K515
Or if you want to go down that route.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
But sometimes prostate cancer can be very slow growing and so just the fact that we now have this test.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
And we're checking earlier.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
Um it doesn't necessarily mean that we're improved.  Changing the duration of your life per say.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
It just means that we're being more invasive about how we check things and how we do things.

PATIENT K515
You see it's like, see my father died of prostate cancer.

DOCTOR K515
How old was he?

PATIENT K515
69.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
Okay and uh the reason being @@@ I was just so very angry with the VA you know and it was a long time before I trusted the VA or even got seen.  He was at Hines.

DOCTOR K515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K515
And they knew he had cancer and sent him to the county.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
And that wasn't fair and I detested the VA for that you know.  Never trusted them again but I mean I'm okay with that now you know because that's years gone back, I need the VA care and all that but if I didn't like the VA I'd go to the county, you know what I mean.
DOCTOR K515
Right.

PATIENT K515
But because I want to go where I'm comfortable.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
See.  Excuse me @@@ and I'm comfortable here with @@@ doctor has given me you know but this is just something I will never forget and the trust had to be I mean like I just didn't trust them but I'm okay now.  You know I explained that to the other doctors you know.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
So they were wrong for doing that to my father so and anyway.

DOCTOR K515
So you're being, I mean given that it runs in your family um then you know they're watching you more carefully.

PATIENT K515
Okay, okay, right.

DOCTOR K515
Typically you know 69 is still um, it's not unreasonable for somebody to have prostate cancer at that age.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
It's you know cause everybody's living longer now.

PATIENT K515
Right.

DOCTOR K515
If you live long enough you'll eventually get some form of cancer.

PATIENT K515
Right, right.

DOCTOR K515
Somewhere.

PATIENT K515
Right, right, right, right.

DOCTOR K515
Um but in your case the urologist just wants you to check in with them every year, we'll get that test done.

PATIENT K515
Okay good, good, good.

DOCTOR K515
So I'm sure they told you but your prostate biopsy was negative.

PATIENT K515
Right.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
Yes.  Yes.  Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Okay so um, let's see @@@. 

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
How are your allergies?

PATIENT K515
I was going to ask you @@@ have a little rash up in here or something.  Some cortisone cream.

DOCTOR K515
Uh-huh.  Okay take a deep breath for me and out again.  Sounds good.  Lay down for me.  Does it hurt when I push on your knees?

PATIENT K515
Somewhat.

DOCTOR K515
Okay what about back here?

PATIENT K515
Somewhat I can feel it.

DOCTOR K515
Does it feel like pressure?

PATIENT K515
Yeah pressure, I can feel the pressure but the pain is on a scale of one or two.

DOCTOR K515
We'll look at this.

PATIENT K515
And you can see doctor this knee is still swollen.

DOCTOR K515
(Pt. shifts position) No that's okay.

PATIENT K515
Right in there where.

DOCTOR K515
Right here where I'm pushing?

PATIENT K515
Right.

DOCTOR K515
Yeah, I still feel a cyst there.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Usually in here, give me your hand, can you feel behind your leg.

PATIENT K515
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR K515
That little, it gives a little.

PATIENT K515
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K515
And when you feel behind your right leg.

PATIENT K515
Okay, okay, right, right, right.  So the cyst is there.

DOCTOR K515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K515
Okay, okay, okay, alright.

DOCTOR K515
Yeah I agree.  There's nothing we would do in terms of draining it.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Your body will naturally absorb the fluid.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
It will go away.

PATIENT K515
@@@.

DOCTOR K515
How long that takes, everyone's different.

PATIENT K515
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K515
Yeah so you know you could have it for a while and it could be gone in a few weeks.

PATIENT K515
Oh okay.

DOCTOR K515
It's hard to say.

PATIENT K515
Okay well doc you know what, I see I do exercise a lot.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
But yeah I do the treadmill.  I don't go fast; you know I don't run, because I can't run no way.  I go at a steady pace and then for about, I do it for 20 minutes.  Okay the first 10 minutes I'm like this okay and then for like the next five minutes, which @@@ I turn it up two notches but then the last five minutes I decrease.

DOCTOR K515
Okay, so is it making the pain worse when you do that?

PATIENT K515
No.

DOCTOR K515
It doesn't bother you at all?

PATIENT K515
No, no.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
No and then when I get off then here come the pain again.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
So.

DOCTOR K515
Um.

PATIENT K515
But now they have a little cycle you know.

DOCTOR K515
Yeah.

PATIENT K515
I do that but slow.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
You know is that okay?

DOCTOR K515
Yeah I mean its all okay.  It could be though that you know all the exercise you're doing with the bending of the knee could be irritating it a little bit so it's making it harder for the, you know for the fluid to reabsorb.  So you might want to lay off of it for a few weeks and see if it doesn't go down.

PATIENT K515
So leave the treadmill alone.

DOCTOR K515
Um well it's better to do a sitting bike.

PATIENT K515
Like I have been.

DOCTOR K515
Although the biking is still, you're still gonna be moving your knee.

PATIENT K515
Okay so now they have two kinds.  The have the type with the bicycle one like this.

DOCTOR K515
Uh-huh.

PATIENT K515
And then they have a cycle to go like this.

DOCTOR K515
The cycle sitting, laying would be better.

PATIENT K515
Okay.  No pain.

DOCTOR K515
Um at least until this heals a little bit uh but you're still, it means you're still gonna have the constant motion on.

PATIENT K515
On the treadmill.

DOCTOR K515
Can you swim at all?

PATIENT K515
Can I swim?

DOCTOR K515
Yeah.

PATIENT K515
I don't have a swimming pool to go to.

DOCTOR K515
Yeah okay.

PATIENT K515
So stay off the treadmill.

DOCTOR K515
So let's try it for a few weeks and see if it doesn't help decrease the fluid in there.

PATIENT K515
But pick up the cycling.

DOCTOR K515
If you want to do exercise, try doing the cycle where you're sitting down.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Okay and or you could try doing other things with your arms or @@@.

PATIENT K515
I do.

DOCTOR K515
And do that instead.

PATIENT K515
I was thinking of what @@@.

DOCTOR K515
No weights on the legs though.

PATIENT K515
No.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
Okay.  Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Let's give the leg a rest.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
And see if it doesn't improve.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

PATIENT K515
Alright.

DOCTOR K515
You can sit up.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Okay, just give me a few minutes I'll be right back.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

DOCTOR K515
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  64:40  DOCTOR IN:  77:48)

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Hello.

PATIENT K515
Hello there.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
How are you today?  I'm DOCTOR.

PATIENT K515
Nice to meet you DOCTOR.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
That's a strong handshake you got there.  I @@@ to introduce myself. So it's the left knee that bothers you?

PATIENT K515
The left knee yes.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Okay.  Can I look at it?

PATIENT K515
Sure excuse me.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Where does it hurt, is it just all the way across, around?

PATIENT K515
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
And they noted the calcifications on the lateral side right?

FIRST DOCTOR K515
Posterolateral.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Can you straighten your leg out for me.  Well at any rate it doesn't look like anything that was serious.  It @@@ ligamentous or calcified loose body so I don't think that's anything to be worried about but it could be causing some discomfort okay.  I don't.

FIRST DOCTOR K515
I mean it's very small but if you compare it and feel it on the right knee you'll feel that.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Yeah.

FIRST DOCTOR K515
@@@

SECOND DOCTOR K515
It almost feels fatty.

PATIENT K515
Fatty.  Nobody's ever said it's just fat.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
No it's probably fluid, but that's what it feels like yeah.  It's not actual fat, it’s fluid in here.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
You can feel when I'm touching it.

PATIENT K515
Yes.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
But it feels very fatty.  It's fluid.

PATIENT K515
But its fluid.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
That's the way cysts happen I mean yeah.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Like no that fluid, would not run down, you know its inside and it would not ever.

PATIENT K515
No kidding, why did they tell me that?

SECOND DOCTOR K515
I don't know, that was kind of a silly thing to say to you.  That's not, I mean I don't know exactly what they said but.

PATIENT K515
Okay, okay.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
But it's @@@.

PATIENT K515
No I understand that.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
But the other thing is do you eat a lot of foods that are high in potassium like green leafy vegetables @@@.

PATIENT K515
Yeah.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Well the only thing is your potassium is a little too high.

PATIENT K515
It going too high?

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Yeah so maybe we could back down a little bit.

PATIENT K515
Okay now what food has potassium in it, I have to watch that right?

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Yeah.

PATIENT K515
Cause I ate about four bananas yesterday.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Yeah so not too much.  That's what I'm saying is potassium is good for you but too much of it can affect your heart because that potassium can affect, is part of the cycle the heart rate @@@ uh is affected by potassium, sodium, things all found in food.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
So that can actually, if it gets too high… actually it.

PATIENT K515
So now I have to go look up what foods have high potassium, there you go thank you very much.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
I might have something here.

PATIENT K515
Because I had a test done to see how my potassium was.

FIRST DOCTOR K515
And I want to recheck it today so that was in February so I'll make sure it's still not going up.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
@@@.

PATIENT K515
And then I won't see you no more for about.  Well I'll tell you what, why don't I take a test about a couple weeks before I come back in again, by that way we can tell.  If you check it now I'll have to come back in four or five months.

FIRST DOCTOR K515
Oh but it's high now.

PATIENT K515
Oh.

FIRST DOCTOR K515
We'll have to make adjustments to your medications.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
For some things that's a good idea but if we're worried about what it is today we should probably have it.

PATIENT K515
Okay.  Alright.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
So this is a list of high potassium foods so you should avoid those things.  Just nothing in excess, so just don't go over the top.

PATIENT K515
Over the top.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
@@@

PATIENT K515
Potatoes?  I love potatoes.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Well just not too much of.

PATIENT K515
Just not all the time.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Just watch them.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Yeah.  @@@ as soon as you can and I mean if it comes back down you know you can.

PATIENT K515
Okay, so.  I’m just being sarcastic, I'm gonna follow your direction.

FIRST DOCTOR K515
And you, it sounds like you’re eating a lot of these.

PATIENT K515
Yes.

FIRST DOCTOR K515
So if back down a little for long and we'll see how it goes.

PATIENT K515
Okay, okay, okay.

FIRST DOCTOR K515
The foods are perfectly okay.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
It just so happens that there was too much potassium.

PATIENT K515
Okay I can do that.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
Okay I think DOCTOR's got a good plan for you.

PATIENT K515
Thank you.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
It was nice meeting you.

PATIENT K515
Likewise.

SECOND DOCTOR K515
I'm not shaking your hand again that hurt.

PATIENT K515

FIRST DOCTOR K515
Okay so your blood pressure's well controlled on the lisinopril and amlodipine.

PATIENT K515
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR K515

PATIENT K515
Okay now okay.  Am I gonna pick up anything at the Pharmacy?

FIRST DOCTOR K515
Yeah you're gonna pick up your Tylenol #3.
