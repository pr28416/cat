DOCTOR D596
Yeah.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
Alright let me ask you a few questions okay.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
Uh your sugars, any low sugars?  What's the lowest your sugar's been?

PATIENT D596
90 something.

DOCTOR D596
Perfect.  Alright cause I don't, like even @@@.

PATIENT D596
I don't want to go down lower cause, eat something to bring it back up or @@@.

DOCTOR D596
Perfect. Um I don't want like anything lower than 80 something okay.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
Um what's the highest your sugar's been.

PATIENT D596
The highest since I been taking these medication, uh close to 300.

DOCTOR D596
Oh.

PATIENT D596
No 200, 200 and that's when I first started.

DOCTOR D596
Okay, okay @@@.

PATIENT D596
It's been under 200.

DOCTOR D596
Oh that's pretty good.

PATIENT D596
It's been under 200.

DOCTOR D596
Pretty good.

PATIENT D596
Now there's some days that it might go up a little, over 200 or something like that but.

DOCTOR D596
Okay.

PATIENT D596
The majority is under 200.

DOCTOR D596
Wow that's excellent.

PATIENT D596
Yeah I see a difference too.

DOCTOR D596
Better energy.

PATIENT D596
Yeah.

DOCTOR D596
Not peeing so much.

PATIENT D596
Right.

DOCTOR D596
Good I'm glad.

PATIENT D596
At nighttime too I.

DOCTOR D596
Yeah.

PATIENT D596
It used to be three, four times, now it's a couple you know.

DOCTOR D596
And when your sugars are that high it's what we call @@@ to make you pee basically.

PATIENT D596
Yeah.

DOCTOR D596
Sugar pools in your urine and then it makes a lot more urine basically.

PATIENT D596
She was telling me that the metformin, she gave me the metformin 1000.

DOCTOR D596
Twice a day.

PATIENT D596
Twice a day right.

DOCTOR D596
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D596
Because if I do work, if I work out with it that is going to go to the bone right?

DOCTOR D596
No exactly.

PATIENT D596
Or it's good for bones or what's the reason behind the fact that I got to go out and walk around and you know like do four or five blocks and everything like that?

DOCTOR D596
Well exercise by itself will help you lower your sugars.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
But uh it might help what we call, so metformin is what we call a sensitizer.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
It makes your body more receptive to the insulin that you're earlier.

PATIENT D596
Oh gotcha okay.

DOCTOR D596
Yeah so um so if you take metformin and you work out and it basically helps your body absorb the sugar in your blood, it goes to the muscle, everywhere else, supports the liver and things like that.  So instead of hanging in around your blood, which is bad, it goes to where it should go basically like the liver.

PATIENT D596
So a good workout would be, consist of what, sitting up, standing up, walking around, two blocks, three blocks, @@@.

DOCTOR D596
Good question.

PATIENT D596
Running, uh going around the block one time or what?  So before I take the pill, after I take the pill or?

DOCTOR D596
@@@.

PATIENT D596
What way works better?

DOCTOR D596
Uh it doesn't matter.  The idea for exercise is consistency and duration.  Um it doesn't matter what you do but the idea is to raise your heart rate for at least 30 minutes a day.

PATIENT D596
Consistently.

DOCTOR D596
Consistently.  Uh but it doesn't have to be @@@ day.

PATIENT D596
That would be what, that would how?

DOCTOR D596
If you like to swim, if you like to walk really fast.

PATIENT D596
I'll be doing it; I just finished taking a course on swimming.

DOCTOR D596
Great.

PATIENT D596
Okay, learning how to swim.

DOCTOR D596
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D596
And I'm going to college over at @@@.

DOCTOR D596
Great.

PATIENT D596
And I took a class and then now for some reason they shut it down for the semester.

DOCTOR D596
Oh.

PATIENT D596
Cause of safety hazard.

DOCTOR D596
Okay.

PATIENT D596
Some reason, something to do with safety.

DOCTOR D596
Any aerobic activity, swimming, walking really fast, treadmills, Stairmasters, elliptical machines, things like that.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
This will help bring up your heart rate, help you burn some calories and work on your muscles.  Cause muscles, when you work on them, they get stronger and then they give you use energy which is good.

PATIENT D596
That's good.

DOCTOR D596
Yeah exactly so the glucose that's hanging around in your blood gets burned off by your muscles.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
Okay.  So I'm glad you asked me about that um otherwise I'm going to continue things, except for increasing the blood pressure medication, I'm going to continue.  Tell you what; do you have a good phone number I could reach you at?

PATIENT D596
Yeah.  My wife's.

DOCTOR D596
Oh she'll get on your case then.

PATIENT D596
Yeah.

DOCTOR D596
Okay.

PATIENT D596
NUMBER.

DOCTOR D596

DOCTOR D596

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
But.

PATIENT D596
Why?

DOCTOR D596
So I mean, you're clearly heading in the right direction and I'm very encouraged by it.

PATIENT D596
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D596
Um you're last; we'll see what the A1c is today.

PATIENT D596
Right.

DOCTOR D596
Whenever we get your blood tests results and we'll talk about that.

PATIENT D596

DOCTOR D596
What's a good time to call you to make sure that you're home?

PATIENT D596

PATIENT D596

PATIENT D596

DOCTOR D596

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
And then we'll go over them and then to see if we want to change any of your medications.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
Okay.  But you're doing all the right things.  You just have to follow up with the foot doctor to make sure, you know as a diabetic, you know you're prone to having more foot ulcerations and ulcerations can lead to really bad.

PATIENT D596
I've heard, that I had, when I bought these boots they were giving me a scab.

DOCTOR D596
Yeah.

PATIENT D596
But look at it, it healed.  It's healed.  I used to take a while for it to heal and that’s a sign right there.

DOCTOR D596
Exactly.

PATIENT D596
So I'm doing something right.

DOCTOR D596
Right.  And really high sugars will impair your wound healing basically and it sounds like you're @@@.

PATIENT D596
Yeah.

DOCTOR D596
faster.

PATIENT D596
I got another question, well a couple of questions uh I got this cough.

DOCTOR D596
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D596
I don't know I keep coughing and coughing and coughing and I had it for about, going on a month.

DOCTOR D596
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D596
Sometimes it lasts for about three minutes, four minutes and then it'll go away and it's kind of bad when you're in class.

DOCTOR D596
Right.

PATIENT D596
Trying to listen to the teacher and you have this cough so I've been drinking water you know.

DOCTOR D596
Okay.

PATIENT D596
To sooth it or something like that.  I need something that's going to go on ahead and cut it out, am I sick, do I have a cold or what, what is it?

DOCTOR D596
Well let’s gonna talk about that.  Um like how many times do you cough like that in a day?

PATIENT D596
A day?  About three or four times.

DOCTOR D596
Okay.  Uh when you cough to you bring anything up?

PATIENT D596

PATIENT D596
Only when I start coughing cause it makes me want to cough and cough and then my chest I got.

DOCTOR D596
Yeah.

PATIENT D596
It's not hurting in my chest but it's tight.

DOCTOR D596

PATIENT D596
And then after a while if I start coughing too much I could feel like uh muscles, you know they're tightening up.

DOCTOR D596
Uh-huh.

PATIENT D596
Yeah.

DOCTOR D596
From what you're telling me I'm not too concerned about it.  People do get these irritations in their throats and these.

PATIENT D596
Sometimes I get runny nose too.  It'll run, it's just like clear.

DOCTOR D596
Yeah.  Viruses hang on. Most of them are caused by viruses.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
There's no antibiotic or anything.

PATIENT D596
So I just got to let it run its course.

DOCTOR D596
I can give you some cough medication that maybe helps suppress the cough a little but you'll get better basically.

PATIENT D596

DOCTOR D596
Do you get a tickling sensation in your throat before you cough or?

PATIENT D596
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR D596
So I'll give you some lozenges as well.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
And then um you can, like when you're in class you can.

PATIENT D596
Take them.

DOCTOR D596
Yeah, you can take them a little prophylactically.

PATIENT D596
Okay.

DOCTOR D596
So when you feel like it's a bad day or something like that.

PATIENT D596
I can feel it coming cause it starts tickling you know and I'm like trying to hold it, try not to cough.  So I buy a bottle and not a cold bottle of water just regular temperature.

DOCTOR D596
