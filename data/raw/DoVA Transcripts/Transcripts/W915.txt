@@@.

PATIENT W915
I think that, I don't notice it but I think that's what messes things up.

DOCTOR W915
Well sometimes your blood pressure is a little lower in the morning and you know we don't want to have it at 158.

PATIENT W915
Right, right.  Okay now to ask you the second question.

DOCTOR W915
Yeah.

PATIENT W915
Did I take them this morning?

DOCTOR W915
Yes.

PATIENT W915
No.

DOCTOR W915
That would be one reason.

PATIENT W915
I didn't take them because I've been out of them for the last, just about two months now.

DOCTOR W915
Why, did you run out, did you run out of refills or?

PATIENT W915

See so and there was no refills on the order.

DOCTOR W915
Oh.

PATIENT W915
So uh I was stuck.

DOCTOR W915
Right, yeah you were stuck.  Um we'll have to figure that for next year when you go to Florida cause you only go to Florida during the winter.

PATIENT W915
Yes and in October I'll be going again.

DOCTOR W915
Okay.

PATIENT W915
So I should see you again in September.

DOCTOR W915
Yeah then we'll give you plenty of refills so this doesn't happen again.

PATIENT W915
Yeah.  Well I need to; I have them now uh also.

DOCTOR W915
Yeah, but you have to get them before. 

PATIENT W915
Yeah and I also, (coughs) don’t get older, honey.

DOCTOR W915
Gotcha alright.

PATIENT W915

DOCTOR W915
Okay.

PATIENT W915
And I need three boxes.

DOCTOR W915
Okay.

PATIENT W915
And uh the wafers, the 4 inch by 4 inch, I'll need six boxes.

DOCTOR W915
Okay.

PATIENT W915
And uh the Benzene, tincture of Benzene I'll need three bottles and then I'll need the blood pressure pills.

DOCTOR W915
Uh-huh.  Okay.

PATIENT W915
And may I have that back?

DOCTOR W915
Yes you can.  Let me just write down these names.

PATIENT W915
Or you can make a copy of it if you wanted to.

DOCTOR W915
Oh, I could just copy down the list.

PATIENT W915
If you want it in your files that's fine.

DOCTOR W915
Yeah I'm gonna put it.

PATIENT W915
I keep a file of my own.

DOCTOR W915
Oh that's good.

PATIENT W915
And uh like I said I forgot to ask for the we were talking about something else and I forgot to ask for the last copy.

DOCTOR W915
Right.

PATIENT W915
That was the blood was so uh after the 20th, April 24th or 25th, something like that.

DOCTOR W915
Okay.

PATIENT W915
I don't remember the date.  

DOCTOR W915
Alright.  So, @@@ here @@@.

PATIENT W915
Yeah.

DOCTOR W915
That's all you're really taking and um that would be why your blood pressure’s a little up.  Even though it's good in the morning it fluctuates throughout the day.

PATIENT W915
Yeah well it's milder you know after eating and other things and like that why it's bound to go up yeah.

DOCTOR W915
Right.  Um.

PATIENT W915
But not as much as what it did.

DOCTOR W915
Right.  How's the osteoarthritis?  How are your joints feeling?

PATIENT W915
Bad.

DOCTOR W915
Bad.  Do you take anything for them?

PATIENT W915
Um down in Florida why I had, well now it's sore and like that, this ankle and of course arthritis as you know, arthritis goes from one to the other.

DOCTOR W915
Right.

PATIENT W915
Years ago when I was in my 20s I broke both ankles.  I think it was this one that just had, just had the crack and the other one had a spiral fracture into it so arthritis goes back and forth.

DOCTOR W915
Right.

PATIENT W915
Both knees why I've blown those out years and years ago.

DOCTOR W915
Okay.

PATIENT W915
So I have problems with my knees also and that's why every once in a while I walk with a stick.

DOCTOR W915
I see, I see.

PATIENT W915
So um um.

DOCTOR W915
Do you have time to get labs checked today?

PATIENT W915
What kind of a check?

DOCTOR W915
Labs, just the labs.

PATIENT W915
Oh the blood you mean.

DOCTOR W915
Yeah, do you have time for the lab tests?

PATIENT W915
Yeah sure.

DOCTOR W915
And for the medication do you want to pick all this up?  Do you normally pick this up from the Pharmacy or have them mailed?

PATIENT W915
No that takes too long and by the time I would get there why I have my car in the valet.

DOCTOR W915
Hmm.

PATIENT W915
And if you don't get there before the valet leaves then you have to walk all the way up to what is it the sixth floor or something like that.

DOCTOR W915
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT W915
And I can't do that.

DOCTOR W915
Okay.

PATIENT W915
So no just have it sent, all of them sent.

DOCTOR W915
Okay.

PATIENT W915
And uh the address uh, do you have.

DOCTOR W915
They should have it in the Pharmacy.

PATIENT W915
Well yeah but I just changed the address this morning and like that.

DOCTOR W915
Okay so you have to go, cause I can't change it in the computer.

PATIENT W915
Now the woman there she said it would change to all of them.

DOCTOR W915
Okay yep, then it'll change and that's where they'll mail it to you.

PATIENT W915
Yeah I asked her particular if it would change in the Pharmacy and she said yes.

DOCTOR W915
Yep, yep.

PATIENT W915
So I hope they send it to the right place.

DOCTOR W915
Exactly.

PATIENT W915
If they don't it goes to Florida, then comes back.

DOCTOR W915
Let's see oh yeah, that wouldn't be good.

PATIENT W915
I wouldn't trust the post office too.

DOCTOR W915
Yeah I'm with you.  Um and you needed the @@@.  So the wafer one +40, So how many of those 4 inch by 4 inch wafers do you use each day?

PATIENT W915
Uh okay you're regularly supposed to use one a day.  I take and cut the center out, that's one time and then there's the edges that I use that's another time so two of them uh, one lasts for a week.

DOCTOR W915
Okay.

PATIENT W915
And there are five into a box.

DOCTOR W915
Yeah okay, so you need six boxes, I see okay, got it.

PATIENT W915
Now that's to take me to six months I hope.  If that doesn't why I'll be here and I can order it but when I'm down in Florida why uh, I can send the order back and like that if I get an order but if there wasn't any refills or like that well then I'm sort of stuck.

DOCTOR W915
One pouch every two days and you change the pouch every three days or every day?

PATIENT W915
