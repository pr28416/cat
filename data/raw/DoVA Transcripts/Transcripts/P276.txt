PATIENT P276
@@@ one of those questions I had for you.

DOCTOR P276
Okay.

PATIENT P276
@@@.

DOCTOR P276
Woo, @@@.

PATIENT P276

PATIENT P276

DOCTOR P276
What else?

PATIENT P276
And uh I've been noticing my pulse rate.

DOCTOR P276
Yes.  Okay.

PATIENT P276
You @@@ for the last two weeks.

DOCTOR P276
How @@@ okay.

PATIENT P276
So it’s been rising, the one of them.

DOCTOR P276
Right I see that.  The high, the 100s, what was going on when they're in the 100s.

PATIENT P276
It doesn't seem to matter.

DOCTOR P276
Nothing @@@.

PATIENT P276
@@@.

DOCTOR P276
Okay.

PATIENT P276
Sometimes they're up and sometimes they're down.

DOCTOR P276
Okay.  Um well you've been taking the Digoxin, correct?

PATIENT P276
Uh.

DOCTOR P276
Excuse me, you stopped Digoxin @@@ and the atenolol.

PATIENT P276
@@@.

DOCTOR P276
The atenolol.

PATIENT P276
@@@.

DOCTOR P276
Are up to 50 millgrams?

PATIENT P276
No.

DOCTOR P276
No.

PATIENT P276
I don't have any pills.

DOCTOR P276
Okay @@@ your blood pressure is 110/74 okay.  Um, let me think about it because again, I think it’s a good thing that you’re off of the Digoxin.

PATIENT P276
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P276
Okay.  Um and so the question is do we go up on the atenolol a little more, @@@ 37.5.

PATIENT P276
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P276
And just monitor your blood pressure.  Have you been feeling dizzy at all?

PATIENT P276
No.

DOCTOR P276
Um because if you were feeling dizzy then I'd be hesitant to raise the dose but if you're not then let's go up on it slowly.

PATIENT P276
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR P276
Okay so instead of doubling the dose we'll go up @@@.

PATIENT P276
Okay @@@.

DOCTOR P276
Okay, alright sounds good.  Um and the appointment for Audiology is for hearing adis?

PATIENT P276
For the hearing aid.

DOCTOR P276
For your hearing aids.

DOCTOR P276
Okay.  Could you go today?

PATIENT P276
No.  Wish I could but I can't.

DOCTOR P276
Okay.  How long have you been wearing the hearing aids?

PATIENT P276

DOCTOR P276
Okay.

PATIENT P276

DOCTOR P276
