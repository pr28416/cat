Actually I've experienced the muscle spasms in my face.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
And down through my arm.  It gets better and worse um.  I feel, I don’t know how to explain, it's sort of just like a shooting pain from my like the middle of my spine.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
That's the thing is.  I can work with migraines.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
And uh my job has put me in a situation where occasionally I can work from home.

DOCTOR J576

PATIENT J576
And my last job I worked at home from my region.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
So I can work through migraines but when my back @@@ that's when @@@.

DOCTOR J576
Right, right.

PATIENT J576
So I just have to go and get seen for that.

DOCTOR J576
Okay so you go to the ER or Urgent Care, where do you go?

PATIENT J576
I go to the Urgent Care Clinic sometimes.

DOCTOR J576
Okay, okay.

PATIENT J576
I think my last visit was two Sundays ago.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
It's when I threw my back out.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
And I walked in and they kind of treated me like I was a drug dealer.

DOCTOR J576
Hmm, uh-huh, yeah that's happens all the time.  Sorry about that.

PATIENT J576
Yeah what happened was I went in the first time, they gave me Flexeril and uh ibuprofen.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
And that was like an Urgent Care @@@ actual visit.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
And I come in and she's like well do you want physical therapy and I say, well I went through six months of physical therapy.  Uh I went to a chiropractor for my back.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
Back in 2008.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
I would be out of pain for about six months.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
So I'd been through physical therapy uh I really don't want to go through physical therapy again.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
Plus my schedule won't allow it and she changed the conversation now from you know medicine isn't a quick fix.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
Isn't a long term fix.

DOCTOR J576
Right.

PATIENT J576
And so I told her well I didn't come in for medicine.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
As a matter of fact I did not take the Flexeril you guys gave me, the full bottle was attached.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah.

PATIENT J576
I can't be sleepy at work.

DOCTOR J576
Right, right.

PATIENT J576
You know.

DOCTOR J576
Did uh did you ever have any imaging of your back, any CT scans, x-rays, MRIs?

PATIENT J576
They did a x-ray there.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
And uh the chiropractor did a MRI and I believe an x-ray.

DOCTOR J576
Okay and what did they say?

PATIENT J576
Uh they said I have like a bulging in my disk.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
And the Army said it was, I don't know if it was a general classification they said it was a lumbar sprain.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.  

PATIENT J576
Actually is there any way I can get another one of these?

DOCTOR J576
Probably what is this?

PATIENT J576
This is my initial award letter.

DOCTOR J576
Oh okay, yeah probably we can get one of these.  I'll see if I can get them, you might just have to go to the financial people and they can print it out for you.

PATIENT J576
Okay.

DOCTOR J576
Let me ask DOCTOR, she might know.

PATIENT J576
Okay.

DOCTOR J576
Um okay so you mentioned a number of problems, specifically back pain but I'll ask you to prioritize.  That's one you need to list to be addressed.

PATIENT J576
What I'd like to be the most addressed is my emotional stability.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
That's a different conversation.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
Between the two of them uh.

DOCTOR J576
It's a tie.

PATIENT J576
The migraine usually hurts the worst.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
But it's the back pain that doesn't allow me to go to work.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah.  What's uh, what do you take for the migraines?

PATIENT J576
Tylenol, Motrin.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
And I ran out of medication a long time ago.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.  So did you used to take some some medicine, a migraine medication?

PATIENT J576
I was on Imitrex.

DOCTOR J576
Oh okay.

PATIENT J576
And then I was on Percocet for a stent but.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
I didn't like it.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT J576
So.

DOCTOR J576
Did the Imitrex help?

PATIENT J576
I didn't help relieve the migraines.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
It helped prevent the migraines.

DOCTOR J576
Okay, okay.  Gotcha.  Um.

PATIENT J576
For my sleeping I was on trazodone.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
But I believe towards the end of me taking trazodone, I don’t believe it was too successful.  

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
And it was like uh I would take it, I would have a window of sleepiness and that would pass and I would just be up the rest of the night.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah that's terrible.  Oh man okay.  We definitely have some things we should work on.

PATIENT J576
Yeah I know.  I should have been in but I.

DOCTOR J576
No that's okay.

PATIENT J576
I'm glad to see you.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah I know.  Life gets in the way sometimes.  It's a good thing your wife kept on you and I’m glad you came in today.  Um so let's see, well we can definitely restart some better medicines for the migraine.

PATIENT J576
Hmm.

DOCTOR J576
Um you know, so you can work through them and get what you need done but it's not good to be in pain all the time so we can definitely try something for the migraines.  Um for the back pain I think that um we can, you can definitely keep using pain medicines.  I'd like to do some probably more imaging to see what's going on there.  It's been a while, since the last time you got an MRI was in 2008 and I'd kind of like to repeat that to see what exactly is going on in there, if it's worse if it's better and maybe there's something we could do as far as spinal ablation, injection or surgery, something like that.  Just to see what our options are.

PATIENT J576
Okay.

DOCTOR J576
Um physical therapy is good.  It takes awhile to get into it here, due to the time but it's something that we may want to return to in the future.

PATIENT J576
Do they also, I also have a clinic by me.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
Do they also offer all services at that clinic?

DOCTOR J576
Um the physical therapists here?  I think so. @@@.

PATIENT J576
Go in and get physical therapy.

DOCTOR J576
Oh could you get it over there?  Hmm yeah maybe not, you might have to get it here.  Is that inconvenient? Where do you live?

PATIENT J576
I live in Olympia Fields.

DOCTOR J576
Where is that?  That isn't too familiar.

PATIENT J576
Do you know where the Chicago Heights clinic is?

DOCTOR J576
Um no.

PATIENT J576
Okay it's about from here, it’s about 50 miles south.

DOCTOR J576
Okay, okay.  Um okay yeah so it's a little drive okay.

PATIENT J576
I work down in the loop.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
I work down around Wells.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
But the issue would be like the day, it comes ever so often I get like these comp days.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
Where I have like today is my comp day, I have off, I have another comp day @@@.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah I do that.

PATIENT J576
That does give me time to get in for appointments.

DOCTOR J576
@@@.

PATIENT J576
Like just a regular.

DOCTOR J576
A regular physical therapy is not gonna work.  Okay.  Um well that's okay we can you know see what's gonna happen in the future.  Um and then especially this shooting pain in your spine I think imaging would be good you know.  Um and then finally what's going on with and we'll refill your albuterol um.  So we can take care of all those things um.  You could talk about something about insomnia, I'm going to ask DOCTOR what she thinks is best.

PATIENT J576
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J576
Um and then well let's talk about this emotional stuff.  Do you want to, do you want to see someone.  I know you have a history of some bipolar issues.

PATIENT J576
Yeah.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah um, but you're not on any medication right now?

PATIENT J576
No.

DOCTOR J576
Okay so are you having a lot of trouble with that lately?

PATIENT J576
Uh I'm having difficulty with just being stable emotionally.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
And then I'm also having issues with the whole PTSD.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.  Oh yeah, yeah.

PATIENT J576
And I was seen and I started counseling for that.

DOCTOR J576
Oh that's good.

PATIENT J576
But it was difficult for me to receive counseling.

DOCTOR J576
Oh okay.

PATIENT J576
And what I got from that was everybody else that was in there.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
Weren't active duties.

DOCTOR J576
Hmm.

PATIENT J576
They were reserves.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
And so as my conversation was that I'm having issues dealing with these convoys I've been on, the stuff I've seen, their issues were more along the line of active duty soldiers mistreated us.

DOCTOR J576
Oh.

PATIENT J576
And made it miserable and I talked to the doctor and I was like maybe this isn't for me @@@.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah, yeah.

PATIENT J576
You know uh I have, and I’m not saying that their issues aren’t serious.

DOCTOR J576
Right.

PATIENT J576
But I have issues connected to things I've experienced, things I've been through over there.

DOCTOR J576
Right.

PATIENT J576
And their issue, they're only problem is about me.

DOCTOR J576
Right, right, yeah.  Absolutely.  @@@  That's too bad.  Well what about, we should get you some individual counseling though I mean.

PATIENT J576
Yeah.

DOCTOR J576
Um yeah cause we could address both of those things.

PATIENT J576
Right.

DOCTOR J576
And they might say in conjunction you should do some group sessions, but you could also have your own therapist you could see you know.

PATIENT J576
I'm not really a, when it comes to like work stuff.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
Like when I was in the military and in my personal life now, 

DOCTOR J576
Yeah.

PATIENT J576
When it comes to work and I'm basically directing something or doing something.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah.

PATIENT J576
I'm fine in group session.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
As far as me and my personal life.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
I don't do very well with it.

DOCTOR J576
I see, okay.  You're like a lone wolf.  Okay.

PATIENT J576
It brings a lot of anxiety.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah okay.  Well we definitely can do individual sessions.  Um we'll, we can have you see one of our psychiatrists or psychologists here, we could do that.  Um and if they suggestion group sessions, you tell them what you told me and they'll work with you.

PATIENT J576
Okay.

DOCTOR J576
And they might also have some thoughts on new medications that might help.  Um I mean usually the @@@ is more for like @@@ stuff @@@ PTSD but.

PATIENT J576
I've been through a long list of bipolar medications.

DOCTOR J576
Oh yeah.

PATIENT J576
And the reason I talked to the last doctor and I didn't get any more is because.

DOCTOR J576
Did they not help or you don't like the side effects or both?

PATIENT J576
I generally experienced much in terms of side effects.  Uh I would say there were times when I took it - I mean the problems you have in those type of emotions is like you have to actually care.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
So there is – maybe have been a span of time where I was supposed to take it and I did take it.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
And I didn't get anything and I'm like okay for six months I haven't got anything.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah.

PATIENT J576
And then like a year later there might have been a time where it'd be getting to me, I was supposed to take it.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
And I was like screw this and I'll @@@ taking it.

DOCTOR J576
Okay, okay.

PATIENT J576
Yeah.  That's the kind of problem with the bipolar.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
You know it just depends on what you're feeling at the time unless you have someone to stuff it down your throat.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah, yeah.  Which you might have now, your wife.  Maybe yeah.  Okay I'm not the expert in any of that stuff or even what medicines there are so I'm going to leave it in the hands of those guys right now.  Uh I'm sure they'll bring that up.  So okay.  Um let me have you have a seat up here.  Let's take a look @@@ see what's going on.  Do you have any kids? 

PATIENT J576
I have two.

DOCTOR J576
Oh congratulations.  That's great.  How old are they?

PATIENT J576
Uh 18 months and 4 1/2.

DOCTOR J576
Oh my God, so cute.  Although the 4 1/2 is like, are they like rambunctious?

PATIENT J576
He exhausts us.  He's in preschool and he wants to come home and do everything.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah.

PATIENT J576
He saw someone else do.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah oh no yeah.  That's rough.  My sister @@@ started biting people.  I think she saw a kid doing that at preschool.

PATIENT J576
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J576
That wasn't good. I wasn’t good for me.  He's not biting people is he?

PATIENT J576
No he's not biting.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
He throws, kind throws these tantrum spells.

DOCTOR J576
Oh uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
So after, I usually, even though I work eight hours, I usually to go down to the city and back and I take the train, he usually ends up having to go about 12 hours plus of me being gone 12 hours and coming home that's when he just starts screaming at the top of his lungs.

DOCTOR J576
Right, right, right.  Yeah by then your wife @@@ too right.

PATIENT J576
Yeah.

DOCTOR J576
So it's tough on both of you.  Well at least he'll outgrow it.

PATIENT J576
Yeah.

DOCTOR J576
Hopefully you guys will survive through it.  I'm gonna listen to your heart.  Is the preschool half a day or a full day?

PATIENT J576
He's in a half a day right now.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah.

PATIENT J576
We can't afford the full day.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah. It’ll be good when he starts going to elementary school, for a full day.  @@@ shirt @@@ lungs @@@  Um deep breath, good.  One more.  Good.

DOCTOR J576
Well that's pretty impressive okay alright.  Try leaning to the side like that, does that hurt?

PATIENT J576
It's sore.

DOCTOR J576
Okay let's do the other side.

PATIENT J576
It's sore.

DOCTOR J576
Okay stand straight, @@@  rotate from the hip, down how about that?

PATIENT J576
Any type of movement.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh, it's a little bit sore.

PATIENT J576

DOCTOR J576
It's right in here?

PATIENT J576
So even when I bend down.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah it's a little bit sore.

PATIENT J576
Yeah.

DOCTOR J576
So is it like on the spine itself or is it more in the muscles to the side of it?

PATIENT J576
I don't even know.

DOCTOR J576
Let me try something and see what I think.  Tell me if it hurts more over here and here or when I press down here?

PATIENT J576
Actually none of that hurts.

DOCTOR J576
None of that hurts, good that's what we want to hear, @@@ massages.  Okay have a seat right down here.  Well, @@@.  Um let me talk with DOCTOR and come back and we'll get some prescriptions for you and then we'll send you over to see the Psych people today.

PATIENT J576
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J576
They have like a walk-in thing where they'll get what you need set up with them.

PATIENT J576
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR J576
So @@@ on-call in the clinic that day but it's also something that we'll order in the system for you okay.  And if they have thoughts of medicines they can discuss it with you.

PATIENT J576
Okay.

DOCTOR J576
Um and then finally um we might do some imaging.  You won't do that today; you'll just set it up whenever it’s convenient for for you.  Um and when was the last time they ran some labs on you.  How @@@?

PATIENT J576
I don't remember ever getting @@@.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah looks like they checked everything.  The cholesterol was great back in 2007; your liver function tests are fine.  Your kidneys were fine.  Looks like everything was good back then um.  Probably don't, uh I might want to repeat the cholesterol and the chemistry.  Okay, I’ll ask DOCTOR what she thinks. Sometimes we get @@@.  Okay anything else you want to mention before I go?

PATIENT J576
Nothing I can think of.

DOCTOR J576
@@@ come back in @@@ something we’re not addressing that you really want to.

PATIENT J576
No I'm not on that @@@.  I had a couple of personal, not personal but other questions.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
I would like to see @@@.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
And then also get my @@@.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
@@@.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.  Yeah we can definitely work on that.

PATIENT J576
I don't know if any of that is applicable to me.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
Yeah.  Then I was gonna request @@@.

DOCTOR J576
Okay let me see this.  I'll talk with DOCTOR on this yeah.  I see so you're not 100% service-connected?

PATIENT J576
No.

DOCTOR J576
So we need to get the form.

PATIENT J576
I'm only 70%.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
And also I was gonna see what it would take to get my rating changed.

DOCTOR J576
Uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
I talked to the VA Hospital and they said that it’s basically when your symptoms are worse.

DOCTOR J576
Right.

PATIENT J576
And my symptoms are definitely getting worse.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
@@@.

DOCTOR J576
Yeah we can definitely look.

PATIENT J576
Except for like two things.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.  Um let me take this with me to show her so it could jog her memory.  Uh yeah let's see.

PATIENT J576
Did I mention my knee?

DOCTOR J576
No.

PATIENT J576
I had surgery on my knee.

DOCTOR J576
Oh when was that?

PATIENT J576
It was back in like 2000.

DOCTOR J576
Okay.

PATIENT J576
And since then I've been seeing @@@ for my knee pain.

DOCTOR J576
Okay, I'll see @@@ notes last time she saw you.

PATIENT J576
But @@@ or something?

DOCTOR J576
Okay, uh-huh.

PATIENT J576
Um that basically prevents me from one because I’m walking upstairs to the train and you know uh any kind of walking I do hurts.  When I sit in a car for a long period of time it hurts.  I try to run to try and get in shape on the treadmill, it hurts.

PATIENT J576
The knee pain.

FIRST DOCTOR J576
Yeah the knee pain I think that we are going to um, yeah I told DOCTOR about that.  We didn't really get into it.  The um, I mean the gout medicine and the salsalate that helps you with the back pain will also help the knee pain.

PATIENT J576
Uh-huh.

FIRST DOCTOR J576
Um not that you won't still maybe have some pain and we'll have to readjust those since those are new meds or something but let's try these two, they’re also for knee.

PATIENT J576
But I won't be getting a consult to see the orthopedist for that sort of thing?

FIRST DOCTOR J576
Um I don't think so yet.

PATIENT J576
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR J576
Yeah I mean yeah I don't know.  Orthopedic surgeons like to operate.  (Second doctor comes in the room) You don't think he needs to see Ortho for his knee do you?

SECOND DOCTOR J576

PATIENT J576

PATIENT J576

FIRST DOCTOR J576

PATIENT J576

PATIENT J576

FIRST DOCTOR J576

PATIENT J576
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR J576
When I put the consult in too.  Um I want you to go to the Lab and give a blood draw.  You can go to X-Ray which is on this floor but all the way down by the @@@.

PATIENT J576

FIRST DOCTOR J576

FIRST DOCTOR J576
You come out our clinic and turn right so yeah towards X-Ray I guess.

PATIENT J576
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR J576
And then go to the Lab then X-Ray.  X-Ray will do the lumbar spine and then they'll schedule you for the MRIs okay.

PATIENT J576
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR J576

PATIENT J576

PATIENT J576
@@@

FIRST DOCTOR J576
Go to the Lab, then you go to Pharmacy to get the meds.  Um somewhere in there.

PATIENT J576
How long is that gonna take, a long time?

FIRST DOCTOR J576
The meds usually take a while so maybe I'd go do this first and then go do the meds.

PATIENT J576
Okay.

FIRST DOCTOR J576
You know what I mean, especially if they want to like add anything or you want to try something they suggest then you don't have to go back twice.  That'd be terrible.

PATIENT J576
@@@.

FIRST DOCTOR J576
This one they should be able to direct you up here.  They might be able to fill it out up there um.  The social worker is the person that could answer that question and she's also the person that can help you with the @@@.
