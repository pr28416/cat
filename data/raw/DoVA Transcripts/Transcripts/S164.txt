DOCTOR S164
So it was mainly the coughing and the shortness of breath?

PATIENT S164

DOCTOR S164
Are you smoking?

PATIENT S164
Uh uh.

DOCTOR S164
When did you quit?

PATIENT S164
Oh, about two years ago.

DOCTOR S164
How much did you smoke then?

PATIENT S164
About a pack and a half a day.

DOCTOR S164
For how long?

PATIENT S164
Oh, man all my life, since I was about 10 years.  I'm 82 now.

DOCTOR S164
Well they checked your lungs for emphysema in 2006 and it looks like you had emphysema.

PATIENT S164
Oh I did.

DOCTOR S164
Yeah.  So.

PATIENT S164
They didn't tell me.

DOCTOR S164
I think what we're seeing a little bit now is emphysema.

PATIENT S164
Oh.

DOCTOR S164
Sounds like we gotta get you tuned up okay.  I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT S164
You gotta get me tuned up?

DOCTOR S164
Yeah we're going to tune you up like a car, so we'll treat you better, I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT S164
Alright.

(DOCTOR OUT:  46:57  DOCTOR IN:  57:33)

DOCTOR S164
Okay.  I was talking to DOCTOR, he's my attending okay.

PATIENT S164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S164
And you have to; I think what's going on with you more than anything is what we call and exacerbation of emphysema.  When they looked at your lungs in 2006, you had emphysema.  Do you know what emphysema is?

PATIENT S164
Uh uh.

DOCTOR S164
Emphysema is when people who smoke all their life, even though you quit a couple years ago your lungs don't work as well and they start trapping air and you have a hard time getting air out.

PATIENT S164
Yeah.

DOCTOR S164
And um when you start having productive sputum like you're having with shortness of breath you can get an exacerbation of COPD and I think that's what we're seeing with you.

PATIENT S164
Hmm.

DOCTOR S164
Okay.

PATIENT S164
Okay.

DOCTOR S164
So there’s a goal to treating that, number one when I listen to you I don't hear pneumonia but given that you've had a lot going on.

PATIENT S164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S164
I want you to get a chest x-ray on the way out.

PATIENT S164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S164
If there’s an abnormality, I will call you.

PATIENT S164
Okay.

DOCTOR S164
I'm still going to give you it's for part of COPD exacerbations, 
what works well is I want to try giving antibiotics for five days.

PATIENT S164
Okay.

DOCTOR S164
It's called azithromycin okay.  I'll also want to give you um, who gives you your medications at home?

PATIENT S164
I take them myself.

DOCTOR S164
Okay, so you're pretty good about your medications?

PATIENT S164
Oh yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR S164
Okay so, the antibiotic is going to be and these will all be in the instructions, its two pills the first day and then one pill the next four days okay.

PATIENT S164
Okay.

DOCTOR S164
The steroid is going to be similar, what I'm gonna do is I'm going to give you some steroids to decrease the inflammation in your lungs.

PATIENT S164
Hmm.

DOCTOR S164
Okay.

PATIENT S164
Okay.

DOCTOR S164
This other stuff, have you ever been on steroids before?

PATIENT S164
No.

DOCTOR S164
Steroids have side effects okay.  Usually in the short term there are not that many side effects.

PATIENT S164
No.

DOCTOR S164
But sometimes people can get a little anxious.

PATIENT S164
You’re right.

DOCTOR S164
And can cause some confusion and it can cause your blood sugar to go higher.

PATIENT S164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S164
Okay.

PATIENT S164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S164
But it's gonna really help with your breathing I think.

PATIENT S164
That's good.

DOCTOR S164
It's a 9-day course where the first two days you take four pills, the next three days you take you know two pills, the next three days you take one pill.  It will all be on the instructions.

PATIENT S164
Okay.

DOCTOR S164
You take all of them and taper off, does that make sense?

PATIENT S164
That makes sense.

DOCTOR S164
And then I'm gonna start you on inhalers.  And inhalers are to help you breathe better.

PATIENT S164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S164
And you take two puffs of this inhaler every six hours and it's should open up your breathing a little bit.

PATIENT S164
Yeah.

DOCTOR S164
So we're doing three medications, steroid, antibiotic and inhaler and you're getting a chest x-ray on the way out.

PATIENT S164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S164
You normally see DOCTOR.  He's your primary doctor.

PATIENT S164
Hmm.

DOCTOR S164
And I think it's time you see him again for follow-up.

PATIENT S164
Yeah.

DOCTOR S164
You've had problems like this in the past.  DOCTOR we need to have you back within three or four weeks okay.  Now if you’re home and you're not doing better, the fevers persist and your breathing becomes harder, you got to come back to the Emergency Room.

PATIENT S164
Oh.

DOCTOR S164
Okay.  You can stop at the X-ray today okay.

PATIENT S164
Uh-huh, okay.

DOCTOR S164
And the Pharmacy today to pick up all the medicines I'm putting through.  Probably get your x-rays first to give the Pharmacy time to fill the medications.

PATIENT S164
Okay.

DOCTOR S164
And you'll take the steroids today, the antibiotic today and start using the inhalers today.

PATIENT S164
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR S164
Okay?

PATIENT S164
Okay.

DOCTOR S164
Do you have questions for me?

PATIENT S164
No, no.  All the instructions will be on the bottle, I might forget.

DOCTOR S164
Yep and @@@ don't be shy to have your family help you out okay.

PATIENT S164
Okay.

DOCTOR S164
Cause this is a lot of new medications.

PATIENT S164
Yeah.

DOCTOR S164
The steroid might make your blood sugars go higher so keep checking your blood sugars and if they get high you have to call us and let us know.

PATIENT S164
Okay.

DOCTOR S164
I’m DOCTOR @@@.  Just, I don't @@@ so I'll give you an appointment card.  DOCTOR @@@ doctor.

PATIENT S164

DOCTOR S164
