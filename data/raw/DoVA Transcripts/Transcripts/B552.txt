Okay.  Alright and let me see what the, uh did you have a rectal exam the last time, do you know?  Because one of the things that uh we need to do to evaluate your prostate and you can do it a couple of ways by either measuring uh the level of your prostate-specific antigen, it's something they find in your blood and then also a digital exam where we examine your rectum.

PATIENT B552

DOCTOR B552
If you feel more comfortable with that and uh other than that, you know all your labs, everything looked okay too but this was actually from before.  Okay and then do you check your blood pressure at home?

DOCTOR B552
Alright um take a seat okay.

PATIENT B552
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  38:38  DOCTOR IN:  43:12)

DOCTOR B552
Alright. Everything looks good.  I think that uh one thing that we could do about your blood pressure right now is have you cut down on the amount of salt.

PATIENT B552
Sure.

DOCTOR B552
Do you eat a lot of salt?

PATIENT B552
No.  I never put it on anything.

DOCTOR B552
Do you eat a lot of.

PATIENT B552
But I do eat some beef jerky and stuff like that.

DOCTOR B552
Okay so a lot of processed foods, in fact about 80% of what we take in in terms of salts comes in from processed foods so it's not really what you add during your meals but if you could just try cutting back on.  Do you eat a lot of you know frozen foods?

PATIENT B552
Yep.

DOCTOR B552
So try cutting back on those things and that'll actually help and that'll bring your blood pressure down a little bit too and then we'll see where it is next time I see you.

PATIENT B552
Alright.

DOCTOR B552
Okay.

PATIENT B552
Okay.

DOCTOR B552
And today I'll send up the nurse to give you a tetanus shot, I don't know if she's still around so just give me a second while I find her okay.

PATIENT B552
Okay.

DOCTOR B552
And if not then you can just have that done the next time you come in.

PATIENT B552
Okay.

DOCTOR B552
Alright.  Alright so I don't see her so why don't we just plan on doing that next time.

PATIENT B552
Fine.

DOCTOR B552
Okay.

PATIENT B552
Yep.

DOCTOR B552
And you'll need to take this with you and they'll set up an appointment for you.

PATIENT B552
Okay and okay I was gonna ask about when you want to see me next.

DOCTOR B552
About six months.

PATIENT B552
Six months alright.

DOCTOR B552

DOCTOR B552
Okay.  Alright.

PATIENT B552
Okay.

DOCTOR B552
And then make sure that when you come back you get your labs drawn before.  You'll just stop at the, it's kind of diagonal to here, to get your blood drawn.

PATIENT B552
Oh okay yeah I know where it's at.

DOCTOR B552
Yeah and then uh.

PATIENT B552
