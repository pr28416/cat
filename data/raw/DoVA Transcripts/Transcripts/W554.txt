DOCTOR W554
Good, how you doing?

PATIENT W554
Find.

DOCTOR W554
Yes.  How's everything going?

PATIENT W554
Good, good.

DOCTOR W554
I tried calling you a couple weeks ago, to try to let you know about um the study that you had at Jesse Brown.

PATIENT W554
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR W554
Well I guess, I couldn't get an answer.

PATIENT W554
When did you call?

DOCTOR W554
Um, last week sometime.

PATIENT W554
Probably still in Florida because I got back on Sunday.

DOCTOR W554
Oh okay.  Yeah it was uh the 2nd.

PATIENT W554
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR W554
Last week.  Um, so what they saw on the study was that they didn't, they didn't see any source of bleeding at all.

PATIENT W554
Oh.

DOCTOR W554
Which was good and no, nothing that, I think from their notes it was a little bit of a bad prep, meaning you weren't totally clean.

PATIENT W554
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W554
So they couldn't see everything um but you know the whole reason that we were doing it was because your hemoglobin, cause your red blood cell count was low.

PATIENT W554
Yeah.

DOCTOR W554
And we thought maybe you were bleeding from somewhere.

PATIENT W554
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W554
But the most recent labs we have look great.

PATIENT W554
Yeah.

DOCTOR W554
So I don't think that we need anything else more done, we'll just keep watching it.

PATIENT W554
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W554
To make sure you don't go down again.  Um and if, you know if that starts to happen again then we could probably get the study done again.

PATIENT W554
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W554
