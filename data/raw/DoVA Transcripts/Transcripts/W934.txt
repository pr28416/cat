DOCTOR W934
Do you have an appointment with the urology doctor at any time, let me see @@@.  Cause there's another medication we could add to it, so you take the prostate medicine and then we would add another prostate medicine.  The only thing with doing that is that your blood pressure is kind of low, so @@@ whole lot @@@.

PATIENT W934
@@@.

DOCTOR W934

DOCTOR W934
Right.  Well I may, I know you got your blood work checked yesterday, would you mind getting just one more blood test today?  I want to check your prostate level.

PATIENT W934
@@@.

DOCTOR W934
Cause the last time it was checked was two years ago but I want to see if it got a lot higher um.  Especially if you're having any troubles I think maybe I'm going to talk to DOCTOR but maybe we could start the other medicine and if your blood pressure goes really low or like if you get dizzy or something, you just don't take it.

PATIENT W934
Yeah.

DOCTOR W934
Okay.  I'm going to talk to him about that.

PATIENT W934
Yeah is @@@.

DOCTOR W934
It'd be for having, for the trouble with peeing.

PATIENT W934
But it's don’t hurt or nothing.

DOCTOR W934
No like it's hard to push it out you're saying.

PATIENT W934
No it's not hard it's just uh, @@@ you don't have a good stream.

DOCTOR W934
Uh-huh, yeah it's for that like it helps the urine get out easier.

PATIENT W934
Yeah.

DOCTOR W934
Yeah so I'll talk to him about it and we'll see what he says.

PATIENT W934
Okay.

DOCTOR W934
Are you having a lot of swelling in your legs too?

PATIENT W934
Hmm, yeah @@@.

DOCTOR W934

PATIENT W934

DOCTOR W934
Okay.  Let me uh @@@ do you live by yourself?

PATIENT W934

DOCTOR W934

PATIENT W934

DOCTOR W934
Who do you live with your kids or your wife or?

PATIENT W934

DOCTOR W934
Can I take a look @@@.  Deep breath good.  I'm going to check your back, okay.

PATIENT W934
Okay.

DOCTOR W934
Deep breath.  @@@.  @@@ are you short of breath right now?

PATIENT W934
No.

DOCTOR W934
No okay.  Do you feel.

PATIENT W934
@@@ lungs when I'm sitting down like this.

DOCTOR W934
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W934
I could be driving and I’ll get out of breath @@@ or anything like that @@@.

DOCTOR W934
Okay.

PATIENT W934
Is the reason why I get up and go @@@.

DOCTOR W934
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W934
@@@.  Sometime uh @@@ and I lost a lot of blood, I don't know whether it's cause the nose bleeds a lot.

DOCTOR W934
Right.

PATIENT W934
And I don't know if that has anything to do with this thing or not.

DOCTOR W934
Well and your blood count being low will definitely make you more tired and short of breath.

PATIENT W934
Yeah.

DOCTOR W934
Yeah.  Uh let me see how low your blood count was 8.6 and before it was 8.8 so it @@@ about the same.  Um you know what we could do about the nosebleeds so you are already using the nasal spray right?

PATIENT W934
Yeah I started it again something like @@@ and it bleeds a whole lot.

DOCTOR W934
Do you take your medicine before sleep?

PATIENT W934
Yeah.

DOCTOR W934
Yeah.  I'm gonna order you, just cause I don't see it in the computer anymore, I think it's something you were taking that's not in the computer I want you to try @@@ probably the same thing you were taking and if it is, that’s fine. It's kind of like an oil except it's more like water and you put it in your nose and it kind of protects it from bleeding.  The same thing you're taking but it's not in the computer so I'm not sure.  That's what you're taking?

PATIENT W934
Yeah it's not on there, not on that?

DOCTOR W934
No it's not on here.  So that's why I'm not sure what uh what exactly they gave you.  This one is probably what you're talking about but this is like a cream type of thing.  Yeah so the one I want to give you is like a, oh here it is.

PATIENT W934
So I got two of them I'm not crazy.

DOCTOR W934
Yeah, you're right, you're actually right, it's in here, you're right.  

PATIENT W934
Hmm.

DOCTOR W934
So never mind.  @@@ okay.  You're using it four times a day; they want you to use it four times a day?

PATIENT W934
No I usually use when I'm driving the car and sometimes I use it then when I got a bleed, right after a bleed.

DOCTOR W934
Yeah.

PATIENT W934
See I got a sleeping @@@ that I'll put on, @@@.

DOCTOR W934
Are you using @@@.

PATIENT W934
Sometimes my nose will start bleeding when I'm asleep and um, it's lucky that when it starts coming down.

DOCTOR W934
@@@.

PATIENT W934
It wakes me up.

DOCTOR W934
@@@.  Yeah so you need the Coumadin cause we don't want you to get a stroke so, it's kind of a cost benefit type of thing.  If we stop the Coumadin the nosebleeds would stop but then you could have a stroke or something.

PATIENT W934
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR W934
@@@.

PATIENT W934
And the first time I have a slight headache and then I'm just tired you know.

DOCTOR W934
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W934
I don't know whether that has anything to do with it or not.

DOCTOR W934
It's probably everybody over the age of like 10 starts getting headaches, it’s probably one of those. Are you still using your CPAP?

PATIENT W934
Huh?

DOCTOR W934
CPAP machine?  Are you still using it at night?  Oh they just did it yesterday, your sleep study.

PATIENT W934
Yeah I had that.

DOCTOR W934
Did they tell you that you needed a machine?

PATIENT W934
That I need what?

DOCTOR W934
Like a CPAP machine, like the machine when you sleep?

PATIENT W934
Uh oh,yeah, they told me uh yeah that's what I got.

DOCTOR W934
You got one of those?

PATIENT W934
Yeah.

DOCTOR W934
Okay good and you’re still using it?

PATIENT W934
Yeah I had the thing that go up in your nose.

DOCTOR W934
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W934
But uh for the last week I went up there and they gave me uh the one you know it don't go in your nose, it goes over your nose.

DOCTOR W934
Right, right.

PATIENT W934
So I got that one.

DOCTOR W934
You've been using that?

PATIENT W934
Yeah but I haven’t used it three or four, two or three days.

DOCTOR W934
Uh-huh.

PATIENT W934
Because of the nosebleeds.

DOCTOR W934
Oh yeah.  So let me talk to my boss to see if he might have any ideas okay.  See if we can do anything about it.

PATIENT W934
Alright.

DOCTOR W934
Alright, I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  126:10  DOCTOR IN:  133:31)

DOCTOR W934
Alright so, for the nosebleeds, he didn't have any ideas either.  The only thing we could think of is that maybe, have you ever been to a nose doctor, like an ENT doctor where they take a camera and look in your nose and see?

PATIENT W934
No, no more than the doctors here looked at me.

DOCTOR W934
Alright so we'll uh, so, keep doing what you’re doing with the sprays and all that and in the meantime we want to get you to see the ENT doctor, the Ear, Nose and Throat doctors and they can just see if there's anything - cause they're the experts of the nose and they can just take a really good look inside and see if there's anything that's bleeding or some other changes, okay.

PATIENT W934
Okay.

DOCTOR W934
And then I'm going to put that here for you know in one week or in one to two weeks.

PATIENT W934
Okay.

DOCTOR W934
They'll schedule it for you right out front there and I'll put it in the computer too.  And then for the um, you know the urinary symptoms you're having, we can actually go up on the tamsulosin that you're taking the 5 mg pills.

PATIENT W934
What.

DOCTOR W934
You could go up to 10 so you'd take two pills instead of just one and I'll change it in the computer um it's this medicine right here.

PATIENT W934
Okay.

DOCTOR W934
The tamsulosin.

PATIENT W934
Alright.

DOCTOR W934
Instead of taking 5 mg take the 10 mg.

PATIENT W934
Okay take two.

DOCTOR W934
Take two.

PATIENT W934
Okay.

DOCTOR W934
Yeah.  @@@ it’s the prostate medicine okay.

PATIENT W934
Right.

DOCTOR W934
Do you get your medicines mailed to you or do you pick them up here?

PATIENT W934
Uh I get it mailed to me.

DOCTOR W934
Mailed to you.

PATIENT W934
Some of it I pick up at the Pharmacy.  If I need to pick it up, I pick it up but if not they mail it.

DOCTOR W934
Okay.  So, it’s up to you. If you have some of these left over you can just take two pills and I'll get them mailed to you and then you'll take the 10 mg.

PATIENT W934
Oh okay.

DOCTOR W934
Or if you want to just pick it up you can.

PATIENT W934
Okay.  Do which one you want.

DOCTOR W934
Well which do you want?

PATIENT W934
A you can have them mail it.

DOCTOR W934
Okay.  So in the meantime take two of them tonight.

PATIENT W934
You @@@.  Is it a week to two weeks?

DOCTOR W934
Hopefully you'll get the ENT appointment the nose doctor appointment.

PATIENT W934
Hmm.

DOCTOR W934
Then you can come see me in three months.  But @@@ if you want to see me earlier like one month?

PATIENT W934
Yeah one month that way uh.

DOCTOR W934
Yeah you could do that, we could do one month and then see the nose doctors and we'll go over your next @@@.

PATIENT W934
Okay.

DOCTOR W934
Okay.

PATIENT W934
They're going to be giving me the phone number for that right?

DOCTOR W934
Yeah, they should.  When you go out front ask them, give them this piece of paper.

PATIENT W934
