Okay.

PATIENT O831

Thank you.

DOCTOR O831
Um I want to have to be honest we have some um uh, we have all your records from Elgin and I have a little bit of idea of what's been going on with you.  I'm just gonna ask you a couple of questions and get to know you a little bit.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.  Um first of all, is everything, starting in the last couple of weeks, in general how do you feel?

Good.

Uh my feet have been exceptionally stiff in my ankles and feet.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.

PATIENT O831
And uh, between my shoulder blades and my lower back has been bothering me quite a bit too.

DOCTOR O831
What's been going on with that?

PATIENT O831

DOCTOR O831
So you've had diabetes for ten years?

DOCTOR O831
And @@@ diet.

PATIENT O831
Blood sugar has been fabulous lately.

DOCTOR O831
Yeah it looks like your hemoglobin A1c, do you know what you're hemoglobin A1c is?

PATIENT O831
No.

DOCTOR O831
That is a number based on a medical term for your average blood sugars at home.  Kind of like a trick for the doctors to see how you've been doing every month.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
And your number is excellent.  Which means that you're entirely correct.  It means that what you're saying, it's not that we don't believe you but.

PATIENT O831
Well I got my home numbers with me.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.

PATIENT O831
@@@.

DOCTOR O831
Well what I mean is I can tell they're good, well that's good.  Um.  Let's see here um do you have any eye problems from the diabetes?

PATIENT O831
No.

DOCTOR O831
When was the last time you saw the eye doctor?

PATIENT O831
Uh just a few months ago, four or five months ago.

DOCTOR O831
That was at Elgin?

PATIENT O831
No, I don't go out there at Elgin.

DOCTOR O831
Okay so where did you go?

And you take three tablets of Depakote once a day at bedtime?

PATIENT O831
Right.

DOCTOR O831
Okay and is that like a steady dose for you?

PATIENT O831
I'm sorry what.

DOCTOR O831
Has that been a pretty steady dose for you?

PATIENT O831
Yeah, it's been working out pretty good.

DOCTOR O831
And who manages that?

PATIENT O831
DOCTOR.

DOCTOR O831
Here?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
I think I know DOCTOR.  That's at Hines right?

DOCTOR O831
Ah, December 2nd.  Oh you're also on trazodone too.

PATIENT O831
Right.

DOCTOR O831
Okay, how long have you been on those medications for?

PATIENT O831
Quite a while.

DOCTOR O831
How long ago did you get diagnosed?

PATIENT O831
Oh I think I was diagnosed in 1984.

DOCTOR O831
When was the last time you had period where your disease was uncontrolled in your opinion?

PATIENT O831
Um, well I'm pretty high these days.  I've been checking it uh on the high side.

DOCTOR O831
How do you notice those things?

PATIENT O831
Well, I'm doing things that I wouldn't normally do.  Building a website, volunteering.  I may be taking on more than I can chew.

DOCTOR O831
What are some of the strategies to try to help with that?

PATIENT O831
Take my time and slow down.  Think about what I'm doing.  Put things around me and instead of concentrating my website I try and take walks and spend time with family and try and make new friends.

DOCTOR O831
Well it sounds like what you're describing right now, and I apologize, going back and forth.

PATIENT O831
That's alright.

DOCTOR O831
Is uh.

PATIENT O831
I know you computer operators.

DOCTOR O831
It sounds like you have a fair amount of insight into sort of how you feel.

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Which is good, not all people can do that.  Even people who are.

PATIENT O831
I have a handle on myself these days, I really do.

DOCTOR O831
I think I get that feeling.  I'm not perfect, in terms of knowing, but my gut is that you kind of know um how things are going.  Um okay.  Let's talk a little bit about your lungs.  Now you have, it looks like emphysema.

PATIENT O831
Emphysema, COPD.

DOCTOR O831
@@@ right?

PATIENT O831
60% of my lungs are gone supposedly.

DOCTOR O831
Did you have asthma as a child?

PATIENT O831
No.  I cut back dramatically on my smoking now.  I have a nurse from Home Bound that visits me once a week and she's got me cutting back on my smoking.

DOCTOR O831
How many packs a day?

PATIENT O831
I'm down to one pack a day now and a couple of cigars.

DOCTOR O831
Are you interested in quitting?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Okay well some people aren't, I have to ask.

PATIENT O831
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR O831
Okay, but what are some reasons you want to quit?

PATIENT O831
I want to cut down, cut back.  I don't know if I'll ever be able to quit totally but I'm gonna try.

DOCTOR O831
Well I think you can.  I am an optimist if it's what you want to do.  Um and uh I think we can talk about maybe how we can help you.  Now I want to talk about your pancreas.

PATIENT O831
That's what I'm getting tested for right?

DOCTOR O831
Well that's what I'm gonna ask you, what do you know about that?

PATIENT O831
Uh, well they said there's a count, but I don't know what it is, is 6, @@@ and they're gonna take a test, go up my butt and find out whether or not I got cancer or not.

DOCTOR O831
So are you seeing?

PATIENT O831
If it's on my pancreas @@@ right?

DOCTOR O831
Well, yeah I'm curious which doctor is managing that pretty sure with DOCTOR, you were in the GI Clinic?

PATIENT O831
Huh?

DOCTOR O831
Who, what doctor recommended like, who uh?

PATIENT O831
Urologist.

DOCTOR O831
That's your prostate.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
I think you're talking about your prostate.  That's when they got you on the @@@ and the finasteride.

PATIENT O831
They just changed my medication, I just got it in the mail today and I haven't had a chance to look at it.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.  But you had a biopsy of your pancreas @@@.  That looked like they were concerned you had a tumor but it looks like.

PATIENT O831
Right they said, I had surgery yeah.

DOCTOR O831
And they thought it was just a cyst is that correct?

PATIENT O831
They said it was benign.

DOCTOR O831
Good, okay.  Now did you also have something that you know about called chronic pancreatitis?  Does that sound familiar?

PATIENT O831
Nobody ever told me that.

DOCTOR O831
Well you might not, I was just curious.  Um have you ever taken medications for your pancreas?

PATIENT O831
My prostate not my pancreas.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.  

PATIENT O831
I don't know the difference between the two. (Laughs)

DOCTOR O831
That's okay.

PATIENT O831
@@@ peas in my pods.

DOCTOR O831
Right.  Let's see here.  So they cut your, I think they cut your pancreas let's see.  Usually the first time I see you, it takes me a little longer because I got to read all your notes.

PATIENT O831
No, there's a lot of them on there.

DOCTOR O831
Yeah I know I appreciate your patience with me.  Have you ever taken any supplements for your pancreas @@@?  No okay.

PATIENT O831
No my pancreas is a new subject to me.

DOCTOR O831
Well only because you know you had this um.

PATIENT O831
So the urologist is treating me for something now.

DOCTOR O831
Right that's your prostate.

PATIENT O831
That's my prostate.

DOCTOR O831
Your prostate yes.

PATIENT O831
@@@.

DOCTOR O831
So you were treated @@@.

PATIENT O831
The pancreas is a whole new subject to me.

DOCTOR O831
Right.

PATIENT O831
I don't know what you're talking about.

DOCTOR O831
No I think your pancreas is fine but you had surgery in 2008 which was a pretty big surgery.

PATIENT O831
Right.

DOCTOR O831
So I'm getting more of your history to make sure I don't miss anything.  @@@ we talked now, you're smoking close to a pack per day.  Did you smoke your whole life?

PATIENT O831
Yeah since I was 14.

DOCTOR O831
Okay, so 40 years.  And you used to smoke two packs per day?

PATIENT O831
Three.
DOCTOR O831
About three, when did you cut back?

PATIENT O831
Uh about a week ago.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.  Tell me about your alcohol drinking history.

PATIENT O831
Uh I got two DUIs.  I was more than a social drinker and.

DOCTOR O831
Have you ever been admitted for alcohol withdrawals?

PATIENT O831
I went to classes for alcohol.  I was never admitted for withdrawals.  I never, uh @@@.

DOCTOR O831
When was the last time?

PATIENT O831
Yesterday I had a glass of wine and tonight Iâ€™ll have a glass of wine.

DOCTOR O831
Do you think you drink too much?

PATIENT O831
No.  I think because it's healthy for you.

DOCTOR O831
What kind of work do you do in the past?

PATIENT O831
I work for @@@ in @@@ network administrator.

DOCTOR O831
Do you still do that or?

PATIENT O831
No I'm retired.  I got an early retirement.

DOCTOR O831
Okay, who do you live with at home?

PATIENT O831
I live by myself.  My daughter lives downstairs in a basement apartment.

DOCTOR O831
Okay so you have one daughter, any other children?

PATIENT O831
Two girls and a boy in the middle.

DOCTOR O831
Are your parents alive?

PATIENT O831
No.  They've been gone a long time.

DOCTOR O831
What happened with their health.

PATIENT O831
Uh my dad died from lung disorders, emphysema and my mom died of breast cancer.

DOCTOR O831
How old was she?

PATIENT O831
55.

DOCTOR O831
Any heart disease in your family?

PATIENT O831
No.

DOCTOR O831
Any cancers in the family?  Oh the breast cancer that's right.

PATIENT O831
Breast cancer and my brother has prostate cancer.

DOCTOR O831
How old is he?

PATIENT O831
Five years older than me, 69.

DOCTOR O831
When he was diagnosed with prostate cancer?

PATIENT O831
When?

DOCTOR O831
Yeah.

PATIENT O831
Uh maybe three years ago.

DOCTOR O831
So, we'll go through all the medications that came up okay. 

PATIENT O831
Uh don't ask me.

DOCTOR O831
You donâ€™t know what they are?

PATIENT O831
I don't know them by name, I know them by bottles.  @@@.

DOCTOR O831
Well I know them by name and you know them by bottles so I'm going to try to find some common ground.  Cause I have all your names here okay, so I know what you're supposed to be.  Do you take everything that we send you?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.  I take fish oil and vitamin C and a vitamin supplement too.

DOCTOR O831
Have you ever had a colonoscopy?

PATIENT O831
I'm due for one.

DOCTOR O831
Have you ever had one?

PATIENT O831
No.  She was schedule with me the last time I saw her but she didn't.

DOCTOR O831
Well, do you know why we do then?

PATIENT O831
For polyps or something?

DOCTOR O831
Yeah we look for cancer.

PATIENT O831
Hmm.

DOCTOR O831
There are two different ways of screening for colon cancer either one can tell us if you have @@@ disease @@@.  Colonoscopy is an invasive procedure okay.  We put you under, we put to sleep, we put a camera up the rear end and we go looking for polyps @@@.  People who are otherwise healthy at the age of 63, I generally think it's probably a better idea.  The problem is your lungs aren't doing so hot with your emphysema as you can imagine.

PATIENT O831
Hmm.

DOCTOR O831
And I think you're at a higher risk for the procedure so what that means is I'm not sure the best candidate for that procedure.

PATIENT O831
DOCTOR said it was a simple procedure where they just give me some local anesthetic or something, maybe she was talking about something else.

DOCTOR O831
I think it was something else.  This isn't local anesthetic.  They give you a medication to kind of make you twilight okay.

PATIENT O831
@@@.

DOCTOR O831
@@@.  Now you know, it's really there's no magic @@@.  I'm just telling you how it is okay.  Um the other option is we send you home with cards that check your stool, because you can't always see blood in your stool.  So we send you home with cards that you send in to the lab and we check your stool for blood and then we do a colonoscopy if you have blood.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
So here, it's actually kind of gross.

PATIENT O831
Yeah I know, I've done it before.

DOCTOR O831
You send them in and then if they're positive.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
But honestly, I feel like it's probably your best option okay.  Um now do you still have the urine problems?

PATIENT O831
Yeah I got a bag on.

DOCTOR O831
Oh you got a bag?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Permanently?

PATIENT O831
No it's only supposed to be on for a week but I extended it for a week so it's been going, I still don't feel like I have control yet.

DOCTOR O831
Do you ever take it out at home or not?

PATIENT O831
No.

DOCTOR O831
When is your next appointment with them?

PATIENT O831
On the 12th.

DOCTOR O831
Does the bag look clean and clear or is it cloudy.

PATIENT O831
Yeah it's clear.

DOCTOR O831
But you know kind of what to look for right?

PATIENT O831
Right I've had one before.

DOCTOR O831
Any weight loss?

PATIENT O831
Uh a little bit.

DOCTOR O831
How much weight have you lost?

PATIENT O831
Maybe 10 pounds in three months but I'm trying to lose the weight.  I want to get rid of this gut @@@ arms.

DOCTOR O831
Good for you.  Well here's your weight in the last six months.  Looks like you were at 172, you worked your way down to 162, today we have you at 167.

PATIENT O831
Yeah I don't know why that is.

DOCTOR O831
Did you have everything on when they weighed you?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.

PATIENT O831
I didn't have no jacket on but still 167, I only weighed 160 before.

DOCTOR O831
The key is to have always the same scale though.  Okay, so how often do you take your inhalers?

PATIENT O831
Um twice a day.  The albuterol I take four times a day if not more.

DOCTOR O831
Okay and you also get the formoterol twice a day?

PATIENT O831
Right.

DOCTOR O831
Do you think that helps you?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.  The finasteride for your cough just got mailed out to you and then they increased your Citron.  Trazodone, thiamine, terazosin, the Bactrim is an old one; you're not still on antibiotics right?

PATIENT O831
No.

DOCTOR O831
And you take the metformin every day?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.  Good.  Okay.  We're almost done, I just need to examine you and then we'll get you on your way okay.  I just want to make sure I've got a good idea of who you are and I think we're getting there.

PATIENT O831
Yep.

DOCTOR O831
Alright.  

PATIENT O831
I'm a funny old man.

DOCTOR O831
Yeah but you know you're smart man, you know something.

PATIENT O831
You know how I got smart?

DOCTOR O831
How?

PATIENT O831
Listen to John Text, did you ever hear of him?

DOCTOR O831
Yeah but I've never heard that answer before.

PATIENT O831
Yeah.  He made me the smartest one in the room.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.

PATIENT O831
I've been eating better and it makes me feel better.

DOCTOR O831
I'll have you sit up here for me.  Actually this is too high, @@@.  I'll lift up the back of your shirt here.  Yeah I think you're pretty up-to-date, you're getting pretty good care.  I was looking at your labs, they all look pretty up-to-date.

PATIENT O831
The nurse takes my vitals every week.

DOCTOR O831
What's that?

PATIENT O831
The nurse takes my vitals every week.

DOCTOR O831
Yeah no their good.

PATIENT O831
And they're good.

DOCTOR O831
Yeah, deep breath, let it out and in.  Do you @@@?

PATIENT O831
Yes.

DOCTOR O831
Any shortness of breath?  You take albuterol.

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Sometimes stable, getting worse, getting better?

PATIENT O831
I got to quit.

DOCTOR O831
You don't sound good.

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Have you ever tried  nicotine replacement - the patch?

PATIENT O831
I have a habit, it's a profile.  I know @@@.  It's just a lousy habit that I have.  I tried gum and I tried the pill and I tried @@@.

DOCTOR O831
@@@.

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
People, it doesn't hurt them @@@ it might be worth a shot.

PATIENT O831
I could try it.

DOCTOR O831
What date do you want to try to quit, do you have a quit date?

PATIENT O831
It was January 1st.

DOCTOR O831
Hereâ€™s the thing, .

PATIENT O831
@@@.

DOCTOR O831
Who do you see, the lung doctor?

PATIENT O831
@@@ yeah.  @@@.

DOCTOR O831
Now have you got swelling in your legs?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
How long?

PATIENT O831
I got neuropathy.

DOCTOR O831
Thatâ€™s different. Swelling too?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Which ones different?

PATIENT O831
The right looks worse than the left one.  This ones a little bigger.  That hurts.

DOCTOR O831
Push up, pull back, push up, pull back, pull back, relax your leg.  I'm going to have you take your shoes and socks off; we got to check your nerves okay.

PATIENT O831
I was wondering can I get orthopedic shoes?

DOCTOR O831
Don't see you see the podiatrist already?

PATIENT O831
Podiatrist?  @@@.

DOCTOR O831
They're the ones; they have to fit you for one.  Let's see the last time you saw Podiatry, you saw them in October.

PATIENT O831
â€˜Cuz I'm lucky that these shoes fit me now.  Considering how swollen my feet are.  I got a pair of sandals that barely fit me.  So how long you been practicing?

DOCTOR O831
My third year as a resident. When did you get these . . .

PATIENT O831
Good.

DOCTOR O831
Okay now let me get these us.  Now you have scheduled ultrasounds of your legs, and they didnâ€™t get done. You need to get them.  They'll need to scan your legs.

PATIENT O831
I never got an appointment.

DOCTOR O831
Have you ever had an ultrasound done on your legs?

PATIENT O831
In my lifetime I have yeah, not lately.

DOCTOR O831
Year ago?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Have you ever had an ultrasound of your heart?

PATIENT O831
I had a heart scan.

DOCTOR O831
Here?

PATIENT O831
No.  Outside.  I had the results, I had them print them out if I can find them, email them to you.

DOCTOR O831
Close your eyes, say yes every time you feel something.

PATIENT O831
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

DOCTOR O831
Do you know who wanted to scan you legs cause there's all sorts of orders in the computer about scanning your legs.  Do you remember any of this? They might not have told you.  Vascular lab ordered by DOCTOR.

PATIENT O831
Oh I saw the vascular doctor but I didn't have, I got another appointment coming up on the 12th.  I don't know what that's for.  If it's for a scan or it's for a follow-up visit.

DOCTOR O831
Oh they wanted to see if you had cellulitis.  Well I'm going to â€“ I agree with - What we do is we ultrasound your legs to make sure that you don't have a DVT.  A DVT is a blood clot.

PATIENT O831
Right.

DOCTOR O831
Do you snore at night?

PATIENT O831
Not that I know of.

DOCTOR O831
@@@ heart disease right?

PATIENT O831
No.

DOCTOR O831
Here we go.  I'll have you put your shoes and socks back on and I'm going to go talk to my attending and I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT: 42:06  DOCTOR IN:  52:57)

DOCTOR O831
Alright one more thing okay.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
Page real quick.  (doctor answering a page)  That was the Vascular Lab.  What we want to do is really easy, non-invasive is we want to get um an ultrasound of your legs to make sure there's not a clot on this side and then also to check your blood pressure at different points to make sure that you're getting enough blood pressure.
 
PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
Okay um.  That's number one.  Number two your diabetes is very well controlled, you told me and we confirmed.  There could be some side effects with other diabetes medications so you're on a pretty big dose of metformin and with the weight loss that you've had.  I want to cut it in half.  

PATIENT O831
I was thinking about doing that yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Well good that means on day one you and I are on the same page.

PATIENT O831
Hmm.

DOCTOR O831
We'll cut in half, you're going to physically cut that pill in half, I'm going to change it in the computer.

PATIENT O831
I take two pills a day.

DOCTOR O831
Uh.

PATIENT O831
I take one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

DOCTOR O831
Oh right yeah, so you're gonna take a half a pill twice a day.

PATIENT O831
Oh okay.  I hate cutting pills.

DOCTOR O831
Well weâ€™ll save you some money.

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
We'll say you cut in half; um I don't think you need this much.  We'll get the ultrasound of your legs.  The other thing that once in a while that can cause some swelling in your legs is at one time you had an ultrasound.

PATIENT O831
Can't I just take it once a day rather than in two halves?

DOCTOR O831
Um, for yeah.  The way the drug works, the way it stays in your body, it makes more sense to take it twice a day.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
It's also a lower dose so it won't be as big of a risk to your kidneys.  The problem is you have a much, here's why we're doing it, your lung disease causes your lungs not to get rid of acid in your body as well.  You retain what we call carbon dioxide which is an acid.  Metformin can affect your kidneys and do the same thing so you have a potential for some badness going on there but we don't want metformin to run into trouble with your kidneys okay.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
That's why for you you're a little special in that you have not just the diabetes but also the lung disease.  I don't want too high of a dose of metformin.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
And as the kidneys, you know if they struggle we're gonna have to cut down further.

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Um in addition to the ultrasound of your legs I want to get an ultrasound of your heart.  It's a different department okay. It's called an echocardiogram.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
Similarly non-invasive.  They put some gel on your heart, like a pregnant woman looking at a baby, but their looking at your the beating of your heart.

PATIENT O831
Alright, okay.

DOCTOR O831
We'll schedule it.  I'm going to put that in for you.

PATIENT O831
Alright.

DOCTOR O831
That was, the ultrasound of the leg that was her who just called me, that's who paged me.  You already have an appointment so if you didn't get it in the mail yet, I'm gonna tell you the date.

PATIENT O831
What is it?

DOCTOR O831
Hold on, I'm retrieving.  January 12th 2:00 p.m.

PATIENT O831
I have that date.

DOCTOR O831
Okay, good.  Well that's good.

PATIENT O831
I got three appointments that day.

DOCTOR O831
Yeah you have PM&R, Urology and Vascular Lab.  You have all of those already.

PATIENT O831
Right.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.  So that's good.  So we'll plan on um uh following up on those results, doing the ultrasound of your heart, cut the metformin in half.  Now are you interested in me giving you the patch?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Good.  How much do you smoke?  Oh is it a pack a day?

PATIENT O831
No I'd say a pack and a half and three cigars.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.

PATIENT O831
I'm smoking all day you know.  It's just the cigars last a long time.

DOCTOR O831
Well if you quit you know you have to quit.  You have to quit everything right?

PATIENT O831
Yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Do you want me to mail it or do you want to pick it up at the window?

PATIENT O831
Mail them.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.  What I'm gonna do is I'm mailing you two different types of patches okay.  I'm mailing you the medium dose for a person who smokes fairly heavily like yourself, the 14 mg nicotine patches, that's like the medium dose and you're on that.  So what day do you think you're gonna quit?

PATIENT O831
Well I won't get it for another ten days you know.

DOCTOR O831
It's always good to schedule a date so that you're looking ahead.

PATIENT O831
My birthday is January 26th.

DOCTOR O831
Perfect, I like that.  So it will be there by then.  So you're gonna quit on your birthday.  I'm going to give you two weeks of the high dose and then two weeks of the low dose so obviously once you've finished the two weeks of the high dose and I have confidence you're still gonna be not smoking you're going to go down to the low dose.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
So four weeks and I'll give you one refill on the low dose so you can extend the patch out to six weeks if you think it's gonna help you.

PATIENT O831
Say that again.

DOCTOR O831
So it's two weeks of the high dose and then two weeks of the low dose and then I'll give you one refill if you want another two weeks of the low dose.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
You might not think and I agree with you, you might have @@@ nicotine but it has a psychological affect on you that's why it helps to be on the patch.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
So it's going to increase the likelihood of you succeeding by using this.  Your lungs are in the battle for your life so.  The day you quit the next week you're going to be coughing a lot more, that's the nature of the beast.  It takes a week to cough all that stuff up okay.

PATIENT O831
Excuse me.

DOCTOR O831
Um.  I don't necessarily â€“ how I can see you back here in about three months and we'll go over everything okay.

PATIENT O831
Alright.

DOCTOR O831
And before that appointment in three months I'll have you get some lab work done here okay.

PATIENT O831
Again?

DOCTOR O831
You don't need it today, I mean in three months or so.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
Yeah I'm not gonna; I won't make you a pinball or whatever you call it.  Yeah we need to check your kidney function and I'm going to check your prostate blood level that your urologist checked okay and let's see what else.  I'm gonna check how your diabetes is doing cause we're pulling back on the metformin and I don't need to check your cholesterol because it was just checked and it was normal okay.

PATIENT O831
Alright.  There's a lot going on on me isn't there.

DOCTOR O831
There is but you know what I'm confident that it's all pretty stable.  The biggest problem are your lungs and that's why you're gonna quit smoking right.

PATIENT O831
Hey.  I sent out an e-mail that I was quitting January 1 and I heard a response from everybody yeah.

DOCTOR O831
Here's the deal though okay.  I give you a lot of credit for trying.  Because we're stubborn and don't want to try.  You know the average time it takes to quit smoking it takes seven attempts.

PATIENT O831
That's what my lung guy says.  They quit every Monday.

DOCTOR O831
So @@@.

PATIENT O831
My nurse that visits me every Monday @@@.

DOCTOR O831
No you got it together.  You know what's going on with your health, you're a smart guy, I think you're gonna do this and the other thing I tell people the truth and I just met you for the first time but I think I.

PATIENT O831
I need that drug list.

DOCTOR O831
Okay.

PATIENT O831
Cause my nurse.

DOCTOR O831
I'm gonna say follow up with me in three months, follow up with labs in three months so you'll come in the day you see me, come in for the lab work.  That won't be a fasting work.

PATIENT O831
Come in the same day for the lab test.

DOCTOR O831
Yeah, we'll see you at 2:00 come in at lunch time okay.

PATIENT O831
Okay.

DOCTOR O831
Come into the lab at 1:00 and then come see me.  You don't need to be fasting for this next one okay.  I think you know the metformin dose change everything else is up-to-date.  You keep these.  The ultrasound of your legs, the ultrasound of your heart and I think we're in good shape and I'll send out the nicotine patches your way okay.  That's for you and you can check out up front.  They're going to reschedule your appointment to see me in three months and the lab you don't need an appointment okay.  @@@ to get the labs done okay.

PATIENT O831
Yeah before I forget.

DOCTOR O831

PATIENT O831
