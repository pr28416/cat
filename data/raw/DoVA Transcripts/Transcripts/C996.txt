DOCTOR C996
How are things going for you?

PATIENT C996
Pretty good.  I got my little quirks.

Yeah.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.  Pain here and there.

DOCTOR C996
Any problems?  Want to talk about today, just following up?

PATIENT C996
No, no big problems, except every so often my damn ankle hurts right here.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah.

PATIENT C996
Sore as hell.

DOCTOR C996
What do you do when it hurts?  Like what makes it hurt?

PATIENT C996
I don't know it just comes and goes.

PATIENT C996
Not that I can remember.

DOCTOR C996
Did you do any exercise recently?

SECOND PERSON C996
Only working around the house.

DOCTOR C996
Okay, walking around.  I mean the only thing we kind of do for that, do you take anything for it to help?

PATIENT C996
Uh well I got some medicine Naproxen and that @@@.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah probably Naproxen.

PATIENT C996
Yeah that and my wife, she rubs it and massages it with a liniment, like a liniment and it gets better.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah.  You probably just have some strain on the ligaments and everything.

PATIENT C996
Right it's just like a little pain that comes.

DOCTOR C996
It comes up too?

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
It's probably a little strain in the muscle.  Does it seem to be on the outside?

PATIENT C996
Yeah like right, right in here.

DOCTOR C996
There's a kind of strain where you're pushing your down and you're using these muscles.

PATIENT C996
Oh.

DOCTOR C996
And you’re using the muscles on the outside of the ankle.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
Pushing down like that so.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
The one thing to do is just you know keep exercising the ankle movement around.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
And don't overwork it too much.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
Heating pads and stuff will help with that.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
Well and I mean and I'll take a look at it just to make sure there's nothing swollen in there or anything.

SECOND PERSON C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
Um, anything else?  Have you been checking your sugars?

PATIENT C996
Yeah.  I'm in that study you know.

DOCTOR C996
Oh right yeah.

PATIENT C996
Calling it in three times a week.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.  Um how do they look at home?

SECOND PERSON C996
They look good.  @@@.

DOCTOR C996
So when do you check them?

PATIENT C996
Uh in the mornings and before I eat.

DOCTOR C996
What is it usually?

PATIENT C996
Uh it depends on if I’ve been naughty at night.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah and in the morning?

PATIENT C996
124, 27 you know.

DOCTOR C996
So 120s that's pretty good.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
Any low ones?

PATIENT C996
Uh in the morning no.  I've had a few high ones like in the 150 range.

DOCTOR C996
That's still not too bad so that's good.

PATIENT C996
But after I take the medicine you know it's back to 130, 12 goes down to like 116, 107.

DOCTOR C996
So it's pretty good.  So you're keeping in a good range and how about the blood pressure?

PATIENT C996
Uh blood pressures range from like 130 you know, the bottom like 78 and heart rate, the heart rate always seems a little high.

DOCTOR C996
@@@.

PATIENT C996
Yeah about 93, 98, one time 106.

DOCTOR C996
Any reason why it's so fast?

PATIENT C996
You mean.

DOCTOR C996
No chest pain, shortness of breath?

SECOND PERSON C996
No not really.  

PATIENT C996
It usually go up a little when I do my inhaler you know.

DOCTOR C996
Okay that's why.  The inhaler makes it a little fast that makes sense yeah.

PATIENT C996
Right.  I get a little jittery.

DOCTOR C996
It speeds it up.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
It @@@ should.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
Alright.  So all the meds here, you're still taking the metformin?

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
And the lisinopril, amlodipine.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
Niacin?

PATIENT C996
Yeah.  I'm taking every damn thing.

DOCTOR C996
We gave you more than enough so.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
That’s awesome, the blood pressure is good today.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
Really well-controlled, better than even before.  Pulse is high still.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
We'll recheck that.  Okay.  How is that knee?

PATIENT C996
Uh it's doing pretty good.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.

PATIENT C996
Yeah, seems like it leaves one area and go into another area.  @@@ and that wasn't a normal thing it's, just had a pain and that's normal but shit what can you do?  @@@.  

DOCTOR C996
Well I know we tested a bunch of labs last time.

PATIENT C996
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR C996
And I remember that they all came back normal so @@@.

PATIENT C996
Didn't I get an x-ray or something?

DOCTOR C996
You did like x-ray and that was okay.  Your iron was okay, we checked that.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
And you know everything else here, your thyroid looks okay so I don't think there's any like any cause for, so you probably did something like first @@@ and it happens sometimes you don't even.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
So today there's nothing prominent.  When was the last time you saw the eye doctor?  In October?  Is that right?

PATIENT C996
I think so.  Yeah that's it.

DOCTOR C996
And your level was not too bad.  Your A1c level was good, it was 7.2.  Now I want it below 7.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
But that's not bad.

PATIENT C996
What's that fellow when I called in for my shoes?

DOCTOR C996
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C996
They asked me did I know my A1c.

DOCTOR C996
Oh they asked you, that's the one you want to know.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
7.2 so.

PATIENT C996
7.2 and they want it below 6 right?

DOCTOR C996
Well closer to, probably under 6.5 would be best.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
I'd be happy to get you under 7. To be honest.

PATIENT C996
Yeah okay.

DOCTOR C996
So I mean, you're almost there and you're not on a ton of meds so.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
I mean we could probably let it go up a little bit.  I mean I think the way your sugars are looking and how's the diet and exercise doing?

SECOND PERSON C996
Good.

PATEITN C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah so you been losing weight, the same.

SECOND PERSON C996

DOCTOR C996
Pretty good.  So losing a little?

SECOND PERSON C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
Pretty similar to last time.

PATIENT C996
I've stopped eating a lot.

DOCTOR C996
Okay. Your diet’s been good at least.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.  Cause I got a sensitive tooth right there.

DOCTOR C996
So that's how it's working?

PATIENT C996
Yeah I got do another @@@.  Sometimes I tell you I can't eat nothing.

DOCTOR C996
Oh all the good stuff you can't eat.

PATIENT C996
Yeah, like fried chicken, cause that's hard.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah, it hurts too much.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah okay.

PATIENT C996
Go ahead.

DOCTOR C996
Oh no just stay where you're at.

SECOND PERSON C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
Eat today already?

PATIENT C996
Yeah I ate.  I went for blood work.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.  So did they check your cholesterol?

PATIENT C996
Right yeah did the blood work.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.

PATIENT C996
They called me and told me to come in and check my @@@.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.  It should be here.

PATIENT C996
@@@.

DOCTOR C996
It's still a little high.

PATIENT C996
Oh they did it already?

DOCTOR C996
Yep.  So we might need to uh, let's see.  Are you taking the um simvastatin, you're taking it?

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
And you're taking the niacin.

PATIENT C996
Niacin.  I may be slacking on that one a little bit.

DOCTOR C996
Okay try and take it daily so I don't have to.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

SECOND PERSON C996
One time when I took that stuff.

DOCTOR C996
Uh-huh.

SECOND PERSON C996
And I got me burning and burning and my skin's on fire.

DOCTOR C996
You can take something for that.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
You can take a Benadryl or using an aspirin before you take it.

SECOND PERSON C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
So you take aspirin anyway right?

SECOND PERSON C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
Baby aspirin at night like when you're going to take the niacin.  So take the aspirin a little before you take that pill.

PATIENT C996
Oh okay, like 81 mg.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah.

SECOND PERSON C996
Oh okay.

DOCTOR C996
So if you take that before it should help. So when you take the aspirin.

PATIENT C996
That scared the shit out of me.

PATIENT C996
Right and I like to know, hearing these reports about this is outside a little bit of the norm, about testosterone.

DOCTOR C996
Yes.

PATIENT C996
So um now um I was been on the computer and found that.  Like I don't seem like I don't want my, you have to want desire for sex or whatever.

DOCTOR C996
Uh-huh.

PATIENT C996
And that's one of the reason low testosterone.

DOCTOR C996
Right.

PATIENT C996
Is there a test for that?

DOCTOR C996
There is but it's something I don't like to check because I'll tell you the reason because giving testosterone has it’s own risk, it hurts your liver you know.

PATIENT C996
Oh really.

DOCTOR C996
It can do a lot of different things.  It changes your sugar levels.

PATIENT C996
Oh.

DOCTOR C996
It'll do @@@muscle mass at the same time, so like the prostate.  So if you're older obviously there's an increased risk of prostate cancer.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
I think it's probably good that they advertise and we don't know who really has benefit.

PATIENT C996
Oh okay.

DOCTOR C996
So I don't recommend it unless like you're getting really fatigued, it's like maybe you know it's like you're getting more like your hair like on the arms falling out.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
You're developing breasts then I would think oh you don't have testosterone you know.

PATIENT C996
Oh okay.

DOCTOR C996
But like I think in general you know for low energy I wouldn't recommend it because of it’s more risks than benefits.

PATIENT C996
Cause that's just a bunch of hype.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah I mean we could check it but even if it was low and unless it was really low...

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
There’s no benefit.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
You know, it would have to be super low.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
I would be, I mean it's something we can look into.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
I mean as you get older, you lose a little bit of desire.  Do you have any trouble getting erections or anything?

PATIENT C996
Uh, kind of, sort of.

DOCTOR C996
Oh yeah, sometimes.

PATIENT C996
Sometimes it still works, sometime it don't.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.  Well then we'll do something.

PATIENT C996
Yeah I got a wife that's 10 years younger than me so she @@@.

DOCTOR C996
She wants you to do well.  Unterstandable.

PATIENT C996
That's alright.  I think it's um we'll have to get her a toy.  Hey whatever does it?  Right.

DOCTOR C996
But I guess the question is you know is there anything else that could be contributing and like how's your sleep been?

PATIENT C996
Uh that's kind of shitty at times.

DOCTOR C996
What happens? Do you wake up?  

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
Do you think you snore or you wake up short of breath or anything?

SECOND PERSON C996
No.

PATIENT C996
I goes to bed 9-9:30, go to sleep and I wake up.  If I don't take a Advil P.M. I wake up like 2 o'clock.

DOCTOR C996
Why are you waking up?  What's going on?

PATIENT C996
I don't know.  I just wake up.

DOCTOR C996
Are you tired @@@.

SECOND PERSON C996
No, uh uh.  I just wake up. I don’t know why.

PATIENT C996
What. 

DOCTOR C996
Huh.  Can you go back to sleep?

PATIENT C996
Yeah maybe after a while I go back to sleep.

DOCTOR C996
Are you tired during the day?

PATIENT C996
No I don't really do shit.  It's just that I wake up, I don't know why.

DOCTOR C996
I don't know why either yeah.

PATIENT C996
I wake up, I'm thinking on things that are important you know, crazy.

DOCTOR C996
Have been anxious?

PATIENT C996
What?

DOCTOR C996
Have you been anxious?

PATIENT C996
Sometimes I do get a little anxious.

DOCTOR C996
With worries about what?  Any in general?

PATIENT C996
No, just thinking about overall affairs.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah.

PATIENT C996
Just you know crazy shit.  How's the money going to last you know, I know, you know like and if I take an Advil P.M. I sleep good.

DOCTOR C996
I don't recommend probably continuing to do that.

PATIENT C996
Why?

DOCTOR C996
You know when you can.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
Now all we're going is @@@.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
If you feel like you're gonna wake up or you're having trouble, just take it before you go to bed.

PATIENT C996
It's like a half a pill you know.

DOCTOR C996
Good you know I mean I think it's real easy but I can give you a different medicine that might help with your erection problem.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
And if you feel maybe, you know another thing I think having a younger lady, do you feel pressure?

PATIENT C996
No.

DOCTOR C996
Any pressure to like perform?

PATIENT C996
No she's understanding.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.  

PATIENT C996
@@@.

DOCTOR C996
You know, sometimes that can play a part. You get worked up and you want to do it and when you want to do it so bad you can't.

PATIENT C996
I know sometimes when I see her cycle.

DOCTOR C996
Hmm.

PATIENT C996
She's going through menopause.

DOCTOR C996
Hmm.

PATIENT C996
Man she can get real crazy.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah.

PATIENT C996
The least little things, you know upset her, you know.  A guess women are like that @@@.

DOCTOR C996
I think around menopause is probably the worst.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
Cause the woman knows what's happening. Those hormones.

PATIENT C996
Do men go through menopause?

SECOND PERSON C996
Not really um.

DOCTOR C996
Your testosterone goes kind of go slowly.  It's not like how you where you just shut off.

SECOND PERSON C996
Right, right.

DOCTOR C996
Like a slow drop so over time you know notice obviously testosterone is @@@ talking about.

SECOND PERSON C996
Right, right.

DOCTOR C996
Not really, unless you're, testicles totally fails and generally when it fails you gotta go to @@@.

PATIENT C996
Right okay.  Yeah I guess I just have to, @@@, live off the memories.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah.  Well you know it's something I would think about checking from.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
If you really want, if you're really concerned about, how often can you get an erection?  Do you wake up with erections?

PATIENT C996
No not really.

DOCTOR C996
No.

PATIENT C996
I don't know even @@@.

DOCTOR C996
No, not anymore.

PATIENT C996
That's what I say is it supposed to drop like that?

DOCTOR C996
How quickly did it fall off, I mean fall away?

PATIENT C996
Um gradually.

DOCTOR C996
Like all the time?

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
Well I think you know, part of that is getting the diabetes under control.

PATIENT C996
Right.

SECOND PERSON C996
Yeah.

PATIENT C996
The medicines.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah.  Now that your sugars are getting pretty good.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
I think that's gonna help.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
And now the blood pressures even looks a little better. So that’s going to help.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
So the only thing that I would say that I think will help rather than the testosterone is you know getting around and like walking.

PATIENT C996
Exercising.

DOCTOR C996
Get the blood flowing.  The biggest problem is the blood flow.

PATIENT C996
Right, right.

DOCTOR C996
I doubt if its testosterone but you don’t look like a guy who is short on testosterone.

PATIENT C996
Yeah okay doc.

DOCTOR C996
I knew you did.  So I wouldn't worry about it.

PATIENT C996
Right okay.

DOCTOR C996
So I think you'll be okay.

PATIENT C996
Alright.

DOCTOR C996
Get moving.  Anything that cleans out the blood vessels is good.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
And get the blood flowing.

PATIENT C996
Okay.  I know I went out of town and I work, you know, I was enclosing my back porch and  @@@.

DOCTOR C996
Oh.

PATIENT C996
I worked every day. And I felt better. I got sore afterwards. After working you know so heart rate and all of that, I started feeling better though.  So I got to start exercising.

DOCTOR C996
You need to do that.

PATIENT C996
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR C996
It’s all you got to do it then.

PATIENT C996
Right, okay.

DOCTOR C996
So maybe that's the main thing.  I don't think you have any medications that are causing a problem and I'm just looking here.  Yeah you don't have any medications that should interfere.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
That would be another thing I'd check.

PATIENT C996
Don't the water pills do that?  The water pill?

DOCTOR C996
Not really. They shouldn't.  Everything else looks good.  

SECOND PERSON C996
@@@.

DOCTOR C996
I need to do a quick exam on you and you already got all your labs done.  They look obviously the cholesterol is still a little high.  Not where I want to see the bad cholesterol, the 128.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
I want that under 100 but if you take the niacin.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
That might help.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
Just take the aspirin before.  Cholesterol's okay.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
Not where we want it to be, it's just a little high triglycerides but that will go down when the diabetes is under better and better control, these are going to get better so.  @@@ before and your blood looks fine, nothing here that’s worrisome.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
So that's about it.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
Let me do a quick exam on you.  I'll go talk with the other doc and we'll get you out of here.  Do you need anything else?

PATIENT C996
Uh no I'm good.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.

PATIENT C996
It's all good.

DOCTOR C996
When did you take your inhaler last?

PATIENT C996
Uh this morning, about 8:00.

DOCTOR C996
Okay I think it's been fast but nothing.  Did you walk around a lot before you got here?

PATIENT C996
No.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.  You don't feel short or breath, chest pain?

PATIENT C996
No.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.  Nausea, vomiting?

PATIENT C996
No.

DOCTOR C996
You've been taking them with liquid?

PATIENT C996
Yeah, yeah.

DOCTOR C996
No fevers, chills?

PATIENT C996

DOCTOR C996
Coughing up anything?

PATIENT C996
No.

DOCTOR C996
Pain when you urinate?

PATIENT C996
Uh what?

DOCTOR C996
Any pain when you urinate?

PATIENT C996
No.

DOCTOR C996
Okay.  You are actually just a little bit fast.  I'm making you nervous.

PATIENT C996
You put me on the spot doc.

DOCTOR C996
Take a deep breath.  Again.  Any pain here?

PATIENT C996
No.

DOCTOR C996
Can I take a look at your feet?

PATIENT C996
Yeah sure.

DOCTOR C996
I want these reminders to quit.  Alright.

PATIENT C996
@@@.

DOCTOR C996
Is that right.  You don't want them too moist anyway.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
With diabetes.  So you got good feeling along through here?

PATIENT C996
Yes.  I had um surgery on that @@@.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah what'd you have done there?

PATIENT C996
I had like a hammertoe and.

DOCTOR C996
Is this recently.

SECOND PERSON C996
About a year.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.  It was painful as hell in that joint @@@.

DOCTOR C996
Better now?

PATIENT C996
Yeah it got kind of dark you know and they cut that joint up.  They broke that bone, put a pin in it and straightened it out.

DOCTOR C996
That helped out a lot?

PATIENT C996
What?

DOCTOR C996
That helped out a lot?

PATIENT C996
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR C996
Do you have feeling here?

PATIENT C996
Yes.

DOCTOR C996
@@@, working.

PATIENT C996

DOCTOR C996
@@@.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
Oh they want me to screen everyone for HIV.  I mean you already had labs drawn today.  I'll just say we'll do it next time.

PATIENT C996
Okay.  Yeah I think I'm safe.

DOCTOR C996
I’m sure you are, but they tell me to do it for everyone.

PATIENT C996
Yeah okay, okay.

DOCTOR C996
So but we can skip it today.  @@@.

PATIENT C996
Alright.

DOCTOR C996
And you had your c-scope four to five years ago.

PATIENT C996
Right.  

DOCTOR C996
I got it all set up.

PATIENT C996
What the?

DOCTOR C996
Oh the colonoscopy.

PATIENT C996
Oh.

DOCTOR C996
Everything else looks okay.  You said the @@@ is better.  Normal.  Everything else is normal.  Alright let me talk with the other doc.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
And I think, yeah no big changes.  Just we'll try that niacin okay.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
I'll be back in a moment.

PATIENT C996
And that aspirin won't let me get the burns huh?

DOCTOR C996
It'll help.  If it doesn't work we can try a full dose aspirin.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
The 325 and you can try that and that should help prevent it at least.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
Either that and if that doesn't work Benadryl.

PATIENT C996
Oh Benadryl.

DOCTOR C996
Yeah sometimes that works.  That's what's in the Tylenol P.M. anyway.

PATIENT C996
Right.

DOCTOR C996
So take it before bed.

PATIENT C996
Yeah.

DOCTOR C996
And it works like Tylenol P.M., it'll work.

PATIENT C996
Okay.

DOCTOR C996
Try it with the aspirin first.
