So I'll call you DOCTOR.

DOCTOR T382
Alright.  Okay um so.  @@@ So last time you came to see us in December @@@@, so it's been almost more than a year.

PATIENT T382
Right yeah.  So, cause I was doing so well they kicked me around.

DOCTOR T382
Oh okay, okay.  So you were doing great.

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
And in the meantime, so the only thing I see here is hypertension for you?

PATIENT T382
Right but I've had it all my life.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
I've had it basically all my life.  I've had hypertension.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
Um, my parents have had hypertension.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
So pretty most of my family have hypertension.

DOCTOR T382
Okay how medications do you take for that?

PATIENT T382
Uh I take two, I take uh, I take the hydrochlorothiazide two a day.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
And then I take a cholesterol pill at night.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  So here's the hydrochlorothiazide.  I don't see any cholesterol pills here.  @@@.  So it looks like the last time @@@.

PATIENT T382
Oh okay.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  So you take how many blood pressure medications do you take?

PATIENT T382
Two, I think I take two.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
Two.

DOCTOR T382
What's that with?

PATIENT T382
Uh the lipids, this one here.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  Lisinopril.

PATIENT T382
And then I get hydrochlorothiazide.

DOCTOR T382
Right.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
Okay, okay.  And it seemed like at one time that you were taking uh three medications.

PATIENT T382
Right, it was stopped right.

DOCTOR T382
@@@.

PATIENT T382
It was getting better, it was a lot better.

DOCTOR T382
Okay, okay, okay.  And for your cholesterol, I'll try to get the computer to get back here.

PATIENT T382
@@@ about that.

DOCTOR T382
Yeah.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
And uh so I'll just go with the other things.  So did you get a flu shot this year?

PATIENT T382
I don't do flu shots.

DOCTOR T382
You don't do flu shots okay.

PATIENT T382
I don't believe in them.

DOCTOR T382
It shows you got one in 2007 though.

PATIENT T382
No, if it says that, it's not telling the truth.  I haven't had it before.

DOCTOR T382
Oh okay.

PATIENT T382
And I've never ever gonna take a flu shot.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  

PATIENT T382
If I did it was only because the doctor I had, he was so emphatic.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
And I liked him so much that I did it that one time.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
With some series I took when I took them, but normally I never, ever, never get the flu shot.

DOCTOR T382
Oh okay, okay.

PATIENT T382
I don't believe in the theory because I was born in the generation that we've been inoculated, vaccines, this and that.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
So one more thing that my body has to fight and it might just put me in a place that I don't want to be.

DOCTOR T382
Okay, okay.

PATIENT T382
But that's why I don't.  There's enough germs floating around and I already have enough antibodies I believe that.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
I don't need anymore.

DOCTOR T382
Well that's good that you think that.  I don't see any cholesterol @@@.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
So that's a good thing.  

SECOND PERSON T382
@@@ cholesterol is a good thing?

PATIENT T382
Actually, I still have some left.

DOCTOR T382
Do you know which one?

SECOND PERSON T382
Not off the top of my head I don't.

PATIENT T382
Well it should be on there from prior.

DOCTOR T382
Prior notes?

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  Okay so you're taking simvastatin 80 mg.  Are you still taking this @@@?

PATIENT T382
Yes.

DOCTOR T382
You sure?

PATIENT T382
Yes.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  So your blood tested fine.  Uh so you're taking simvastatin.  It seems that you were taking 80 mg.

PATIENT T382
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T382
Do you think that’s still true?

PATIENT T382
Well you know how I was taking 80 and you told me to break it in half and take 40, that's probably why I still have all that.

DOCTOR T382
Oh you take 40 okay.  Let me correct this, so you were taking 40.  And your kidney function is a little bit lower than the usual person.  I think you've heard that before.

PATIENT T382
Right I've heard that before.

DOCTOR T382
Yeah but it's been stable.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
So that's good.

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
So basically your blood tests look good.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
And cholesterol looks good too.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
So you can continue to take your statin.  I'll order that today so that if you run out.  Do you want them to send it to your home?

PATIENT T382
Yes.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
I have one other problem.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
I have a hernia, oh well I had a hernia.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
But I don't know if it has, because I didn't have no surgery or if just kind of healed on its own.

DOCTOR T382
Okay uh so let me examine you and then I can see.

PATIENT T382
Yeah.

DOCTOR T382
Uh so you had this for a long time?

PATIENT T382
No.

DOCTOR T382
Just started?

PATIENT T382
No um it was I did some heavy lifting at a job.

DOCTOR T382
Oh.

PATIENT T382
Over the Christmas holidays.

DOCTOR T382
Over the Christmas holidays was that it?

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
So that job ended in probably first or second week of January, so eventually it went down.  @@@ research.  So I knew what the surgery looks like, but but I never knew what a hernia was cause I'd never had one so I looked it up.

DOCTOR T382
Yeah so those things, you know, you don't have it done when @@@.  Well did say you developed it?

PATIENT T382
You know um @@@.

DOCTOR T382
You know um @@@ can affect that.  So it's not something really but I can assess that.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
Yeah.  But it's nothing urgent.  Do you have any severe belly pain or difficulty sleeping?

PATIENT T382
No.

DOCTOR T382
Nausea?

PATIENT T382
No.

DOCTOR T382
Vomiting?

PATIENT T382
No.  I would a came in.

DOCTOR T382
Because you don’t have those symptoms, it means it’s not urgent.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
And is it bothering you a lot?

PATIENT T382
No.

DOCTOR T382
Not bothering at all?

PATIENT T382
No it's not bothering me at all.

DOCTOR T382
So that's going to be basically an elective surgery.

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
So if you want to do it, if you want to fix it, I just refer you to the Surgery surgeon.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
Because if it's not bothering you at all right now.

PATIENT T382
Just leave it alone.

DOCTOR T382
And if you want to wait, you could just leave it alone.

PATIENT T382
No there's no pain or anything, no discomfort.

DOCTOR T382
Yeah.  Um if you have a pain in a hernia, that's kind of an emergency so you have to come.

PATIENT T382
Right okay.

DOCTOR T382
But you don't have any pain right now.

PATIENT T382
No.

DOCTOR T382
Then uh you can wait, it's up to you.

PATIENT T382
No it wasn't, well actually the only thing there was a little bit of swelling.  There wasn't no active pain that even occurred.

DOCTOR T382
Okay let me take a look okay.  Alright so your blood pressure medicines and you still have the blood pressure medicines or do you need refills?

PATIENT T382
No I think I'm okay @@@ today.  I think a couple of these.  Look at the, I mean I have that and basically I think it's good till March or April of 2007, @@@ I don't know what the number is.

DOCTOR T382
So, it's only April @@@@ so I'll refill this one.

PATIENT T382
Right you have to refill that one.

DOCTOR T382
And this one's going to be on May.  I'll have to go refill both of them.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
And you have some drops for the eyes.

PATIENT T382
Right but I'm in the Eye Clinic.

DOCTOR T382
Oh okay so they can refill that.

PATIENT T382
Right, right.

DOCTOR T382
On your eyes.  Have you had an ultrasound of your kidneys before?  Do you remember?

PATIENT T382
Uh I don't remember.  More than likely yes but that's why I think they said it was just something we have to watch.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
I think I have.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
Because I've been on hydrochlorothiazide for so many years.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
Uh, I don't know, how many years.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
So.

DOCTOR T382
So hydrochlorothiazide you get 60 pills at a time, I'll change it so you can get 90 pills at a time and then three refills that'll last you for one year.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
I'll send you this.  And what time do you take the blood pressure pills?

PATIENT T382
In the morning.

DOCTOR T382
In the morning.  Morning is fine but I actually.  Do you check your blood pressure at home?

PATIENT T382
I can.

DOCTOR T382
You can, you have a machine there?

PATIENT T382
Yes.

DOCTOR T382
Okay so I actually recommend um taking it at night.  The reason is because when you take it in the morning.

PATIENT T382
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T382
It seems in the daytime you have good blood pressure, so when you take it you have a good blood pressure.

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
Uh but some people have higher blood pressure when they're sleeping.

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
And then those are the times that we have more risks of having some kind of event like you know.

PATIENT T382
Yeah but if you take it at night you're going to have to get up in the night and go to the bathroom right?

DOCTOR T382
With @@@?  To you pee more with the @@@?

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
Okay then we can do this.

PATIENT T382
Right so if I know exactly what you're saying but if you take it at night then you take it, you know you'll have to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning to go to the bathroom.

DOCTOR T382
Okay so @@@ there is more peeing?

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
So we can keep that in the morning and how about taking the other one, lisinopril at night?

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
Does that make sense?

PATIENT T382
Yeah.

DOCTOR T382
But you know, if you take both in the morning, in the daytime you have a good blood pressure and you say okay I'm fine.

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
But at night time you may have a high blood pressure and we don't know.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
So if you sleep at night then in the daytime you'll see you know your higher blood pressures.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
And if that's controlled I would say don't lower it.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
Do you see what I am saying?

PATIENT T382
I know exactly what you're saying.  No I understand completely.  I've been coming here to the doctors for, no, no I understand.

DOCTOR T382
Yeah.

PATIENT T382
Exactly what you're saying.

DOCTOR T382
Yeah.

PATIENT T382
That makes all the sense in the world.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  So let's do that.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
And then there's one shot called Dtap.  I don't know if you've had that before um tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis.  I don't think you had that before.  It prevents from three diseases, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis.

PATIENT T382
Have I ever had it before?

DOCTOR T382
You had one called tetanus D.

PATIENT T382
Yes, yes.

DOCTOR T382
To prevent tetanus and diphtheria.

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
That didn't cover pertussis.

PATIENT T382
What is pertussis?

DOCTOR T382
That's what's called uh.

PATIENT T382
Whooping cough?

DOCTOR T382
Whooping cough yes and so right now we have this new vaccine so the recommendation from the top is that.

PATIENT T382
You ask the patient do they want it?

DOCTOR T382
Yeah we have to ask.

PATIENT T382
@@@.

DOCTOR T382
And if the patient is younger than 65.

PATIENT T382
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR T382
We recommended everybody to get those um vaccines.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
So if you don't mind we can do that today.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
Okay let's do that.

PATIENT T382
I'm doing it because you're new and I like you.

DOCTOR T382
Then you had a polyp when they did the colonoscopy in 2007.

PATIENT T382
Right I had a polyp right.

DOCTOR T382
So the recommendation for you is to repeat the colonoscopy in five to seven years.

PATIENT T382
That's right.

DOCTOR T382
So five years is going to be 2012.

PATIENT T382
That's this year?

DOCTOR T382
It's this year.

PATIENT T382
Has it been that long?

DOCTOR T382
And seven years is going to be uh 2014.

PATIENT T382
Right.  So I need to be scheduled for a colonoscopy this year.

DOCTOR T382
Yeah I think if you want to schedule, we can schedule this year.

PATIENT T382
Yep.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  

PATIENT T382
No problem.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
Sounds good.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  And uh labs, we'll get all the labs we need.  So I was thinking that you might do that so I ordered the lab tests that we need, yeah @@@ great.  So I'll just schedule it.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
I'll just schedule it and you get the colonoscopy.

PATIENT T382
Okay.  Yeah they'll call me and say @@@ they don't tell you the reserve day.  @@@.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  You had the ultrasound I can't see it here.

PATIENT T382
And that had to be quite a while ago um when I was in Arizona and it might have been oh six or seven years ago now.  It might need to be repeated if you want another one.

DOCTOR T382
Oh okay.  Do you remember having one?

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
A renal ultrasound and they said it was normal?

PATIENT T382
Right.  Okay now it had to be during the summer in maybe 2000.

DOCTOR T382
Okay, okay.  So let's see what you got on your hermia, okay.  Do you smoke sir?

PATIENT T382
No never have.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
Not one cigarette in my whole life.

DOCTOR T382
Do you drink?

PATIENT T382
No.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  Um how's your weight doing?

PATIENT T382
Uh I might have gained about 10-15 pounds.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
In the last year.

DOCTOR T382
Okay are you watching your diet?

PATIENT T382
No.

DOCTOR T382
Okay, take a deep breath.

PATIENT T382
Uh no, am I watching my diet, uh try to eat normal.  I don't eat, I don't eat, real good food and vegetables and stuff like that but.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
Yeah so this is a, yeah you're right, this is a hernia.

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
Um, @@@.  So it's up to you.  If it's bothering you and you think you want a surgery, you can be referred to Surgery.  I can refer you to Surgery if you want to talk to them um but if you think it's not bothering you right now, unless.

PATIENT T382
It's bothering me in pain right.

DOCTOR T382
Right, right, right.

PATIENT T382
No there's no pain.

DOCTOR T382
Or does it feel like something's hanging and it's feeling ordinary or no?

PATIENT T382
I just know it's a true @@@.  But see the thing is, sometimes when I urinate it makes a sound.

DOCTOR T382
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T382
Cause you know the opening there so it makes a sound.

DOCTOR T382
Uh-huh.

PATIENT T382
That's the only thing that I've noticed.  Other than that there's really no pain or anything.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
So is the surgery outpatient?  @@@.

DOCTOR T382
Um I'm not sure.  I come from other countries.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
So where I did my training we used to um have people stay for three or four days um but I don't know how they do, I can ask.

PATIENT T382
Yeah right, ask them, ask somebody.  Do they do it.

DOCTOR T382
If it is an outpatient do you want to do it?

PATIENT T382
Yeah.

DOCTOR T382
If it's an outpatient.  

PATIENT T382
And so mostly what I would do is go on the internet and they will show the surgery because they actually show the whole physical surgery on the internet and this was back in 2000 and they were saying it wasn't outpatient then so I was thinking this is 2012, it ought to be outpatient now.
 
DOCTOR T382
After all this time, with shorter stays in the hospital.

PATIENT T382
Yeah right, right, so you can ask yeah.

DOCTOR T382
If it's an outpatient you want the surgery.

PATIENT T382
The surgery right.

DOCTOR T382
Alright.  Do you ming getting up?

PATIENT T382

DOCTOR T382
That's just a procedure.

PATIENT T382
No, uh uh.  No no major surgery or anything like that.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.  And then um okay.  You don't want to do the flu shot.

PATIENT T382
Yeah I refuse the flu shot but I'll take the other shot because you're the new guy in the neighborhood.

DOCTOR T382

DOCTOR T382
Alright and have you ever talked about an Advanced Directive and stuff?

PATIENT T382

PATIENT T382
Yeah I think I have that all in place.

DOCTOR T382
And they have it here?

PATIENT T382
Yes.

DOCTOR T382
So you have a Power of Attorney right?

PATIENT T382
Yes.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
Oh okay.

PATIENT T382
But it's in place.  I think it was my sister because I haven't been married that long.

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
A little over a year.

DOCTOR T382
Well that's it, so the only thing I have to ask is if the hernia repair is an outpatient @@@.

(DOCTOR OUT:  49:31  DOCTOR IN:  53:29)

DOCTOR T382
Okay sir.  So I asked about the hernia and you see like in the private sector they do it as a one day outpatient procedure, but here at the VA we usually keep you overnight.

PATIENT T382
Okay.

DOCTOR T382
So it's going to be @@@ procedure but if you want to do that I can refer you to Surgery.

PATIENT T382
No overnight is one day.  

DOCTOR T382
So I'll just refer you to the Surgery.

PATIENT T382
Right.

DOCTOR T382
And uh.

PATIENT T382
They're gonna call me.

DOCTOR T382
Yeah they're gonna call you.  Okay.

PATIENT T382
Okay, alright.

DOCTOR T382

PATIENT T382
No.

DOCTOR T382
Fine.

PATIENT T382

DOCTOR T382
Okay.

PATIENT T382
Alright.

DOCTOR T382
