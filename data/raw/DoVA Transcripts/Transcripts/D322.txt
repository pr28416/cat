DOCTOR D322
And in general how's your exercise tolerance, can you walk without getting short of breath?

DOCTOR D322
Pretty good.

PATIENT D322
Yes.

DOCTOR D322

DOCTOR D322
Okay and you're taking the Combivent?

PATIENT D322
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D322
Anything else going on? any chest pains, fevers or chills?

PATIENT D322
No you know just the heat.  Break out in a cold sweat you now and hopefully by the time I get to work tomorrow @@@.

PATIENT D322

DOCTOR D322

DOCTOR D322
Not since this morning.

PATIENT D322
My @@@ was 95.  @@@.

PATIENT D322
Uh you know I think I still stayed the same.

DOCTOR D322

PATIENT D322
Uh you know the other day I don’t eat a lot @@@.

DOCTOR D322
But at night you eat a real meal?

PATIENT D322
Yeah late night @@@.

DOCTOR D322
Still smoking?

PATIENT D322
Yeah still working on it.

DOCTOR D322
Um.

PATIENT D322
@@@.

DOCTOR D322
What do you want to do to quit?  How else can I help you?

PATIENT D322
Well I had the patches, but I still got some of those.  I use @@@.  I put one on @@@ I change it and tried it when I go to work @@@.  Mooching off me and @@@.

DOCTOR D322
Would you want to see the Smoking Cessation Clinic here?  Maybe they have.  I mean I can offer you patches and @@@ drugs but they may have some different method of um smoking cessation like using behavioral modification or.

PATIENT D322
No, I’m gonna try it on my own.

DOCTOR D322
Okay.

PATIENT D322
I'm not sure @@@.

DOCTOR D322
How much are you smoking?

PATIENT D322
Uh about maybe a half a pack a day now.  I've cut down.

DOCTOR D322
Okay.

PATIENT D322
One week, I had it down to like three cigarettes but then @@@.

DOCTOR D322
It's hard, I mean I've never smoked so I don't really know a lot about it but, from what I hear it's hard to @@@.

PATIENT D322
Since I was 13.

DOCTOR D322
Yeah but it would improve your lung function.

PATIENT D322
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D322
You know your lung function will continue to deteriorate at a rapid rate if you keep smoking.  If you stop smoking it kind of goes back to the normal deteriorating rate, you know if you hadn't smoked so.

PATIENT D322
Now did you get my medical forms?  I brought in my uh medical stuff from my other doctor and she said she was going to give it to you.

DOCTOR D322
Let me look.  Nothing is in my mailbox right now, when did you bring it in?

PATIENT D322
Well last.

DOCTOR D322
Long time ago?

PATIENT D322
Yes.

DOCTOR D322
Okay.

PATIENT D322
The first time I went to the Emergency Room @@@ follow-up.

DOCTOR D322
And then you saw me.

PATIENT D322
No I saw somebody else, DOCTOR.

DOCTOR D322
Oh, between me and the.

PATIENT D322
Yeah.

DOCTOR D322
Oh you saw DOCTOR.

PATIENT D322
No I didn't see a doctor, another girl but.

DOCTOR D322
Yeah the resident.

PATIENT D322
Then I came back one day I had an appointment with you but then it was cancelled so then I got in to see the nurse and I gave the nurse the forms @@@.

DOCTOR D322
Let me look for that.

PATIENT D322
Yeah if you could.  My doctor @@@ 50% @@@.

DOCTOR D322
Well we were going to repeat the PFTs but I don't think that's been done yet.  The order is in.  Oh, it’s active.  Let me see if I can find it.  Oh you didn't show up, maybe you didn't know.  When they set you up for an appointment on 03/11 at 2 o'clock but it says you didn't show up.

PATIENT D322
I didn't get anything.

DOCTOR D322
Here why don’t we redo the order.  We need to check your lung function.

PATIENT D322
This time I got one, I was going to be on vacation then and now I have to take off and I'm losing money @@@.

DOCTOR D322
Well, it doesn't take very long.  @@@ 15 minutes.  

PATIENT D322
@@@ day off @@@.

DOCTOR D322
Yeah.  Want to hold off for now?

PATIENT D322
Let's hold off for now and uh.

DOCTOR D322
If your symptoms start to change then we'll make more of an effort to.

PATIENT D322
Yeah, @@@.  I'd like to hang on until January when I have vacation time.

DOCTOR D322
Let me check your vitals.  Blood pressure is a little high; I just want to recheck it.  Looks like we checked some labs back in February. Blood work.It looks like your blood counts look good.  Your kidney function is good.  Your cholesterol looks good.  We want this number under 200 and @@@ under 160 and its 100 and this is your good cholesterol the HDL and yours is great.  That's like the best good cholesterol I've ever seen.  Well that's another thing we probably need to talk about um.  How much are you drinking?

PATIENT D322
Uh maybe four drinks a week.

DOCTOR D322
So last time you told me eight so that must be getting better.

PATIENT D322
@@@.

DOCTOR D322
Okay.  Well maybe chest x-ray @@@.

PATIENT D322
@@@.

DOCTOR D322
@@@.  Why did we do the CAT scan again?

PATIENT D322
Uh.

DOCTOR D322
Oh the weight loss.

PATIENT D322
Yeah.

DOCTOR D322
Huh, right.  But they didn't see anything.  

PATIENT D322
@@@.

DOCTOR D322
Well they saw like some degenerative joint disease in the spine which happens as people get older.  You get a little bit of arthritis, just like you would get in you know your knees and spine.  So if that becomes a problem you have to let me know.

PATIENT D322
I get it once in a while, right in my lower back.

DOCTOR D322
Okay.  I think it was about here where they saw it.

PATIENT D322
I just get it once in a while.

DOCTOR D322
@@@ and the treatment for that would be taking something like Tylenol or ibuprofen.

PATIENT D322
Oh.

DOCTOR D322
Or Naproxen or something like that.  Uh, okay.  I'd forgotten about that.  So it looked okay.  Good.  The PFTs we'll need to do it later okay.  Okay, what else were we going to do?  Oh did you see Mental Health?

PATIENT D322
No I didn't.

DOCTOR D322
Do you feel depressed at all?

PATIENT D322
Just @@@.

DOCTOR D322
Okay so normal.

PATIENT D322
Yeah, just the normal feelings.

DOCTOR D322
No feelings of hurting yourself.

PATIENT D322
No.

DOCTOR D322
@@@.  

PATIENT D322
@@@.  

DOCTOR D322
I'm going to check a couple other things here while you're here.  They checked your prostate gland it looks fine.  They checked your thyroid and it looks good.  The cholesterol we talked about.  They checked your vitamin levels, sometimes when you drink beer you don't get the right vitamins.

PATIENT D322
Yeah.

DOCTOR D322
That all looked good.  So far so good.

PATIENT D322
I’m going to live.

DOCTOR D322
Yeah, you just quit smoking though really, we talked about that so.

PATIENT D322
Yeah I know.

DOCTOR D322
Uh now a colonoscopy, what do you think about that?

PATIENT D322
No.

DOCTOR D322
So you're still thinking about it.

PATIENT D322
I'm still thinking about it.

DOCTOR D322
Okay.  Um everything else looks good.  Well, let me take a listen to you.  You don't drive after you drink or anything like that?

PATIENT D322
No I don't believe in that.  @@@.

DOCTOR D322
No.  You don't need it and neither does anyone else on the street.

PATIENT D322
Yeah I know, my twin brother got a warrant out for his arrest so he used my name and put @@@ under that and now, since he was here, he died here and he got the warrant out it's on me now too.

DOCTOR D322
Oh my goodness.

PATIENT D322
So whenever they look for my license plate, his name comes up and my name comes up and I get pulled over and I end up going back to the station and everything so.

DOCTOR D322
Oh my God.  Is this recent?

PATIENT D322
Uh nine years ago is when he died up here.

DOCTOR D322
Oh man.

PATIENT D322
And uh, he was a bad boy.

DOCTOR D322
Well he's your brother.

PATIENT D322
Yeah, messing around.  Ever since he got his Drivers License when he was 1.

DOCTOR D322
He was trouble.

PATIENT D322
@@@.  But every time he got, every time he got arrested.

DOCTOR D322
@@@.

PATIENT D322
Yeah.

DOCTOR D322
@@@.

PATIENT D322
No.  I think he had a @@@ Vietnam. @@@  

DOCTOR D322
When people @@@ react @@@.  Can you see @@@

PATIENT D322
Yeah I can see something bright, like on a bright day, I @@@.

DOCTOR D322
Okay.

PATIENT D322
@@@.

DOCTOR D322
That's really weird, I didn't notice that last time.  We always worry about people if they aren’t symmetrical @@@ their brain.

PATIENT D322
Right.

DOCTOR D322
It's a big problem, but if you've had it for a long time so.  You know.  Not to scare you, I am sure it is fine.

PATIENT D322
No it never bothered me.

DOCTOR D322
Take a deep breath, again.  Breathe normally.  Let's repeat your blood pressure.  All my patients in the hospital right have to have blood pressures.  I've been repeating them all day.

PATIENT D322
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D322
Getting really good at it.

PATIENT D322
@@@.

DOCTOR D322
Huh?

PATIENT D322
Wife's was 247/197.

DOCTOR D322
Oh my God at home?

PATIENT D322
No she's in the hospital.  She had an infection on her leg @@@.

DOCTOR D322
I had someone come into the clinic with a blood pressure like that.  @@@.  It's 120/90.

PATIENT D322
@@@.

DOCTOR D322
Yeah it could be the stress of parking and getting in here.  Okay.  I got to make sure we don’t need to treat you.  Otherwise you feel pretty good?  Your lungs sound good.

PATIENT D322
Yeah.  Doing good.

DOCTOR D322
Okay and no blood in the stool or anything?

PATIENT D322
No.

DOCTOR D322
So think about the colonoscopy.  I mean I can't force you but it's always a good idea to look.

PATIENT D322
Yeah I know, my boss was telling me that.

DOCTOR D322
Yeah, well early detection is nice because they pull the polyp out and it's gone so.

PATIENT D322
Yeah.

DOCTOR D322
So yeah.

PATIENT D322
But um.  I was going to ask you, how bad, I mean the lowest blood pressure how low can it go?

DOCTOR D322
Well.

PATIENT D322
To where it's bad.

DOCTOR D322
For you you mean?

PATIENT D322
No my wife, she's been on medication.

DOCTOR D322
It's kind of dependent on symptoms uh for her, once you hit below like 90, the top number 90.

PATIENT D322
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D322
Then you kind of have to start to worry that maybe the blood pressure medicine is too much and especially if she feels lightheaded when she stands up.

PATIENT D322
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D322
Or feels like she's going to pass out, you know that kind of feeling then you have to worry if the blood pressure medicine is too much.

PATIENT D322
Okay.

DOCTOR D322
So.

PATIENT D322
I wish I could get her here @@@.

DOCTOR D322
And sometimes too if you, if you want, just kind of like that's what we do here in the hospital but if you take her blood pressure lying down.

PATIENT D322
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D322
And then have her stand up and stand for like two minutes and then take her blood pressure standing up, those numbers should be almost the same.  If the blood pressure standing up is a lot lower like 20 points lower then she's probably on too much medicine okay.

PATIENT D322
Okay.  Thanks.

DOCTOR D322
So you could try that and at least  you’ll know.  So I'll be right back okay.

PATIENT D322
Alright.

DOCTOR D322
Five minutes.

PATIENT D322
Okay.

DOCTOR D322
I'm the only one here so.  Real quick.

(DOCTOR OUT:  39:36  DOCTOR IN:  44:08)

DOCTOR D322
Okay, you're good, nothing new.

PATIENT D322
Alright.

DOCTOR D322
When do you think you should come back.  Do you want to try and do six months?

PATIENT D322
Yeah.

DOCTOR D322
Okay if something happens obviously.

PATIENT D322
Oh yeah.

DOCTOR D322
Come back sooner.

PATIENT D322
Yeah @@@.

DOCTOR D322
Or I mean, do you think you can handle waiting to see me or something just try and make an appointment sooner.  If you need to come to the ER, come to the ER.

PATIENT D322
Okay.  @@@.

DOCTOR D322
Okay.

PATIENT D322
The only time I do that is if I get really congested at night @@@ these things are working or the albuterol is running out.

DOCTOR D322
Yeah well if you run out call and I'll refill them.

PATIENT D322
Okay.

DOCTOR D322
Okay.

PATIENT D322
Alright.

DOCTOR D322
That's the easiest.

PATIENT D322
Alright I'll be doing it online.

DOCTOR D322
Okay, yeah do.  Renew but if they tell you you have no refills.

PATIENT D322
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR D322
Then you have to call and they will contact me to renew it.

PATIENT D322
Oh okay.

DOCTOR D322
So you should have enough for six months then.

PATIENT D322
Okay.

DOCTOR D322
Okay.

PATIENT D322
Alright great.

DOCTOR D322
Alright, there you go.  Nice job.

PATIENT D322
