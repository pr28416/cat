PATIENT Y471
And it's like as soon as I started some of these pills, I just ballooned.  I feel bloated and you know.

DOCTOR Y471
Well let me examine you.  If you mind taking off your shoes and socks and then taking a seat right here okay.

PATIENT Y471
You asked about diabetes.

DOCTOR Y471
Yes.

PATIENT Y471
Obviously a drop in sugar would be typical for diabetes right.

DOCTOR Y471
Um drop in sugar could, I mean you mean with dizziness?

PATIENT Y471
Once in a while, like just now before I was here, now my temperature’s up too I'm sweating here but um.  I have this thing where I feel sort of like I have pain in my stomach like a real hunger pain, hunger pain.

DOCTOR Y471
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y471
And I'll start sweating and I'll start feeling shaky.

DOCTOR Y471
Oh okay.

PATIENT Y471
Like I thought that might be due.

DOCTOR Y471
Yeah it could be if you don't have enough insulin.

PATIENT Y471
Right.

DOCTOR Y471
To settle the sugar into the cells then your cells think that there isn't any sugar around and it could have that type of affect on you and sometimes people who have.

PATIENT Y471
You want my socks off too?

DOCTOR Y471
Yes I do.

PATIENT Y471
Uh you might not.

DOCTOR Y471
Please, you can only imagine what I smell @@@.

PATIENT Y471
I can't stand the smell.

DOCTOR Y471
@@@ a problem.  So uh sometimes insulin insensitivity can manifest by skin tags on the neck.

PATIENT Y471
I have a lot of them.

DOCTOR Y471
Yeah they why I asked if they checked your sugars.

PATIENT Y471
@@@ good.  I mean I was fasting.

PATIENT Y471
@@@.  I actually went to a masseuse last week because of the pain.

DOCTOR Y471
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y471
And when she would push on my low back it really hurt.

DOCTOR Y471
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y471
But eventually it started feeling better.

DOCTOR Y471

PATIENT Y471
Right there.

DOCTOR Y471

PATIENT Y471

DOCTOR Y471
Yeah.

PATIENT Y471
Right about there, I do feel a bunch of pins going up my spine.

DOCTOR Y471
@@@.  Right here?

PATIENT Y471
Uh-huh and when I was little @@@.  I've had this one since I was born.

DOCTOR Y471
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y471
This one just showed up not like, maybe within a year and a half.

DOCTOR Y471
@@@.

PATIENT Y471
@@@.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay, have a seat.

PATIENT Y471
You said diabetes can cause that?

DOCTOR Y471
It could, not always.

PATIENT Y471
Can I put my socks back on again?

DOCTOR Y471
So, regarding your hip and your legs.  The reason why I say hip is because groin pain a lot of times is because of a hip problem um.  When people have pain in their hip it radiates to their groin.  Now the side pain I think.

PATIENT Y471
Sciatica?

DOCTOR Y471
No, it's not sciatica.  I don't think it's sciatica at least but um it could be that you have a little bit of a disk herniation.  Cause you're telling me you have burning in that area.  Does it sometimes feel like pins and needles at all?

PATIENT Y471
No, burning @@@.  It sometimes feels like its throbbing @@@.

DOCTOR Y471
Right.

PATIENT Y471
So.

DOCTOR Y471
And so that makes me think its neuropathic pain like sometimes when the disk bulges and hits @@@ spinal cord a little bit.  So and for that type of pain there's something called gabapentin which is for burning.

PATIENT Y471
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR Y471
Nerve pain.

PATIENT Y471
I’ll let you know that now that you’re saying nerves.  I've had tests on my hands.

DOCTOR Y471
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y471
They say the nerves in my thumb are shot.

DOCTOR Y471
Oh, where they put the needle in there and.

PATIENT Y471
They put an electric shock on my hand.

DOCTOR Y471
Right, right.

PATIENT Y471
And they said the results were - I had the carpal tunnel the VA took care of.

DOCTOR Y471
Right.

PATIENT Y471
But uh doctor out there tried to put me on uh Cymbalta.

DOCTOR Y471
Yeah.

PATIENT Y471
For nerve pain.

DOCTOR Y471
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y471
I never took it.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay.

PATIENT Y471
@@@ but.

DOCTOR Y471
So the gabapentin, I know you said you worked with machines.

PATIENT Y471
I work with machines.

DOCTOR Y471
Gabapentin can make you sleepy but that's if you start taking it the 300 mg three times a day.  What I would recommend is the following.  I want to get uh an x-ray of your hip.

PATIENT Y471
Okay.

DOCTOR Y471
And make sure there nothing wrong like a fracture and then you have those spine films which look fine but because you are getting this neuropathic pain.  I think an MRI would be a good idea.  Are you claustrophobic?

PATIENT Y471
No.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay.  So um, have you had an MRI before?

PATIENT Y471
Naw.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay so you’re in a tube.

PATIENT Y471
Yeah.

DOCTOR Y471
@@@.

PATIENT Y471
My wife has them because she had a brain tumor, 11 years ago, 12 years ago.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay, okay.

PATIENT Y471
She gets them all the time.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay, alright.  So we'll see if you have a hard time, if you get claustrophobic or not.

PATIENT Y471
(Laughter)

DOCTOR Y471
Um, just to see if the disk is kind of radiating coming out and um, @@@ test I want to do and in the meantime for this pain because of the discomfort that you're having I want to start the gabapentin and that is a dose that can be titrated up to 1000 mg three times a day.

PATIENT Y471
Okay.

DOCTOR Y471
I'm gonna start you on a lower dose though because it can really knock you out if you take it.

PATIENT Y471
Is this an anti-inflammatory or?

DOCTOR Y471
No it's not.  It is specifically for this burning, throbbing pain.

PATIENT Y471
Okay.

DOCTOR Y471
But I want you to start taking 300 mg at night.

PATIENT Y471
Okay.

DOCTOR Y471
And then.

PATIENT Y471
For the neuropathic pain.

DOCTOR Y471
@@@ at night and then you build tolerance to it and then you take it twice a day, once at night for a week then twice a day
for a week and then three times a day.

PATIENT Y471
Okay.

DOCTOR Y471
If you notice at any time that one of those doses makes you too sleepy then go back to the lower dose two times a day or one time a day.

PATIENT Y471
I can mix with the meds I do now?

DOCTOR Y471
Yeah, definitely yes.

PATIENT Y471
@@@ I mean like I said it got real bad.  Well I had two scopes.

DOCTOR Y471
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y471
And this Nexium, I first had uh what's that stuff called, @@@ no, no it's the other.

DOCTOR Y471
Prilosec.

PATIENT Y471
Nope, nope, it’s not a @@@ something else.

DOCTOR Y471
Lansoprazole.

PATIENT Y471
Yes.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay.

PATIENT Y471
I had that and I started getting, I had my statin at the time for my cholesterol.

DOCTOR Y471
Oh no.

PATIENT Y471
Oh yeah I took it and oh God.

DOCTOR Y471
Oh no.

PATIENT Y471
And so I started and then I lost some weight then I was looking at doing herbal stuff and it was working for a while and I DOCTOR approved that fish oil.

DOCTOR Y471
I'm glad you brought that up so the weight issue.

PATIENT Y471
Yeah.

DOCTOR Y471
And with any time of uh like muscular pain.  Especially if you have some disk herniation, the weight loss.

PATIENT Y471
Weight loss right.

DOCTOR Y471
The @@@.

PATIENT Y471
Oh how do you, deal with anestrozole makes you gain weight.

DOCTOR Y471
Right.

PATIENT Y471
I know doctors say some of that is not true.

DOCTOR Y471
Right.

PATIENT Y471
But everybody that I've talked to says it’s true.

DOCTOR Y471
@@@.

PATIENT Y471
30 or 40 pounds of weight gain within a short time.

DOCTOR Y471
Yeah.  Um, that's why @@@.  Well in terms of specifics, especially because you have @@@ ulcers, @@@ is important.

PATIENT Y471
Yes.

DOCTOR Y471
Um and so I know you say you've been trying to eat healthy and you move a lot at work.

PATIENT Y471
Definitely right.

DOCTOR Y471
And you have consistent activity.

PATIENT Y471
Right.

DOCTOR Y471
You know instead of short bursts.

PATIENT Y471
Right short bursts and whatever right.

DOCTOR Y471
What we usually look for is consistent activity to keep your heart rate elevated for a half an hour and so you probably work long hours as well but if there's any way that you can fit in some type of physical activity.

PATIENT Y471
@@@.

DOCTOR Y471
At least three times a week and then really cut out having the Raisinettes when you come.

PATIENT Y471
It wasn’t Raisinettes, it was like a trail mix.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay, okay.

PATIENT Y471
The raisins, bananas, peanuts @@@.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay, okay, that's not too bad.

PATIENT Y471
Sunflowers and.

DOCTOR Y471
@@@  But you know eating healthy so um and I'm not saying completely take you out @@@ diet because then people won't do it but if you know fried foods, if you have that multiple times a day or multiple times a week just limit it to once a week.  If you have fast food every day, @@@.  You know @@@.

PATIENT Y471
I'm trying to lose some weight though.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay, just start and then cut out @@@.

PATIENT Y471
@@@.

DOCTOR Y471
So stuff like that will help and then hopefully with the losing weight and then the last thing I can give @@@ offer you physical therapy.

PATIENT Y471
Okay.

DOCTOR Y471
And so they can you know show you strengthening exercises specifically you know after you get the MRI done uh, what we can do is wait to see what the MRI results are and if there are some abnormalities then Physical Therapy can work with you.

PATIENT Y471
Okay.

DOCTOR Y471
Okay.

PATIENT Y471
Can the MRI be on a Saturday?

DOCTOR Y471
I don't know.

PATIENT Y471
Okay.

DOCTOR Y471
@@@ okay.

PATIENT Y471
Alright.  Also I have these fatty tumors down my back.

DOCTOR Y471
Yeah.

PATIENT Y471

DOCTOR Y471
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y471
I've been finding more, quite a few more.

DOCTOR Y471
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y471
There were only certain ones that hurt.

DOCTOR Y471
Yeah.

PATIENT Y471

DOCTOR Y471
Hmm.

PATIENT Y471
But they will cause some pain.

DOCTOR Y471
Uh-huh.

PATIENT Y471
But they’re uh.

DOCTOR Y471
Well if it's more we can refer you to the dermatologist and you can talk to them also about that.

PATIENT Y471

So, I'm gonna order that first, do an x-ray of your lumbar spine and hip.

PATIENT Y471

PATIENT Y471
Is this like something that my body gotta build up to?  Is this going to cause dizziness or anything @@@?

DOCTOR Y471
