Since you're having these, your cholesterol was a little bit high when we checked in February.  Uh do you have any family history of heart disease or heart attacks and strokes, anything like that?

DOCTOR H943
Greenish okay.  Does this happen often throughout the year?

PATIENT H943
Yeah.

DOCTOR H943
That you'll get a cough and greenish phlegm, kind of some issues down there with your throat with stuff in there.

PATIENT H943
Yeah.

DOCTOR H943
That happens a few times through the year?

PATIENT H943
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H943
Okay.  It’s possible you have a bronchitis.  Do you know what that is, bronchitis?

PATIENT H943
Hmm, a breathing problem?

DOCTOR H943
It's like an infection in the central airway where bacteria can grow in here.  I don't think it's in the lungs, your lungs sound very good but you probably have a bronchitis which is inflammation of the bronchi or tracheitis. 

SECOND PERSON H943
Yeah.

DOCTOR H943
Um with the fevers and chills you say you've been having as well, we might want to give you a similar antibiotics to what the doctor gave you when you saw him in February, the azithromycin antibiotics that you took back then.  We'll probably give you some @@@ to break up the mucous @@@ so I'm gonna go and talk with um my boss a little bit more about it, okay.  Then I'll come back and we'll talk more.  You just wait here and I'll come go talk to him and be right back.

PATIENT H943
Okay.

DOCTOR H943
Um but you are motivated to quit smoking right?

PATIENT H943
Yes.

DOCTOR H943
I could give you some.

PATIENT H943
Yeah.

DOCTOR H943
Information right, okay.  You don't want to get the flu vaccine today either?

PATIENT H943
Huh?

DOCTOR H943
You don't want to get the flu vaccine today?

PATIENT H943
No.

DOCTOR H943
Okay.

PATIENT H943
Where would I get it at?

DOCTOR H943
Well the nurse wrote a note saying that you refused it earlier today.

PATIENT H943
No that's not right I'll wait.

DOCTOR H943
You'll wait.

PATIENT H943
Yeah.

DOCTOR H943
It's a good thing to have in this season, especially this year with all the comorbidities that you have, the high blood pressure; you know the hypertension and the hyperlipidemia.

PATIENT H943
Would I get it once I leave here?

DOCTOR H943
We can give it to you still when you leave today.  Probably a good idea for you.

PATIENT H943
Okay.

DOCTOR H943
I’ll be right back. Have you ever seen a pulmonary doctor?

PATIENT H943
Not that I know.

DOCTOR H943
Alright I'll be right back.

PATIENT H943
Okay.

(DOCTOR OUT:  71:03  DOCTOR IN:  79:20)

DOCTOR H943
You're gonna have an EKG done while you're here okay.

PATIENT H943
Okay.

DOCTOR H943
And um and we're gonna order some tests because some of the symptoms that you describe are you know a little bit concerning given your risk factors there may be something going on with your heart okay.  So we're gonna have you go over and uh they're gonna take the EKG now.  Do you know what an EKG is?  They put those little things on there to check the electricity of the heart and then um I'll have you go over to the Heart Clinic and then they'll schedule you for a couple of tests.  One is a stress test; do you know what a stress test is?

PATIENT H943
No I heard about it.

DOCTOR H943
Yeah.  Basically um they give you some medications to put a little bit of stress on the heart, makes it beat fast when it makes the vessels dilate, putting a little stress on the heart and then they take images of the heart and they see if there's any evidence if there's lack of blood flow in the heart.  That's called a stress test.  So they put stress on the heart and they visualize significant strain on it and um so we can have that scheduled.  It's probably not going to be able to get done today but we can have you go over there and get it checked.  Um we're also going to do a lung test, a pulmonary function test considering you're a smoker and with your symptoms that you have now um you probably have something called COPD or emphysema seeing that you’ve been smoking for a long time.  So we'll have to see, not now, I’m thinking you know with your cough and so on, but once that's resolved we should schedule you to get that done.  Basically @@@.  


(Someone knocked on the door)  The EKG technician tells the patient to prepare and he'll come back with the machine.

PATIENT H943
Okay.

DOCTOR H943
The pulmonary test is you'll sit in a little, kind of in a box and then they'll give you a tube that you breathe into pretty hard and then they measure the volume of your lungs, it's called a pulmonary function test and we'll get that checked as well.  And then we'll also I'll give you some antibiotics and some medication to loosen the phlegm so you can cough it out and the albuterol.

PATIENT H943
They said that if I want to see a dentist I have to talk to my primary doctor.

DOCTOR H943
Yes.  We could possibly, um I can refer you over there to see if they'll see you or not.  I don't know.  It's a little bit more complicated than that like they have all sorts of conditions allowing you to be seen in the Dental Clinic but we can refer you.  Yes.  The EKG technician performs the EKG.

DOCTOR H943
What's your phone number PATIENT?

PATIENT H943
Uh NUMBER.

DOCTOR H943
NUMBER.

PATIENT H943
NUMBER.

DOCTOR H943
Uh-huh.

PATIENT H943
NUMBER.

DOCTOR H943
Okay.  The EKG looks okay.  Alright I'm gonna go show this to the boss; I'll be back pretty soon.  It looks pretty good here.  I'll be right back.

(DOCTOR OUT:  90:31  DOCTOR IN:  91:14)

DOCTOR H943
You can put your shirt back on.  So if this chest pain comes back you should definitely come in to Urgent Care or the Emergency Room to evaluate it okay.  

PATIENT H943
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H943
And also we'll send you over for these tests um.  Couple things you're gonna need to do um.

PATIENT H943
Huh?

DOCTOR H943
A couple things you're gonna need to do cause there's you know a lot going on so the first thing is um you can go to the nurse and you can get your vaccine.

PATIENT H943
Okay.

DOCTOR H943
The flu vaccine right.

PATIENT H943
Yes.

DOCTOR H943
And um after that you can go to the Lab.  Do you know where the Lab is, across the hall?

SECOND PERSON H943
Yes.

PATIENT H943
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR H943
And you get your blood work done um and then you probably won't be able to get it done today but uh whenever you have time between Monday and Friday 8 and 4 p.m., 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. you can come over to the 8th floor of the hospital, Damen Building and that's where they'll do the pulmonary test so the pulmonary test has been ordered, the lung test has been ordered but it’s probably too late to get it done today so next time you have a free morning or afternoon, sometime between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. you could come back and then come up to the 8th floor, I'll write it down here, 8th Damon Building and you can go and get your pulmonary function test.

PATIENT H943
Okay.

DOCTOR H943
Um and then the same thing with the stress test.  After you go to the Lab you may be able to get it scheduled if you go over to the Heart Center.  When you go to the front to have your appointment made to see me again you can ask them where the Cardiac Clinic is and they can point you in that direction so you can have them schedule you.

PATIENT H943
Okay.

DOCTOR H943
So you have to get a couple of things, number one is the vaccine, the flu vaccine, then go to the Lab, this is one and this is two then you can go um three is the Cardiac Clinic for the stress @@@ follow-up appointment, one, two, three, four, five.  Um and if you want you can have your medications picked up or do you want them mailed to you or what would you prefer?

PATIENT H943
What I'll be getting?

DOCTOR H943
So you're gonna be getting azithromycin which is an antibiotic that you'll take for a couple days and that should help to clear up the coughing and the phlegm and so on, we'll also give you a pill that will help to loosen up the phlegm.

PATIENT H943
Okay.

DOCTOR H943
And then we're gonna refill the albuterol and your other medications.  

PATIENT H943
Uh, so not the blood pressure pill?

DOCTOR H943

DOCTOR H943
Yeah I can give you something for that too and have it mailed to you or you can pick it up, which would you prefer?

SECOND PERSON H943
How long the Pharmacy open?

DOCTOR H943
It's open till 5; it might be a little late.  After you get your blood work done, the vaccine and everything so it might be late, so it might be better to have it mailed to you.

PATIENT H943
Okay then mail it out to me.  How long that will take?

DOCTOR H943
A couple days.

PATIENT H943
Okay.  Yeah okay.  What about for my back that's uh.

No, just the Tylenol.

DOCTOR H943
Just the Tylenol.  So maybe you can try.  Let me see here @@@ might be helpful.

Okay.

DOCTOR H943
Its 25 mg, you take it three times a day um up to three times a day as needed for the pain.

PATIENT H943
Okay.

DOCTOR H943
