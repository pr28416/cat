DOCTOR F321
PATIENT?

PATIENT F321
Hmm.

DOCTOR F321
How you doing?

PATIENT F321
Good to see you.

DOCTOR F321
You too, how are you?

PATIENT F321
I'm fine and yourself?

DOCTOR F321
I'm alright.  Alright, so how have things been since I saw you last?

PATIENT F321
Oh, sucky.

DOCTOR F321
What's wrong?

PATIENT F321
Can't seem to get my blood down.

DOCTOR F321
Alright so how high have you been?

PATIENT F321
It's been uh, I think well I'm averaging lately about 244.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  You're taking metformin??

PATIENT F321
Twice a day.

DOCTOR F321
1000 mg twice a day.

PATIENT F321
Yep.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  And you're checking once a day now?

PATIENT F321
Uh yeah.  I'm going usually about uh once a day when I'm up in the 240+ range.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.

PATIENT F321
And every other day when I'm closer to 2.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  Now this seems uh you know, we don't have a hemoglobin A1c on you in a while.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
But um this seems higher than it was before.

PATIENT F321
Yeah but I got a lot of stress going on.

DOCTOR F321
A lot of stress.

PATIENT F321
A lot of stress.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  Um are you eating differently?

PATIENT F321
Everything I can.

DOCTOR F321
You're eating a lot?

PATIENT F321
Well I'm eating small amounts throughout the day.

DOCTOR F321
Okay, like what kind of foods are we talking about here?

PATIENT F321
Uh what kind of foods.  Uh oatmeal in the morning.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
Um no milk or sugar.  Um then a sandwich in the afternoon and then probably a larger meal around 4 o'clock and then a snack of some sort in the evening about 8 o'clock.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  Are these things that have a lot of sugar in them, like cookies?

PATIENT F321
Of course.

DOCTOR F321
Okay and this is eating out of stress or what's going on?

PATIENT F321
Nervous eating I think.

DOCTOR F321
Nerves okay.

PATIENT F321
See I work out of my home so I have access to the refrigerator downstairs.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.

PATIENT F321
That's a problem.  It was better when I was exercising, I mean when I was walking which I haven't been doing and I probably in all fairness will not do it as long as it's winter.

DOCTOR F321
Do you have any way to exercise in your home or do you belong to the gym?

PATIENT F321
No.

DOCTOR F321
Cause you've also gained some weight since the last time you were here.

PATIENT F321
Yeah I think I've gained a couple pounds.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah.

PATIENT F321
And I feel it.

DOCTOR F321
Alright so we've got to get you on a different trajectory here.  Right now we're going in the wrong direction.

PATIENT F321
I am on a downhill slope.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah.

PATIENT F321
And I feel it.

DOCTOR F321
So the stress, what are you doing to deal with the stress other than eating?

PATIENT F321
Oh not a thing.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.

PATIENT F321
You know, I sleep about six hours a night and uh then I just get up and start doing what I got to do.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh, okay.  So walking, exercising does that help you feel better?

PATIENT F321
Evidently it does.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah.  Yeah.

PATIENT F321
But.

DOCTOR F321
But you're not doing that.

PATIENT F321
I'm not doing that.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  Alright cause that you know, that's one of the best ways, everything is going to be interrelated for you.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
So.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
If you can exercise well first of all you'll just feel better, your blood sugars will be better.  

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
You'll feel better overall and it helps a lot of people deal with stress to exercise like that.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Sorry, I have post-nasal drip.  Every time I start talking I start coughing alright but in the meantime, I mean we'll check your hemoglobin A1c again today and see what your average blood sugars have been for the last three months.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Um and um but we should make some changes to your medications to manage your blood sugars in the meantime okay.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
And what can you do to change your eating?  Would you like to see the nutritionist?

PATIENT F321
I've seen the nutritionist.

DOCTOR F321
So you know what's in your food.

PATIENT F321
I do yeah.

DOCTOR F321
You look at nutrition labels?

PATIENT F321
Uh no I don't you know. Um I'm the type of person who will make a bowl of spaghetti and eats the leftovers the next day, whatever is left in the frig.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.

PATIENT F321
I'll eat while I'm working.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
So.

DOCTOR F321
Can we change that?

PATIENT F321
Change that?  We can do anything.

DOCTOR F321
Right.  I mean what I would do is try to I mean you can do something like keeping a log of what you're eating.

PATIENT F321
On my intake?

DOCTOR F321
Yeah just to make yourself a little more cognizant of what you're eating.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
And if you're holding yourself accountable in that way some people find it's easier to say well maybe I don't really need these cookies considering I've already eaten some spaghetti and some you know had some juice and whatever else.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
Um today so you know and then you'll see the correlation between days where eating more sugar with your blood sugars getting worse.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
So that's, that's maybe one idea we can use to, to eat a little bit less hopefully um.

PATIENT F321
And exercise more.

DOCTOR F321
Yes

PATIENT F321
See these are things I know I'm supposed to be doing.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah I know, maybe reminding you of all of these things.  I'm going to get this page, give me one moment.

PATIENT F321
Alright, alright.

DOCTOR F321
(Doctor answers page)  Um otherwise any problems like fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation?

PATIENT F321
Hmm, um I've had an upset stomach for a while.

DOCTOR F321
How long? Like months? Years?

PATIENT F321
Ah a couple weeks.

DOCTOR F321
Weeks okay.

PATIENT F321
Couple.

DOCTOR F321
Uh and what do you mean by upset stomach?

PATIENT F321
Oh just a little uh, maybe it's more like a nervous stomach you know.

DOCTOR F321
Okay like what do you feel or what happens?  Is it um feeling like heartburn, indigestion?

PATIENT F321
Well yeah.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah.

PATIENT F321
More like a heartburn, an acid reflux or something yeah.

DOCTOR F321
Is it worse at night when you lay down?

PATIENT F321
No, no.

DOCTOR F321
What times do you?

PATIENT F321
Usually about midday.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  Okay and have you tried anything for that?

PATIENT F321
Um I may have a sandwich and a glass of milk.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  So are you eating to try and uh.

PATIENT F321
Sometimes yeah.

DOCTOR F321
Alleviate some of the discomfort in your stomach okay.  Alright.  Well we kind of, I think it sounds like maybe you've got some acid reflux.  It can go on with stress, that's another thing that can go along with stress.  So we kind of have two options for treating that or to see if they help you.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
And the first one would be to take something as needed like Tums or something like that.

PATIENT F321
Right.

DOCTOR F321
Have you tried that at all?

PATIENT F321
Well sometimes that helps.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
And I haven't, it hasn't gotten to the point where I need Tums.

DOCTOR F321
Okay, but you eat instead.

PATIENT F321
Yeah, I would rather have a sandwich than a Tums.

DOCTOR F321
Alright maybe what we could do instead is try um something that you take every day.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
It takes a few weeks to build up in your system and then um and it'll work on suppressing the amount of acid in your stomach, decreasing the amount of irritation you have in your stomach and your esophagus.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
And then hopefully things will get, you know it'll prevent that feeling from coming on at all.

PATIENT F321
Actually coming here motivates me.  

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
Not so much seeing you, although I enjoy seeing you.  It's because I see the other veterans and their condition and I don't want to get to that point.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
Okay, so that's kind of a motivating factor.

DOCTOR F321
Yep and it's, that's just fine.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
That's you know.

PATIENT F321
So.

DOCTOR F321
I want this, the goal in this clinic is to help you take care of yourself and prevent you from developing a lot of complications.

PATIENT F321
Right.

DOCTOR F321
That happens to a lot of these vets okay.  Alright now this, do you ever get pain in your stomach.

PATIENT F321
No.

DOCTOR F321
Or is it like a nausea feeling that you get or?

PATIENT F321
It's more of a heartburn.

DOCTOR F321
Heartburn okay.  Cause if you ever develop pain in your stomach.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
That's relieved by eating.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
That's something we should talk about cause that can be a sign of an ulcer.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Alright and uh if you have an ulcer we should have you see a gastroenterologist and get that addressed okay.  Now last time you were here or back in February.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
We checked your cholesterol levels and they were kind of borderline.  For someone with diabetes they were you know we have a really strict idea of what we want your cholesterol level to be.  Yours were like at the borderline and we didn't feel like we needed to start a medication for them.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Then because um you were doing a good job as far as your diet and exercise.  Now I would anticipate that these are going to be worse if we were to check them again today.

PATIENT F321
Yeah what was my cholesterol?

DOCTOR F321
Last time you were here your total cholesterol was 142.  The most important number that we look at is your bad cholesterol, your LDL which was 82.

PATIENT F321
Oh.

DOCTOR F321
Now for your average person that would be a great number but for a diabetic we want them to be under 70.  We want to see 70 or less.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Alright. 

PATIENT F321
So would think that my LDL would be higher than 82.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.  Based on what you're telling me about your diet and not exercising both of them really help it.

PATIENT F321
Right.

DOCTOR F321
So I think we should check it again.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
If they are significantly higher I think we should start a medication to treat your cholesterol and bring it down.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Um once we get a handle on everything else.

PATIENT F321
Fine.

DOCTOR F321
Okay now have you eaten yet today?

PATIENT F321
I have.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.

PATIENT F321
I had a bowl of oatmeal.

DOCTOR F321
Would it be possible for you to come back another time on an empty stomach and get blood drawn?

PATIENT F321
Uh well I can always come back.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.  Okay cause we have to do these labs the first thing in the morning, have you fast for 12 hours.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
And then get the blood drawn.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Um and what else.  I think that's pretty much all you're due for.  Your blood pressure looks great today.  Um you saw the ophthalmologist, they didn't see any problems.

PATIENT F321
I see him again today.

DOCTOR F321
Okay good, good um.  No signs of kidney problems related to the diabetes.

PATIENT F321
No.

DOCTOR F321
And you've been seeing the podiatrist.

PATIENT F321
Now remember I had the kidney stone removed in January.

DOCTOR F321
Are you still seeing a urologist?

PATIENT F321
Um no but I am on a medication um and I brought the bottle but I forgot to bring it up.

DOCTOR F321
Oh okay.

PATIENT F321
Yeah.

DOCTOR F321
Um cause right now all I have as far as the medications that you're taking is the metformin and then we're ordering your test strips through here.

PATIENT F321
Right.

DOCTOR F321
And you're on something for your prostate?

PATIENT F321
Uh with the doctor that I was seeing yeah.

DOCTOR F321
Okay so you're not seeing him anymore?

PATIENT F321
No I'm not scheduled till later in the year.

DOCTOR F321
Oh okay.  Is it like something to shrink your prostate cause yours was enlarged?

PATIENT F321
Yes he thought it was larger than normal.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.

PATIENT F321
And I just told him I just had a large prostate.

DOCTOR F321
But you did, okay.  Um is it like Flomax or?

PATIENT F321
No.

DOCTOR F321
Um uh, I forget the brand names um like finasteride.

PATIENT F321
No, starts with an O I think.

DOCTOR F321
Starts with an O?  Hmm.

PATIENT F321
Well.

DOCTOR F321
Your PSA, I know we talked about this before.

PATIENT F321
Right.

DOCTOR F321
Your PSA was high when we took it here.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
And you said it's been high in the past.

PATIENT F321
Yes.

DOCTOR F321
Have you ever had a biopsy of your prostate?

PATIENT F321
I have, I did not like it.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah.  Alright so can we get, I really like to get reports from your urologist of whatever they found.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Or whatever evidence they have that this is you know that there's no prostate cancer cause that's what the elevated PSA is suggestive of.

PATIENT F321
Right.

DOCTOR F321
@@@.

PATIENT F321
They don't think I ever had @@@.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
So that I don't have to uh have problems down the road.

DOCTOR F321
Right um so that, if they could just send us whatever like biopsy results they have or anything, just so we can have it on our record and we can stop asking you about it.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Um I can give you our fax number here and they can go ahead and fax it to me.  That way you don't have to @@@.

PATIENT F321
Well actually the only person I explain this to is you so.

DOCTOR F321
Alright then it'll make me feel better.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
Um okay so our fax number here is @@@-@@@-@@@@.  So why don't you have a seat up here.

Oh the shortness of breath?

DOCTOR F321
Yeah.

PATIENT F321

DOCTOR F321
Climbing a flight of stairs?

Top and they leave a mark and it goes away.

DOCTOR F321
It looks like you might have a little bit of swelling in your legs.

PATIENT F321
Well you know, as I told you previously and you probably don't recall it is I do have traces of gout.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
Sometimes it comes and goes or I really don't know what gout is but when it becomes inflamed I can tell a couple days before it starts.

DOCTOR F321
And where do you get that?  What joints?

PATIENT F321
Uh either the knee.

DOCTOR F321

PATIENT F321
Or the ankle.

DOCTOR F321

DOCTOR F321
To prevent it from happening.  Do you get medication when you have a flare?

PATIENT F321
Uh no.  I'll take uh Tylenol.

DOCTOR F321
Okay and how long does it take for it to go way usually?

PATIENT F321

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
Uh I start taking Tylenol two tablets three times a day.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321

DOCTOR F321
Okay.

PATIENT F321
And it'll be around for three days and then it'll stop.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  Do they get real red and inflamed?

PATIENT F321
No I can just feel it.  I can feel it's tender sometimes.

DOCTOR F321
Okay you can come back and have a seat.  Alright so we have.

PATIENT F321
But I believe that's my diet also.

DOCTOR F321
Okay, eating a lot of red meat and things like that?

PATIENT F321
Cause I think it's.

DOCTOR F321
Does red meat trigger it or alcohol?

PATIENT F321
It's probably more of alcohol.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
Because I really do not drink a lot but when I do because it's hot and you know or there's some sort of event, it'll come down the road a few days later.

DOCTOR F321

PATIENT F321

DOCTOR F321
Enjoying the view?

PATIENT F321
@@@ window.

DOCTOR F321
Alright so what we're going to do.  I think we can wait on getting your uh cholesterol checked for the time being.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Um but I would like to check your hemoglobin A1c and your kidney function and stuff today.  So if you can stay and get some labs today we'll take care of that.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
Um and we can add another medication for your diabetes to try and get that under control.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
Um you know in dealing with whatever this stress is that you have in your life is going to be key.  It's going to be key in controlling your blood sugar.

PATIENT F321
Exactly.

DOCTOR F321
Your weight and everything.  Is there anything that you can do about that?  I mean you said you're working from home.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
Um and is it just trying to get the work done or is it dealing with colleagues or?

PATIENT F321
No I have um; I deal in the foreclosure market.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
Um you know doing short sales and helping businesses and homeowners uh keep their businesses going.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah.

PATIENT F321
So um it's a financial stress.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah.

PATIENT F321
You know we're not always successful.

DOCTOR F321
Right.

PATIENT F321
So.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  Um.

PATIENT F321
It's just the nature of the job.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah.  Is there a lot of anxiety that you're feeling related to it?

PATIENT F321
No I think it's more a frustration.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.

PATIENT F321
Yeah.

DOCTOR F321
Alright.  Alright, do you think talking with someone would help you deal with it?

PATIENT F321
No because uh I've been doing this for a long time.  I pretty much uh understand that you know there's a lot items out of my control.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
So.

DOCTOR F321
Alright.  But it's still affecting your.

PATIENT F321
Well it affects me because its, you know I'm still dealing with people and you know what's going on in their lives.

DOCTOR F321
Right, right, right.

PATIENT F321
So.

DOCTOR F321
Hmm.

PATIENT F321
I was listening to the radio coming in and uh they said that the poverty levels in the suburbs have gone up.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
And um you know Naperville, the poverty has gone up in the suburbs 70%, in Charles 120%, Romeoville where I live is 500%.  

DOCTOR F321
Wow.

PATIENT F321
So there's a lot of it going on and you know I'm trying to help people keep their houses.

DOCTOR F321
@@@.

PATIENT F321
Or move on to the next.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
Situation.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.  As cleanly as possible.

PATIENT F321
That's just you know the price of business.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah.

PATIENT F321
If I didn't care I wouldn't have the stress.

DOCTOR F321
Yes.  Yeah but I don't want this to have such a large negative impact on your health.

PATIENT F321
Well I just think it's, I just think as the economy gets worse, which it will continue to do, there's just going to be more of it.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
Fortunately I can only do so much.

DOCTOR F321
Right.

PATIENT F321
So.

DOCTOR F321
Alright well I don't want this to keep you.

PATIENT F321
No.  I'll just go home and drink.

DOCTOR F321
That's really true but this can be just as bad like when we talk about you, you see some of the veterans here who.

PATIENT F321
Right.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah and so it's, we don't want what's happening now affect you much further down the road.

PATIENT F321
Right.

DOCTOR F321
Alright cause.

PATIENT F321
But if you give you an assignment, which you have, of monitoring my intake.

DOCTOR F321
Uh-huh.

PATIENT F321
Uh I'll do that.

DOCTOR F321
Okay, alright and we'll see how it goes and we're going to start this new medication.  Do you want to pick it up at the Pharmacy or have them mailed to you?

PATIENT F321
Oh just have it mailed to me.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  So.

PATIENT F321
What is it?

DOCTOR F321
Um glipizide is the name of it.  It's another oral medication that is going to work in a slightly different way.

PATIENT F321
Is it in replace of or in addition to?

DOCTOR F321
No in addition to.

PATIENT F321
Okay are there any side effects?

DOCTOR F321
Well the one thing that can.

PATIENT F321
Will it make me sexy or something?

DOCTOR F321
It can make your blood sugar drop low.  Unlike metformin, it's very rare with metformin to have a low blood sugar because it works in a different way but this medication is going to increase your own secretion of insulin and so sometimes the side effect can be low blood sugars.  We're starting you on a dose that probably won't have that affect given what your blood sugars are.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
But I would like to um you know, I'd like you to keep checking just like you are.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
And every once in a while.  Are these mostly fasting blood sugars in the morning that you're checking or are they during the day?

PATIENT F321
Usually in the morning.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah so let's try checking maybe one day a week check a blood sugar before dinnertime.

PATIENT F321
Okay.

DOCTOR F321
And see where things are there, at that time of day, so we know what your fluctuation is okay.  And today we'll do, we'll just check a couple labs.  Um and give us a call, maybe in a month and if you can give us a call and just tell us how your blood sugars are doing.

PATIENT F321
Alright.  Who do I call?

DOCTOR F321
I have a number here.  Um you can call, I'll have you call the nursing like hot line and then they'll send the message along to me.  So the phone number is @@@-@@@-@@@@.  Oh and the last thing I wanted to do, just for your stomach in the meantime.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
Is give you that medication we were talking about, it's called omeprazole and I'll have you take it for a month.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
And then you can stop.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

It will work to decrease the acid secretion in your stomach.  Hopefully you won't be eating to try and you know.

PATIENT F321
Help me give it up.

DOCTOR F321
Yeah I mean what you're trying to do is neutralize that acid.

PATIENT F321
Uh-huh.

DOCTOR F321
And create a barrier to protect your stomach.  That's why, especially milk, things like that are counteracting the acid so, so do it for a month and see if that helps.

PATIENT F321
Okay.  That's not something I would have to stay on?

DOCTOR F321
No.  Hopefully after a month it gives your stomach some time to heal.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
And then most people are able to stop.  If it does persist then that's a sign that something a little bit more worrisome is going on and we'll have you checked out by the gastroenterologist okay.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
Alright so.  I want you to come back and see me in three months.  We'll get the hemoglobin A1c.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
And check the electrolytes today.  Um and have you give us a call in about a month and let me know how your blood sugars are doing.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
And if you're getting low blood sugars give a call too.

PATIENT F321
And where do I go again for the?

DOCTOR F321
We'll see if they can get you in out here.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
You know it looks like she's not here, so we'll have you go down to the Lab to have your labs drawn.

PATIENT F321
Alright

DOCTOR F321
Alright so I'll give you this and you can turn that in at the front and you'll head down to the first floor for blood work.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
Okay.  I won't shake your hand.

PATIENT F321
Alright.

DOCTOR F321
I'll give you a call if there are any problems with the labs.

PATIENT F321
Okay.  Thank you.
